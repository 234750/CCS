Good movie! A little confusing at first but tje story all comes together in awesome way and makes it a really good and satisfying movie.,positive
This movie was not as criminally bad as some might think.  It was hard to get invested overall since it took place in the past. While the character herself is very consequential the story was not. Knowing the future of this story might have hurt it. Perhaps had this movie was one of the first in MCU it would have been better. Humor had its moments. I am glad it did. It was not Ragnarok levels but it was good. The biggest hit it took was being formulaic to a damaging level. Marvel had been doing a good job of keeping it as fresh as possible as of late. I think the 90's theme was supposed to help but they didn't hit you hard enough with it. Some tweaks would have made this a very good movie. Which is why it was not a very bad movie. I think that is a win.,positive
just the worst piece of garbage I have watched ion a long time.,negative
I've always thought that most huge box-office flops usually have something to recommend them but after the remake of Around the World in 80 Days and Thunderbirds I'm beginning to doubt it. For those not familiar it's based on a puppet show about a family of astronauts who use state of the art rockets spaceships and subs to rescue people from various disasters (falling bridges stricken planes burning buildings etc) each week. Well the puppets are gone (replaced by far more lifeless teenagers) and so is the premise - only one ineptly staged rescue and a plot shamelessly ripped off from Spy Kids without any signs of imagination wit or entertainment. Young Alan Tracey feels left out of all the rescuing we never see the other Traceys do because dad won't let him play with a real rocket until he passes his exams. Grounded on a beautiful tropical island (some punishment!) his chance to shine comes when the rest of the family - a bunch of identikit bleach-blondes who look like a gay neo-Nazi boy band without a single bit of characterisation between them - are stranded in space and he has to have the day by er running around the jungle making a phone call firing a hose at the inept comedy relief villains and dousing them in gunk for bad measure.<br /><br />The good points are few and far between. One of them is that the film is mostly in focus. The other is they all got to go to the Seychelles which looks nice.<br /><br />The bad points: where to start? Ben Kingsley's career lowpoint performance? The aforementioned inept comedy relief sidekicks who would disgrace the Children's Film Foundation at its worst? The almost complete lack of action or effects in a $70m sci-fi film? The terrible script the lifeless direction the odious moralising? But most of all is the fact that the film is so patronising in every possible way. Forget the life lessons and off the peg sentiment this is a movie aimed straight at the under-eights by people who know they're making a kid's movie and are constantly talking down to their intended audience throwing in fifth-rate jokes and routines that would insult most children who had only recently mastered the art of speech. This film could replace being sent to bed early without their dinner as parents' favourite punishment for kids.<br /><br />The biggest flop in British film history (it didn't even cover the cost of prints and marketing) it's just about watchable if only as an object lesson in how NOT to make a summer movie.,negative
Maybe the worst MCU film ever made.  I'm including the earlyHulk films.  Does not respect source material. I ate this film.  The actress is wooden.  The plot is contrived.  Horrible,negative
Captain Marvel starts off as an interesting film. I couple great action sequences. Then as the film goes on it gets work. Captain Marvel is so powerful I feel no tension or any high stakes when the plot is playing out. Brie Larson is a mediocre actress at best and Captain Marvel has to be one of the most boring heroes in the MCU. Not a bad movie but I can't say I recommend it either.,negative
Woke and full of social justice crap. The franchise has been ruined. I am fed up with the feminist propaganda and their agenda.,controversial
