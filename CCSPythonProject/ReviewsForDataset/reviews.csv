Good movie! A little confusing at first but tje story all comes together in awesome way and makes it a really good and satisfying movie.,positive
"This movie was not as criminally bad as some might think.  It was hard to get invested overall since it took place in the past. While the character herself is very consequential, the story was not. Knowing the future of this story might have hurt it. Perhaps, had this movie was one of the first in MCU, it would have been better. Humor had its moments. I am glad it did. It was not Ragnarok levels but it was good. The biggest hit it took was being formulaic to a damaging level. Marvel had been doing a good job of keeping it as fresh as possible as of late. I think the 90's theme was supposed to help but they didn't hit you hard enough with it. Some tweaks would have made this a very good movie. Which is why it was not a very bad movie. I think that is a win.",positive
just the worst piece of garbage I have watched ion a long time.,negative
"I've always thought that most huge box-office flops usually have something to recommend them, but after the remake of Around the World in 80 Days and Thunderbirds, I'm beginning to doubt it. For those not familiar, it's based on a puppet show about a family of astronauts who use state of the art rockets, spaceships and subs to rescue people from various disasters (falling bridges, stricken planes, burning buildings, etc) each week. Well, the puppets are gone (replaced by far more lifeless teenagers), and so is the premise - only one ineptly staged rescue and a plot shamelessly ripped off from Spy Kids without any signs of imagination, wit or entertainment. Young Alan Tracey feels left out of all the rescuing we never see the other Traceys do because dad won't let him play with a real rocket until he passes his exams. Grounded on a beautiful tropical island (some punishment!), his chance to shine comes when the rest of the family - a bunch of identikit bleach-blondes who look like a gay neo-Nazi boy band without a single bit of characterisation between them - are stranded in space and he has to have the day by, er, running around the jungle, making a phone call, firing a hose at the inept comedy relief villains and dousing them in gunk for bad measure.<br /><br />The good points are few and far between. One of them is that the film is mostly in focus. The other is they all got to go to the Seychelles, which looks nice.<br /><br />The bad points: where to start? Ben Kingsley's career lowpoint performance? The aforementioned inept comedy relief sidekicks who would disgrace the Children's Film Foundation at its worst? The almost complete lack of action or effects in a $70m sci-fi film? The terrible script, the lifeless direction, the odious moralising? But most of all is the fact that the film is so patronising in every possible way. Forget the life lessons and off the peg sentiment, this is a movie aimed straight at the under-eights by people who know they're making a kid's movie and are constantly talking down to their intended audience, throwing in fifth-rate jokes and routines that would insult most children who had only recently mastered the art of speech. This film could replace being sent to bed early without their dinner as parents' favourite punishment for kids.<br /><br />The biggest flop in British film history (it didn't even cover the cost of prints and marketing), it's just about watchable if only as an object lesson in how NOT to make a summer movie.",negative
Maybe the worst MCU film ever made.  I'm including the earlyHulk films.  Does not respect source material. I ate this film.  The actress is wooden.  The plot is contrived.  Horrible,negative
Captain Marvel starts off as an interesting film. I couple great action sequences. Then as the film goes on it gets work. Captain Marvel is so powerful I feel no tension or any high stakes when the plot is playing out. Brie Larson is a mediocre actress at best and Captain Marvel has to be one of the most boring heroes in the MCU. Not a bad movie but I can't say I recommend it either.  ,negative

"I understand that this movie is made for kids and as a parent I have sat through many movies that don't particularly hold my interest, but I can appreciate from a constructive point of view in how it is being received by my children. Parents are supposed to be encouraged after all to take part in their children's activities and to monitor the quality of the entertainment that they view so there should be something that appeals to an adult audience on some level even in children's movies. Disney has always understood this which is why it is so hard to fathom how it could allow such a complete piece of drek to bear their name.<br /><br />Technically, the sound editing is horrible and all dialog sounds over-dubbed and unnatural. Personally I hate that, but it was doubly awful considering the dialog itself seemed as though it was written by a 12 year old for a school project. The ""acting"" reminded me of a school play and none of the child actors had any range of emotion in their voices. Thankfully it was a very short movie.<br /><br />Now, before I come off like a video-geek measuring a kids movie with an adult yard stick, the one thing that can save even the worst children's movie is a positive message. Far be it from me to determine how a message has to be delivered so long as the right one is. Let us take a walk through this film to see what messages are given: <br /><br />If you are lost, don't worry, you will inevitably find your way home.<br /><br />Approach wild animals without any fear.<br /><br />You can win any competition just because you ""know"" you can.<br /><br />and my favorite, the final message left in the film: <br /><br />It's okay to disobey authority figures and do what you think is right.",negative

There is nothing original in this movie to support it so they had to use something which is already famous.You know the recipe.

Most of them are well - known people in Romania and i must mention some of them are not even actors(e.g.Mihaela Radulescu).SO to summarize it: ""girl band tatty""+desperate/publicity needing ""actors""+ a non-existing plot+ the occasion to use bad language in order to shock= Love sick....too bad...the idea was good,though...and i am seriously holding myself from commenting the title...",negative

"1st watched 12/7/2002 - 3 out of 10(Dir-Steve Purcell): Typical Mary Kate & Ashley fare with a few more kisses. It looks to me like the girls are getting pretty tired of this stuff and it will be interesting what happens to them if they ever decide to split up and go there own ways. In this episode of their adventures they are interns in Rome for a `fashion' designer who puts them right into the mailroom to learn what working hard is all about(I guess..). Besides the typical flirtations with boys there is nothing much else except the Rome scenario until about ¾ way into the movie when it's finally revealed why they are getting fired, then re-hired, then fired again, then re-hired again. This is definetly made by people who don't understand the corporate world and it shows in their interpretation of it. Maybe the real world will be their next adventure(if there is one.). Even my kids didn't seem to care for this boring `adventure' in the make-believe. Let's see they probably only have a couple of years till their legal adults. We'll see what happens then.",negative
"Nothing revolutionary here; just impeccably elegant, restrained cinema.<br /><br />GARDE A VUE is confined almost exclusively to a drab police station, and mostly to one interrogation room, but director Claude Miller (who made the wonderful film THIS SWEET SICKNESS, among others) intercalates spare glimpses of exterior tableaux as minimalist locale scenography. Miller's restraint, especially early on, is breathtaking, and his exquisite handling of the consequently-pivotal interior mise-en-scene makes for captivating viewing.<br /><br />Lino Ventura is superb as usual, succeeding to legitimize a character that, on paper, is cliche: the laconic, hard-nosed, world-weary homicide detective. Ventura lives the role, making it completely believable, even though the script allows us little access to his inner workings; the film ends at the very moment it appears he will be forced to confront his failure for the first time.<br /><br />Michel Serrault is equal to the task as the suspected child-killer who shrewdly spars with the single-minded flic. The exchanges between the two are more-often-than-not pregnant with tension and the aura of a constantly metamorphosing playing field for a battle of wits. Serrault's character is by turns deplorably haughty and cunning, and pitiable; then later....<br /><br />The ""message"" of GARDE A VUE, if one were to search for one, is a condemnation of police methodology and the kind of pressures that make a cop over-zealous to, if necessary, close cases at the expense of justice. For most of its length though the film shines as nothing more than an exemplar of how to turn a potentially soporific set-bound scenario into a suspenseful drama of the utmost cinematic economy.<br /><br />",positive

I kind of liked that because so many marvel characters are overly witty and do that wink wink look at me I'm just pretending to be a super hero.",positive
"Well, ""Cube"" (1997), Vincenzo's first movie, was one of the most interesting and tricky ideas that I've ever seen when talking about movies. They had just one scenery, a bunch of actors and a plot. So, what made it so special were all the effective direction, great dialogs and a bizarre condition that characters had to deal like rats in a labyrinth. His second movie, ""Cypher"" (2002), was all about its story, but it wasn't so good as ""Cube"" but here are the characters being tested like rats again.<br /><br />""Nothing"" is something very interesting and gets Vincenzo coming back to his 'Cube days', locking the characters once again in a very different space with no time once more playing with the characters like playing with rats in an experience room. But instead of a thriller sci-fi (even some of the promotional teasers and trailers erroneous seemed like that), ""Nothing"" is a loose and light comedy that for sure can be called a modern satire about our society and also about the intolerant world we're living. Once again Vicenzo amaze us with a great idea into a so small kind of thing. 2 actors and a blinding white scenario, that's all you got most part of time and you don't need more than that. While ""Cube"" is a claustrophobic experience and ""Cypher"" confusing, ""Nothing"" is completely the opposite but at the same time also desperate.<br /><br />This movie proves once again that a smart idea means much more than just a millionaire budget. Of course that the movie fails sometimes, but its prime idea means a lot and offsets any flaws. There's nothing more to be said about this movie because everything is a brilliant surprise and a totally different experience that I had in movies since ""Cube"".",positive
"OK, let's get this clear. I'm really not into sci-fi, but for some reason I love Stargate SG-1. <br /><br />Jack O'Neil takes his team SG-1 through a Stargate. A round device that creates a wormhole. It gives you the ability to travel to distant worlds. It might sound like your usual sci-fi-series, but it's not! The plot is set today not in some distant millennium like many other sci-fi-series. I find that great. It gives you things, happenings and such you can relate to, and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names of all the gadgets. They have some of course but thanks to O'Neil who likes to keep a simple terminology, there's not many. <br /><br />The series has a nice blending of action, humor and drama. If you enjoy loads of special effects you're not going to find it here. They don't use many bad ones but a limited amount of well made special effects.",positive

"I saw this movie for the first time when Quentin Tarantino showed it to a bunch of us at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin. He prefaced it with how freaking awesome he thought he was and how funny it was and in the context of his explanation, it was HILARIOUS. I can see how it would be damaging to some audiences, and the subject is not funny at all, but there are at least three lines in the film that had me laughing so hard I thought I'd pee. They don't come until after the halfway point, but when they do, oh God...you will die. Oh and Jim Brown is brilliant. He's not in a lot of the movie, but when he's there, you know whose movie it is. Naturally, the best line in the movie (and the funniest) is his; you'll know it when you hear it.",positive

"Another very nice film from Marvel. If you like any of the other Marvel films, you're sure to like this one.nnThe pacing was great as I never felt bored and the action scenes were never drawn out more than they had to. CGI used with L.

"I thought the whole movie played out beautifully with fresh images and interesting cinematography the whole way through it. The actors were on top of their character's backs in nearly perfect timing and looked great. The music was lush and well-thought-out. It even had a decent twist of an ending. So what's with everyone voting it down? The story wasn't entirely fresh (felt like a remnant of ""Running Man"" with the whole television show idea), but the attitude towards Christianity and Judaism about how the public picks their Messiah certainly sounded true enough. It made sense to follow this one man who was put before a modern crowd and to put him on a pedestal because of his opportunity.<br /><br />It's possible that Christians or other religious people pick this up because the movie has the word ""God"" in it, but that shows what the filmmakers were trying to do is to teach a possibility to people who maybe never saw the world like this, especially in the modern world where Christianity has been more and more accepted and forgotten about by some.<br /><br />I gave it a 7/10 stars here on IMDb. I thought every ounce of the movie was entertaining and original, for the most-part. Check it out if you're not too offended to see an entertaining film from Madrid, Spain, about possibilities of the coming modern Messiah to a TV near you.",positive

Overall, though, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!nP.S.

"This film was seen by my wife and I when it came out in 1978. It was a revelation to us. We actually thought that we were the only gay and lesbian couple who had ever married and had children. Obviously we were wrong. Love may come from where you don't expect it and maybe don't want it. But we both chose that love anyway.<br /><br />And no, it never changed our sexual orientation. That kind of stuff is for the Christian wackos.<br /><br />When we were young we both had affairs, but never with the opposite sex. As we aged we stopped having extramarital affairs.<br /><br />This story is not far fetched. However, the suggestion that they became heterosexuals seems pretty unrealistic to me.

"It was overall an enjoyable film.  The plot/story was solid.  Acting was wonderful.  Effects were great.  Pretty much what you expect in a MCU movie.  nnMy one issue is that I felt overwhelmed (and perhaps a bit isolated) with the clear social agenda, it's delivery, and it's frequency.  It's perfectly fine to have that stuff in a film, especially now, and especially for this film.  But I felt that it could have had just a few great enlightening/inspiring moments on the topic.  Instead, I felt like they looked for every minuscule opportunity to and seized it.  And went as far as to create opportunities to go even further, where doing so felt forced.nnThat was the only bit that didn't sit right with me.

I was disappointed in the movie given all the hype. There was a SJW part but I expected that considering the reports of Brie's comments about reporters. I don't care. This was the same quality movie as the Incredible Hulk (2008), I may have actually enjoyed that movie more. This movie came across as trying too hard.",negative
"Deliriously romantic comedy with intertwining subplots that mesh beautifully and actors who bounce lines off each other with precise comic timing, a feat that is beautiful to behold.

Operatic symbolism, Catholic church confessions, love bites and falling snow...""Moonstruck"" is timeless and smooth. It takes about 15 minutes for the picture's rhythm to kick in (there's an early sequence with the grandfather and his dogs at the cemetery that's a little rough, and a following scene with Cosmo and the elderly man at the gate that seems obtuse), but the patchwork of the plot is interwoven with nimble skill, and the movie's wobbly tone and kooky spirit are both infectious. ***1/2 from ****",positive

Brie Larson and comedy moments don't work at all. Part of the MCU is excitement along with that light hearted comedy.

Second worst MCU film (Iron Man 2 wins that title). Brie Larson was a terrible casting decision. She lacks presence and any emotional depth in the film. The overall plot derails halfway through the film and attempts to throw some curveballs that do not land and lead to a very unsatisfying climax. Characters are introduced in a way that assumes we have some kind of emotional ties to them with little explanation of why they matter.

"Man on fire, is definitely one of the best drama/crime thrillers I have ever seen. Despite having a slow beginning the story is so amazingly complex and sensitive that it sticks together rather well. This is Denzel Washington's perfect role, in which he plays a body guard, called Creasy that is tormented by his past and is an alcoholic but never gives up on his duty to save his latest protégée, Pita. Dakota Fanning plays Pita, the very smart, enthusiastic little girl that loves so many things, and acts in a very convincing manner, she has a great future ahead of her. As I said the story is somewhat complicated, in order to fully understand it, you must watch it a couple of times.<br /><br />This film is made in two parts, there's the first hour, where everyone is happy, nothing's wrong, everyone's just living their lives happily until the kidnapping of Pita occurs and where Creasy is almost killed. And then there's the second part, the rest of the film, where suddenly everything becomes complicated and somewhat gruesome and disturbing, when Creasy's recovered from his severe injury and starts chasing and killing the numerous criminals and ""La Hermamdad"" that were responsible for the planning and execution of the kidnapping of Pita.<br /><br />Denzel Washington shows us his most up to date acting talents alongside many other talented actors which have a great future ahead of them. It is a real shame that this film hasn't been acknowledged enough, Washington really deserved another Oscar for his performance, and so did Fanning and the director. And even maybe the visual effects which were of very high quality.<br /><br />If you like excellent, slightly deranged, suspenseful thrillers, this is the one to see. The most amazing thing is that elements of this film are actually based on a real story and real characters! 10/10",positive

It's definitely up there in standards surpassing Bored of the Rings, and on par with movies like Harry Potter. Which is saying a lot for a movie again, made on a fraction of the budget of these international hits.<br /><br />One thing I really love about this movie is that it so stretches the envelope of adventure movie to come out of Hong Kong. The topic is exotic and original. Production quality is unlike anything seen coming out of HK for fantasy action movie, and acting is great.<br /><br />One of the best movies to come out of Hong Kong, this is the Infernal Affairs of Hong Kong fantasy movie, and I hope they'll continue working in this area, until they surpass Hollywood adventure movies.<br /><br />Just fantastic.",positive

"I really enjoyed this movie as a young kid. At that age I thought that the silly baseball antics were funny and that the movie was ""cool"" because of it's about sports. Now, several years later, I can look back and see what a well designed movie this was. This movie opened my eyes as a small child to the struggles other children dealt with and real world issues. That kind of exposure is largely lacking in kids movies these days which I don't think is to our society's benefit. Sure the baseball antics seem really dumb now, but they drew kids in. No seven year old is going to ask to see a movie about foster children, but they will ask to see a movie about baseball.

"first, The CGI of Samual L Jackson is AWESOME - unfortunately, that is the only good thing I can say about this flick.

She comes in waaaayyy to late in the game of 10+ yrs of Marvel movies with character development of heroes we've come to love.  Brie's character/performance does not have the likability, vulnerability, or human emotions that we have identified with other virtually every other character in MCU movies. And don't even get me started on her 3 minutes or so in End Game - that movie would have been successful without this forced political stunt character. ",controversial
Just watched it. Pretty disappointing.,negative
"Well, maybe the PC version of this game was impressive. Maybe. I just finished playing the PS2 version and it's pretty much a complete mess.<br /><br />There are a couple elements that are okay or promising. I'll mention those first because it will be over quickly. First, the idea of a historical GTA-like game is a great one. The game Gun was a historical GTA-like game and unlike Mafia, Gun was excellent. I'd love to see a game set during Mafia's era done right. Next, the storyline is well written. The story makes sense, it has dramatic arcs, it uses an unusual device (with much of the game being a backstory) and it's interesting. Finally, some of the graphics--especially those used during cutscenes--are impressive. Mafia's designers seemed to focus on getting the graphics right in the places where GTA skimped on that effort, especially the characters. Unfortunately in many other areas, the graphics kinda stink, and I'd much rather have excellent gameplay than impressive-looking characters.<br /><br />The gameplay is what sinks this title so low. First off, the controls and camera absolutely suck. That has to be the first focus of any game developers. You can't release a game where the controls and/or camera suck. Number one, there's no reason that the player's character, Tom, can't have his full range of motion controlled by the left analog stick. Unless it's absolutely necessary, and it hardly ever is, I hate the set-up where the left stick moves the character in a ""strafing"" way and the character can only turn using the right analog stick. Here, it's not only unnecessary, it makes most of the simplest actions a challenge. For example, Tom has to climb on a couple missions. But the game is designed so poorly that you have to frustratingly keep manipulating both the right analog stick and the camera, and then press L1 every time you need to climb, or Tom will descend instead.<br /><br />Next, I've never seen a worse fighting system. The first problem is that you can't auto-aim or lock on to any targets. At one early point, the game seems to tell you that you can use L2 or R2 to lock on to targets, but that never worked. So to focus on any enemy, you have to struggle with the stupid right analog stick and try to keep adjusting both the character's orientation and the camera, which tends to drift to the wrong angle or make Tom disappear all the time. By that time, you're probably getting pummeled or shot to death.<br /><br />Next, if you're touching or almost touching an enemy--and that's certainly going to be the case for hand to hand combat or when using melee weapons, the fighting system--which primarily consists of tapping or holding R1, is completely useless. Enemies can pummel you almost in a bear hug, but you just can't move unless you back off. So close fighting tends to consist of you yanking on the left analog stick, yelling at the character to move away, which it won't do 50% of the time, then tapping R1 as much as you can before the enemy gets too close again and makes R1 useless. And if the enemy changes their angle to you in the meantime, you're also going to struggle with the right analog stick to get your character oriented in the right way and to get the camera in position so you can see anything. By that time, you're probably getting pummeled or shot again, and your only option will be to try to move the character away again. My fights often consisted of making Tom run circles around an area like a comedy film, hoping that I could gain enough time to struggle with the analog stick and get a couple shots in before being at the AI's mercy again. So much for realistic fighting.<br /><br />And the same problems and more exist when trying to fight with guns. If you're touching someone, half the time the controller just won't allow you to fire off a shot, yet they can still riddle you full of holes. Additionally, there's no auto-aim, and the aiming system is ridiculously sensitive, even with the sensitivity set to zero under Options. Gunfights tend to consist of you hopelessly trying to aim or move away while the enemy puts shot after shot into you. Luckily or not, damage seems to be recorded almost randomly. It can take one to ten shots or more to incapacitate any character, and there's no rhyme or reason to it. You can put five shots into an enemy's head and near point blank range and they'll still return fire and hurt you. Yet, the game designers seemed to care enough about realism than they built a recoil into your aiming system, so after shots with powerful enough guns, your aim will float off target, and you'll have to fight with it again.<br /><br />As for the celebrated graphics, except for the characters and textures that you're close to, they're actually pretty disappointing. The distance always seems mostly empty, and there are often expanses of flat colors and textures nearby when you're driving. The city wasn't very well designed. It's not varied enough, and there aren't many interesting things to see or do. The cars seem slow and they're difficult to control. They also all drive about the same. Some have mentioned the music, but that was also pretty nondescript. A much better job could have been done on that end. Also, as many others have mentioned, the load times are ridiculous and constant. They tend to be over a minute long, and they occur between and in the middle of everything--even races.<br /><br />Overall, the Mafia port to PS2, at least, seems to have been very rushed. The game feels and plays like an incomplete hack job.",negative

Nothing but a nonsensical mess of softcore porn and a half-hearted attempt at a plot.<br /><br />Not much of anything here, other than cheap tricks and stupid scenes.

"The image of movie studios being financially-driven instead of creatively is not without truth (in fact, it's more true than false). This begs the question why Castle Rock Entertainment allowed Kenneth Branagh to create a full-length, uncut version of ""Hamlet"" with his complete creative control among other things. Of course, Branagh had to agree to some concessions (a star-studded cast, and a 2.5 hour version for wider release), but why would the film studio allow Branagh to spend money on a 4 hour version that they knew few would see? Could they have, at least in this case, had enough respect for the material and Branagh's vision to create something for only a few people? That is not a question that I can answer. Whatever the reason, this is a glorious vision for those who are willing to spend four hours watching ""Hamlet."" Everyone knows the story, so I will not spend much time on that. However, unlike other productions of the play, stage included, this is a completely uncut production, which has never been done before. According to some, Shakespeare never intended for the play to be produced uncut, leaving the decision of what to include to the director's discretion. That being said, I have no doubt that had he been able to see it, the Bard would have been overjoyed with Branagh's production.<br /><br />The film is top-heavy with film stars, although most have mere bit parts. All play their parts equally well. I would have thought Branagh too old to play the part of Hamlet, and while he still may be, his performance more than makes up for it. Hamlet is a complex part, displaying every emotion from grief to anger, happiness to madness, and everything in between. Branagh nailed it. Derek Jacobi is terrific as the wily Claudius, whose deception and treachery sets all these things in motion; his unique voice is perfect for the role. Julie Christie is also very good as Gertrude, Hamlet's caring mother who doesn't realize what is going on until late in the game.<br /><br />The classical actors are cast in bit parts (Judi Dench is on for all of 60 seconds and has no lines), but at least they're in it. Surprisingly, no one takes this to heart; everyone gives it their all, and it shows. Special mention has to go to Jack Lemmon and Billy Crystal, who are excellent. Robin Williams is a little too silly, but he's not bad (his part is pretty small anyway).<br /><br />Yet, this is undeniably Branagh's show. He adapted one of the most famous plays in history, and in so doing, he took on a whale of a project; it's impressive that he got it done, but the fact that the film is this good is a monumental achievement. What I really liked about this film is that you don't have to be a Shakespeare scholar to enjoy it. As most people know, Shakespeare is difficult to digest, but Branagh and his cast understand this. ""Hamlet"" is still immensely enjoyable to just sit and listen to the actors deliver the brilliant dialogue and excellent acting.<br /><br />This is a must see for anyone and everyone. It may be four hours long, but it's definitely worth it.",positive

The movie was a little more than two hours long, but it never dragged. It's hard to compare to the other movies of the MCU.

"OK, plain and simple, if you are a fan of the other Tomb Raider games (yes, even AOD) KEEP AWAY FROM LEGEND.<br /><br />It is, without doubt, the most disappointing TR game yet. It looks very nice, it sounds very nice, but it is totally unplayable and I've given up. I feel like I've been robbed by Eidos.<br /><br />It's very simple. TR was a PC game before anything else. You control Lara using the keyboard. In 6 Tomb Raider games the controls were standard. In AOD they were 'tacky', but still the same general control sequences. In Legend they have changed her movement and control methods completely and she is totally uncontrollable.<br /><br />I have seen comments elsewhere from people who say 'Use the mouse'. No, why should I? Others say 'Use a gamepad'. No, why should I? Others say 'But this has been the standard for 3rd person controls for years' Well, I don't care, it is not the standard for any other TR game so why mess with it. Oh, I know, because they couldn't care less about their original, loyal fan base, they want to cash in on the new kids who hadn't even heard of the series until the movies came out and make lots more money. Pathetic.<br /><br />My advice to any serious TR fan is keep away from this game, and if you do buy it complain to Eidos.

There are so many small ways this could have been improved, but nobody seemed to care. They concerned themselves more on the politics of this movie. That's why Wonder Woman and Alita were leagues better. This movie is just 'there'. It's supposed to be the introduction to a mighty female hero who will be vital in dealing with Thanos, but they somehow messed it up. disappointing, really.",negative
"Not that bad. Actually enjoyed it a little. Some of it was too cheezy but it was mostly fun cheezy that wasnt too tired. Brie is okay. Her acting really wasnt that bad. Some complain that she was too wooden or stoic at times... which is okay(ish) because it sort of fit the plot. Ill admit also that I was distracted by the politics and stuff surrounding what seemed like fairly racist or sexist remarks by her recently. Still I think that despite that, I was still able to enjoy her performance. She worked well with Nick Fury. Cool combo. She was basically boring though on her own... too... idk... something is missing but she might be able to improve for the next show. nI liked the feminist take on a super hero but alot of the dialogue and direction were wayyyy too on the nose and wound up feeling kind of regressive instead of positive. Well I am excited to see where this character goes... and if they can correct the misteps and capitalize on their successes. I could see it going either way though. IDK if this is just my inferring where I should not because of all of the drama around the movie, but I can kind of sense what might be some Kulture Kamp infused in the movie and its direction... some of it is cool and good and timely and refreshing and right... and some of it is reactionary and too far and hateful and fueled by resentment and hate. ***Possibly.

"It's hard to watch this movie without thinking forward to the television show it would become, especially if, like me, you happen to like the TV show more. But there's a lot to be said for the source.<br /><br />Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau) is a top New York City sportswriter who lives in an eight-room apartment by himself, a casualty of divorce and his own stubbornly sloppy mindset. Enter his friend Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon), needing a place to live after his wife threw him out for his stubbornly neatnik mindset. The result is a train wreck and one of the most beloved movie adaptations of a Neil Simon stage play.<br /><br />First thing's first: I love that apartment! Poker table, novelty dart board, askew photos of baseball players, empty booze and beer containers, even a pair of Roman columns. It's a place where men can be boys. Simon and director Gene Saks do a great job opening up the stage play's single set, Oscar's living room, by moving the action into the bedrooms and kitchen and giving the mounting tension between Oscar and Felix more corners to bounce off of.<br /><br />Neal Hefti's familiar score was heard on the TV show, but never so sweepingly orchestrated as it is here, in several different arrangements that make the on-screen action soar whenever its played. Real location work and night shots of Manhattan give the film an energy common to films shot in that place and time (""Buddwing,"" ""The World Of Henry Orient,"" ""Midnight Cowboy,"" ""Manchurian Candidate,"" ""Rosemary's Baby,"" etc.)<br /><br />Are Lemmon and Matthau too heavy in comparison to Tony Randall and Jack Klugman? To be fair, the movie is meant to be a more serious affair, dealing with the then-uncommon condition of mid-life divorce and the frustration inherent in not being able to make a relationship work. Simon has more in mind than entering Felix and Oscar in a game of ""Password"" or a battle of wits with Howard Cosell. But I don't know...<br /><br />Both Lemmon and Matthau were terrific comedians I enjoy watching especially in the middle of this film as I often do in their separate movies, but I never understood why they were regarded as a great comedy team. Here, in their best-regarded partnership, they seem to be acting in two different films; Lemmon in a comedy-drama and Matthau in a farce. Matthau is great in the beginning, charming us with his teddy-bear demeanor around the poker table, but near the end of the film he takes a turn much like Jack Torrance's in ""The Shining,"" reacting to Felix cleaning up his apartment and serving tasty food to his friends in a way that totally upsets the delicate balance of blame.<br /><br />While the ending bothers me, the part many see as the most jarring, the beginning, works fine as I see it. Watching Felix stumbling around trying to kill himself isn't great comedy, no, but it's a good way to get into a great comedy, setting us up with some real-life pain before bringing in the warmth and laughter. (Plus it has some great shots of the seedier parts of the city.) In the middle of the movie, this scene would have been a miscalculation, but it works as a way of establishing Felix's torment and a sense of sharp relief to come when we see Oscar and his poker friends bicker and feud.<br /><br />That's where Simon's lines are so great. They are the underlying strength of the film. He gets the banter exactly right and real, and still makes it funny. ""I don't mind you talking, Felix. You got things to say. What's scaring me is I'm beginning to listen."" The TV show showed how wrong it is to assume the movie is always better, in fact the TV show once made a good point about ""assuming"" anything at all, but the movie makes for a solid foundation and is a joy in its own right.",positive

"Interesting topic. Pathetic delivery - script and direction. <br /><br />Our hero, Miles, thaws out and has his emergency world-first life restoration surgery. This is where the fun begins. The underlying issue is that Miles has NO SOUL!!! This is used to explain his quasi-erratic behaviour of being indirectly responsible for two deaths (I believe this to be the total number of deaths in 104 minutes). <br /><br />On the livlier side, Miles prefers the odd glass of brandy, blazing fireplaces and his young, maturing female cousin. The finale does indeed do justice to this film.<br /><br />Some thoughts: 1. Producer $$$ were parted with to create this tripe. J.D. Feigelson was the script writer and a (or sole) producer. Looks like he did not learn a lesson on ""how not to bring an interesting idea to life"" when one views his other writing credits. This will support the credibility of this script.<br /><br />2. Now available on DVD!!! This IS truly scary. Should be forever ""Bottom of the Shelf"" in VHS format.<br /><br />3. A re-incarnated human without a soul will default to an evil entity. <br /><br />4. The score offers minimal support. Not even an in-form Jerry Goldsmith could save it.<br /><br />5. Deserved the 0230 time slot on TV and a touch more entertaining than the infomercials + test patterns it was competing against at the time of my viewing.<br /><br />6. Thankfully did not spawn any sequels ala Wes Craven's ""Nightmare"" franchise. Chiller Too: The Return Return of Miles, or something like that.<br /><br />Despite my rating of 1, I still recommend this movie as a great example of how to kill an acting or script-writing career. This should apply to directing, however Wes Craven will eternally be exempt due to his sole good piece of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" 1984.",negative

"Honore De Balzac's genuinely bizarre short story on which this was loosely based gets an unsettling, albeit breathtakingly filmed, treatment here as a sort of forbidden-love blossoms over a period of time between man and beast in the early part of the nineteenth century. Thin and very blonde English actor Ben Daniels plays the role of a young soldier during the Napoleonic wars who gets lost whilst escorting an exiled(?) french painter across the rugged, dangerous landscapes of the Gobi Desert. After literally going around in circles the two men give up ever trying to reach civilization again, thus each decides (against better judgment mind you) to go their separate ways with the promise of both returning to the same exact spot when and if a water source is actually found. This is of course how Daniels' character comes to encounter the creature (a wild and untamed female leopard) and eventually form a seemingly unbreakable bond, or rather love, with it that both saves his life and nearly destroys it by film's end. The exquisite cinematography, minimalist dialog, somewhat demented story which arguably hints at possible bestiality in about three scenes are what ultimately lead professional critics to pan the film as pretentious and overlong rubbish. While it is a film that isn't exactly for all tastes mind you, I find it to be a subtle, though decidedly left-of-center mixture of fantasy with a surreal and sumptuous atmosphere, highlighted by the fact that for more than half of the flick actor Ben Daniels is forced to perform opposite a wild animal (four leopards were actually used as opposed to just the one), which plain common sense and a slight knowledge of theatrics dictates that it must have been a maddening and very difficult job that he managed to pull off quite brilliantly if you ask me! Overall, I think that ""Passion in the Desert"" takes a while to warm up to, but if you're a patient person who is willing to give it some time it does in fact cast it's uniquely original spell over you in spite of everything; and unlike most platonic human and animal relationship stories it need not require a talking pig, monkey or shaggy dog to keep your interest throughout.

"Robert Altman shouldn't make a movie like this, but the fact that he did- and that it turns out to be a reasonably good and tightly-wound thriller in that paperback-tradition of Grisham thrillers- shows a versatility that is commendable. In the Gingerbread Man he actually has to work with something that, unfortunately, he isn't always very successful at, or at least it's not the first thing on his checklist as director: plot. There's one of those big, juicy almost pot-boiler plots where a sleazy lawyer gets caught up with a desperate low-class woman and then a nefarious figure whom the woman is related with enters their lives in the most staggering ways, twists and plot ensues, yada yada. And it's surprising that Altman would really want to take on one of these ""I saw that coming from back there!"" endings, or just a such a semi-conventional thriller.<br /><br />But it's a surprise that pays off because, oddly enough, Altman is able to catch some of that very fine behavior, or rather is able to unintentionally coax it out of a very well-cast ensemble, of a small-town Georgian environment. The film drips with atmosphere (if not total superlative craftsmanship, sometimes it's good and sometimes just decent for Altman), as Savannah is possibly going to be hit by a big hurricane and the swamp and marshes and rain keep things soaked and muggy and humid. So the atmosphere is really potent, but so are performances from (sometimes) hysterical Kenneth Branaugh, Embeth Davitz as the 'woman' who lawyer Branaugh gets caught up with, and Robert Downey Jr (when is he *not* good?) as the private detective in Branaugh's employ. Did I neglect Robert Duvall, who in just five minutes of screen time makes such an indelible impression to hang the bad-vibes of the picture on? <br /><br />As said, some of the plot is a little weak, or just kind of standard (lawyer is divorced, bitter custody battle looms, innocent and goofy kids), but at the same time I think Altman saw something captivating in the material, something darker than some of the other Grisham works that has this standing out somehow. If it's not entirely masterful, it still works on its limited terms as a what-will-happen-next mystery-Southern-noir.",positive
Wonder-Ful Woman. This film is the different from any other marvel movie. From the first act where we enter into this extremely cool special ops field. Carol Danvers is the most believable that we've seen her as she trains with her teacher (Jude law) Carol Danvers crash lands on planet 52 (earth) where she runs into nick fury played by Samuel L Jackson. From there  we see a joining of a really cool buddy's cop flick. Nick fury and Brie Larson are joined together in defeating the skrulls or so we Thought. It turns out there is  a plot twist and as Carol Danvers discovers her true identity she recognizes that she has been lied to the entire time. Ok so the cast is phenomenal outside of the few awkward lines that are given to Brie Larson every scene is breathtaking and fresh. You can not go wrong with a younger nick fury. And of course the cat is wonderfully adorable This film. Overall good movie.,positive

"A story about a female bullied by males throughout her life, and ultimately fighting against an evil government in order to save illegal aliens from extinction.  Given the current state of politics in the US, this movie is definitely a propaganda film straight out of California.  If I ignored both the direct and metaphoric analogies about politics scattered about this film, there would be nothing to review except for the end-credits scene, which seems to be a random scene thrown in last-minute from The upcoming Avengers: Endgame film.  All-in-all, this film is a great example of forcing down a political view down an audience's throat.",controversial
The main character and hero is hard to relate to as she is perfect at everything when she first tries it.

"This film stars, among others, ""SlapChop"" Vince Offer (who also wrote, edited and directed) and Joey Buttafuoco--not exactly names that scream out ""quality"". And with such uplifting skits as ""Supermodels taking a dump"" (it's exactly what it sounds like), a guy who robs a sperm bank (the ""Rhymer""), necrophilia with a rotting corpse, black market fetuses (featuring a guy scooping what are supposed to be them out of a jar), lots and lots of gay jokes, a skit about a giant phallus who is a superhero and forced abortions. The skits are painfully unfunny (such as ""Batman and Rhymer""), the acting not good enough to be considered amateurish and the film is crude just for the sake of being crude...and stupid. I truly believe a group of 8 year-olds could have EASILY made a funnier film with the same budget.<br /><br />Apparently this film resulted in a lawsuit by ""Slap Shot"" Vince against the Scientologists. Frankly, I wouldn't know who to root for in this case!!! Apparently, he alleged that somehow Scientologists destroyed his reputation and sank this film. No matter that the film is repellent junk from start to finish and 99% unfunny (by comparison, Ebola is funnier)...and these are the nicest things I can say about the movie.<br /><br />By the way, that IS Bobby Lee (from ""Mad TV"") wearing a diaper and participating in the dumb fake porno film.

"Captain marvel did not disappoint me. That said, I had very low expectations. This movie overall felt like it was one of the more average entries in the MCU. It was a sub-par experience and I feel like it's a one time watch for what it was. Would I recommend this? Well, I'd say if you want to just have a night out where you can turn your brain off, then this is a good choice. But let me just say that Samuel L Jackson was really good in this movie. The chemistry Brie Larson and Samuel L Jackson had was very refreshing, and I personally wish the entire movie was like that, because it soon stops. For the most part, Brie Larson did not feel like she fit the role of captain marvel. Now before you go on and hate me for saying that, I don't necessarily think it's her fault. The script made her feel bland and boring, and I feel with a better script she would fit the role perfectly. Who knows, I'm sure the Russo brothers could write her way better.

"Forget the fact that the movie is boring. Forget the bad acting and that a cat acted better the Brie larson. Forget all the retcons in the MCEU alone and all the other dumb stuff that occured in this movie. The entire reason this movie deserves a half star is because of what they did to Monica Rambeau. How dare you claim this movie is about female empowerment and diversity and all that and you do what you did to this character. Monica Rambeau was the second Captain Marvel in the series continuity after Captain Mar-vel (who was also a man but not really important i guess but he wasnt a scientist as in the movie, he was captain freakin marvel and was a warrior.) These fools degraded her into a side character that looks up to carol instead of leading her as a veteran Captain Marvel. DOnt you dare say youre all about female empowerment and diversity and all that and then do some heinous stuff like this. Heck, Carol used to be Ms. Marvel, not even Captain Marvel. She only 5 years ago picked up that mantle of Captain Marvel and none of that was even mentioned at all as if she just started off as Captain Marvel.",negative

Goose in particular managed to display a broader acting range than Brie Larson.

"The excruciatingly slow pace of this film was probably the director's express intention, in order to convey what life was like growing up as a village teen in China. However, I found the combination of the glacially slow 'plot' and the general filming style so impersonal as to be totally alienating, particularly to a western audience. At times I actually had trouble telling some characters apart, as they were filmed from such a distance. Two hours in and I was totally past caring. As someone who is not only interested in music but is also very into the history and culture of China (and is by the way no stranger to Chinese cinema), I couldn't engage with a single character and found nothing to get my teeth into. It begs the question: If I disliked it, who on earth would like it? Give me Zhang Yimou, give me Chen Kaige. Give me the work of just about any other Chinese director I've ever seen. This sorry effort just doesn't measure up at all. I'd be sorry to see Chinese cinema judged against this benchmark.",negative

"I bought Jack-O a number of months ago at a Blockbuster video sale, and at the time I wasn't expecting anything outstanding from it. Upon watching it, I realized I not only got less than I could have ever bargained for, but a whole lot more as well. It seems, strange, I know. And it is. But it's perfectly fitting when you consider that the utter weirdness that is ""Jack-O""<br /><br />The movie follows a young boy named Shawn Kelly. Somehow, thru ancestral ties, he is marked for death at the hands of a demented, scythe wielding Pumpkin man. This pumpkin man was killed by Shawn's Great-grandfather-uncle-cousin-etc, and now that the villain has been resurrected, Shawn's death is apparently crucial to his hell-bred mission of vengeance. Anyway, much ""horror"" ensues as Jack-O hacks his way thru various neighbors before battling Shawn to the finish.<br /><br />I'm not so much here to discuss the plot as I am to determine who may find any worth in this movie. I can honestly tell you that Jack-O is one of the most poorly made movies in the history of time. The acting is deadpan (except when it should be), the script is apparently a 1st grade group project, and the production budget must not have exceeded $150. Some of the most laughable death scenes are carried out in this anti-thriller, and they're all the more humorous when you realize director Steve Latshaw actually seems serious in his movie-making.<br /><br />And yet I heartily enjoyed the film. I can call it a terrible horror movie, yes. But I can also say I had a great time watching it with my friends, and have watched it several times since that fateful first viewing. Many people (including some of my friends) will find this movie intolerable and needlessly time-consuming, and that's understandable. If you're like me and enjoy ridiculously bad horror movies that take themselves seriously, you'll find Jack-O an instant classic, which is also understandable.<br /><br />That's why it's so hard to rate this movie. If I were rating Jack-O's quality as a film, I wouldn't give it anything. In fact, the studio would owe me stars. Yet if I were rating it's on the basis of pure enjoyment, I'd give it an 8 or a 9. I'll give it a 4, so to be somewhere in the middle. I recommend everyone go out, rent this, and form their own conclusion.",negative

Carol Denvers doesn't really do anything to amaze or inspire us or make us fall in love with the character.nHumor from the lead character seems forced and unnatural, because she seems bored most of the time, Carol Denvers is not a really funny character. Samuel L Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn and Jude Law were the best parts of the film since, the lead character didn't have much to do and they do try in every way to save the movie.nThe whole movie seems to be based on convenient plot twists. If something happens it is because the plot demands it so.nFrom technical standpoint, bad lighting, bad color palette choices (especially during the train fight scene), mediocre CGI and fight scenes really leaves much to be desired.nIn a nutshell, the movie has nothing really new to offer and really just seems like a passtime and a lazy attempt to introduce the Captain Marvel character while we wait for Avengers Endgame.",negative
"As a woman, I was initially excited for this movie. nBut then I saw it...nThe story overall falls very flat. Carol Danvers is marketed heavily as a ""strong female character"" but she is anything but. nThis movie taught me that in order to be a strong female, you cannot carry any weaknesses. nTo be a strong female, you cannot have any flaws. nAnd finally, to be a strong female, you must dominate over men. nCarol Danvers had no heart. No weaknesses. No flaws. And her only conflict was to dominate over men (Which she somehow achieved very easily).nIf she had been more affected by her misunderstanding with the Skrulls, if she have felt even an ounce of guilt for killing the Skrulls in the past, then I might have been able to resonate with her. But she breezes past this revelation like it is nothing. Because the film wanted to keep the underlying agenda that women do not have flaws and do not have anything to feel guilty about. nConclusion: Captain Marvel is not a strong female character.nA strong female character is a woman that has flaws but manages to triumph over them anyways.",controversial

What I find most interesting about them all is for better and worse, my opinion of them rarely changes; that is to say unlike a richer drama or biopic etc, my enjoyment of Marvel blockbusters never depends on what state of mind I'm in or who I'm with; They're perfectly the same to me no matter what. Some other movies that I truly and completely love, I re-watch sometimes and think they're utter embarrassing rubbish, then next time, I love it again.

But Marvel movies, on the whole, as they've refined the formula over and over again, are the fast food of movies; I'm never disappointed and never overly satiated; I know what to expect and there's a nice warm familiarity with that, but I'm never challenged.nI think that's ok in movie making, but you can't have takeaway every day! So I really like the marvel movies for exactly what they are, I enjoy analysing them but only to compare them to each other, not to actual movies.nnSo with that in mind, Captain Marvel is was good. Not better than say an Ant-Man and The Wasp, but just as good in a different way. It was a lot more chilled out. Specifically, it wasn't trying too hard, trying to make you laugh every second to avoid you thinking about how little sense it all makes. And it wasn't trying to display this global threat of annihilation in a way that we can't at all relate to, and essentially, it wasn't trying to be really tense all the time, like some blockbusters that try to twist you up tighter for 100 minutes and not let go. Captain Marvel marched to the beat of its own drum, which actually, tied nicely into the plot. It was solid and fun and relaxed. Which is a change of pace.nnLike Brie Larson's Carol Dan(Vers), there's a pervading chill to this flick, a simplicity, and not a hyperactivity. That doesn't mean there isn't a nice smattering of action, even if the third act is all CGI grimaces and smashy DC nonsense. The plot is not at all surprising but it's not cloying and it's unafraid of slowing down here and there.nnI know I said it wasn't trying to be funny, but that doesn't mean that it isn't. Yes there's clear and unforced chemistry between Jackson and Larson and there's a cool 90's Lethal Weapon/X-Files/Superman vibe to the film (and the music). But the standout was Ben Mendelsohn who is usually criminally underutilised or edited down, but here he shines. nnMendelsohn's Talos wasn't the only thing that had a welcome lost 90's flavour of Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Angel; I couldn't help but think that I would gladly take a Netflix mini series reboot of Buffy with Boden/Fleck and Brie Larson on the team. nnSo there's a lovely Deus Ex cat, a cameo that is maybe the greatest conceived cameo of all time, an opening logo crawl that almost brought tears to my eyes, a subtle but solid throwback soundtrack and an end fight scene that felt like a joyous celebration of a woman's strength, with a light touch, an important message and an energy and exuberance that felt right.nnCaptain Marvel is not overbearing and it's not rubbish. Yeah, it'll be good after a hard days work. And after all, that's what these movies are for. And I liked it more than Black Panther. There, I said it.",positive
"It wasn't good but it wasn't terrible. I would put it close to the bottom of the MCU; above iron man 3 and Thor Dark World but below Iron Man 2 and ant-man. Overall the plot was dull and bogged down by expository dialogue. All of the supporting characters were great except for the girl. The real problem is Brie Larson's abysmal acting. She was like a lump of rock suffering from severe autism. Her wooden performance dragged the whole film down. The movie is largely carried by the strength of the MCU universe and the excellent â€śbad-guysâ€ť. Without spoiling, all I can say is that these might be the best villains of the MCU after Thanos. Villains have always been the weak area of the MCU so at least that was a step forward in this film.",negative
"Although I generally do not like remakes believing that remakes are waste of time; this film is an exception. I didn't actually know so far until reading the previous comment that this was a remake, so my opinion is purely about the actual film and not a comparison.<br /><br />The story and the way it is written is no question: it is Capote. There is no need for more words.<br /><br />The play of Anthony Edwards and Eric Roberts is superb. I have seen some movies with them, each in one or the other. I was certain that they are good actors and in case of Eric I always wondered why his sister is the number 1 famous star and not her brother. This time this certainty is raised to fact, no question. His play, just as well as the play of Mr. Edwards is clearly the top of all their profession.<br /><br />I recommend this film to be on your top 50 films to see and keep on your DVD shelves.",positive

"Worst film ever, this is a statement that people here on IMDb often throw around. Whether it's an Uwe Boll movie, bad classics like Manos The Hands Of Fate or the latest no brains summer action fest from Michael Bay, people are often quick to jump to the sudden conclusion that on the board they're posting that there is nothing worse in the movie world.<br /><br />I envy these people, because they're blissfully ignorant and unaware of how deep the rabbit hole of crap movie making really goes. There are films out there so bad, so hideous, so unintentionally hilarious and so ridiculous that cults form around them to celebrate their awfulness and their discussion boards are the kindest places on the internet due to everyone agreeing unanimously that said film is really that bad.<br /><br />Ladies and Gentlemen, i present to you Ben and Arthur, an 85 minute gay epic that is so utterly bad that it's a lot like a violent car crash, you know it's awful but you can't stop looking at it. The brainchild of self proclaimed ""hollywood actor, director"" and may i add beached whale Sam Mraovich, this film is legendarily terrible. Let me give you a hint of how ego driven this project was. Mr Mraovich not only directed this film, he wrote it, produced it, executive produced it, scored it, edited it and then finally starred in it. This is a man so blinded by his own ego and so believing of his non existent genius that like someone with an ugly child he fails to recognise just how catastrophic his bastard creation really is.<br /><br />Everything in this film fails on an epic level, the acting is the worst you will ever witness, the plot is the most ridiculous, the editing and cinematography is the most amateur and even the music is like nails on a chalkboard. I'm aware i've gone on a bit of a tangent here, but please believe me that this film is really as bad as i describe it, i would say this film is horse crap squished into a film reel, but the truth is it wasn't even shot on film, it was shot on a digital camcorder not much better than the one sitting in your closet right now gathering dust. Don't get me wrong, i forgive low budgets for films provided the concept is interesting, for example as much as i disliked it The Blair Witch Project proved that low budgets can still lead to an atmospheric interesting film. Ben and Arthur does not have a good concept to fall back on, even if this film was shot on a budget of 20 million with Hollywoods finest actors it would still suck, the plot is that atrocious, and the characters are even worse. One of the main characters Arthur who is portrayed by non other than Sam Mraovich is one of the most whiny loathsome little turds ever put in a film. You'll dislike him within 5 minutes of the start of the film and by the end of the film that hate will have turned into outright loathing. Apparently Mr Mraovich forgot that we're supposed to root for the hero.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil all the gut busting hilarity you'll experience watching this film (which i urge you not to pay for) so i will give you two tame mild examples of how stupid this film is, tame and mild as in amongst the least offending mistakes in the movie. In one cut we hear one of the main characters say how ""they know a good lawyer and will give HIM a call"" the shot fades out then fades back in and this HIM they spoke of earlier is actually a woman, quite a spectacular mistake to make in post production i think. The second is simple, seconds after seeing this transsexual lawyer the characters are told to fly to Vermont, we then cut to a shot of a plane landing amongst palm trees in a sunny area. I've never been to Vermont personally but i'm certain you won't find any palm trees there.<br /><br />Imagine this kind of stupid amateur inconsistency stretched to nearly an hour and a half combined with ridiculous dialogue and plot and then multiply it by 10 and it still won't fully prepare you for Ben and Arthur. Imagine the absolute worst film you've seen in your life and imagine it being even worse and you still won't be on the same level as Ben and Arthur, this film is really that bad.<br /><br />However we should be glad in a way, films like this are a true rarity. They give us hope that one day we can become film makers ourselves or that we can be screenwriters. Simply because we'll have a new found sense of confidence due to the fact that we'll know that nothing we produce no matter how amateur could be as much of a suck fest as this.<br /><br />The real worst movie of all time has finally been discovered, and it is called Ben and Arthur.",negative

"I became a fan of the TV series `Homicide: Life on the Street' late in the show's run, but became a fan very quickly. It was a cop show unlike any other: visually different in its use of hand-held cameras, taking the viewer everywhere, with its multiethnic and mutiracial cast and their varying and fascinating personalities, and that it covered all of the good and bad of a police department, including the corruption and personality clashes that bubble up to the surface. <br /><br />Homicide: The Movie, the reunion follow-up to the series, is as good as a made-for-television film can be. After Lt. Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now a candidate for mayor of Baltimore, is shot, the series' cast members are back to help find the killer. In addition, the cast members who left the force and those who died, also manage to have their place in the film.

"It's a good superhero movie, though pretty much by the numbers. Nothing special, but entertaining. I'd say it's along the lines of the first Cap and Thor movies. And I do feel Larson is on the same place Evans was back then, with a character that has potential but doesn't feel as compelling as it can be. It has a nice flow and rhythm, as well as interesting twists and fun action sequences. It could've played up some of the nice concepts and ideas lying under the mythos of the story (immigration or repercussions from blind obedience in times of war) instead of going all in with the feminist stand and only the feminist stand. But contrary to popular belief, it doesn't feel like pandering either. Sadly, every supporting role is far more attention-grabbing and fleshed out than the lead (Samuel L. Jackson, Lashana Lynch, Ben Medelsohn and Anette Bening all do an amazing job, whereas Brie Larson only truly shines in quieter more dramatic scenes). But since the story still plays well, you can't take that away from the movie as a whole. The third act does have the problem most Marvel movies share, where stakes are diluted as the hero seems to be having fun instead of struggling to succeed.",controversial
"Captain Marvel is an average MCU film. While it is serviceable as a way to pass the time until Endgame, it does little to pull you into a character who is supposed to be the most powerful hero in the MCU. The plot itself is interesting in a ""don't think about it too hard"" kind of way and is extremely forgettable. nnNow, the way this movie handles the bigger universe it is a part of is HORRENDOUS! So many interesting MCU plot points, like Fury's lost eye, are either subverted or flat out retconned for the sake of gags and bad jokes. The movie itself is a high C if the plot is taken for what it is, but do yourself a favor and try not to think about how many small nuggets of the MCU are trashed. It pains me.nnTLDR: Captain Marvel is a pretty average movie that would probably flop if it wasn't for the Marvel logo.

"Nynke is a classy filmed movie in the same style as the Oscar winning film Character (1997). But this comparison immediately urges me to add that the latter was quite more exciting...<br /><br />Sure, Nynke is a beautiful historic & costume drama (with fantastic acting by Monic Hendrickx!) in which you witness the personal growth of 'Nynke van Hichtum' in her marriage to Pieter Jelles Troelstra. The subtitle of this movie is 'a lovestory'. So it starts, and ends with their marriage. <br /><br />But THAT is where the director makes a crucial mistake! Nynke's exciting, independent life started when the marriage ended. She wrote several children's books and travelled around the world. What a great life she has lived. But Pieter Verhoeff puts Nynke back in the trammels of convention that depressed her and that she struggled out of: the thought that her life extended just her marriage to Troelstra, being no one else but the mother of their kids.<br /><br />Let's all hope for Nynke II!",positive

The kid that dies I guess was suppose to make us cry...but for some reason it just irritated everyone. Then we have to listen to line after line of sappy dialog that tried desperately to mimic ""Wuthering Heights"", which of course was also quoted in the movie. Go figure. There was nothing original about the movie at all, it was like sitting through the most mundane parts of every war movie ever made, with a little bit of humor thrown in to keep you hoping that it was going to get better.

Way to  devote precious screentime to focus on people that you insist are losers who couldn't get under your skin no matter what.nnIt's a shame, because I actually very much enjoy the character of Carol Danvers, but she isn't well-represented in this film. nnThe cinematography isn't nearly as good as in movies like Ant-Man or Black Panther, the soundtrack is sub-par, the fight choreography feels like every enemy is just half-heartedly throwing a punch or two while they patiently wait for Larson to obliterate them, the pacing is awful, they throw away a potential impactful character moment by having Fury's eye lost in such a stupid way...nnLarson's character has no weakness, so we aren't invested when she succeeds in anything, even less so than other heroes in movies. She never grows as a person, her actions just change on a dime. She doesn't go off to save the universe because she feels like it's her duty to, or because she sees that every life matters, or even because she wants to destroy anything that would cause great harm!nShe does things in this movie because the screenwriters demanded it. I cannot sympathize with an emotionally-absent Goddess who trumps even the most powerful MCU characters without anything more than a raised eyebrow. The DCU has the same problem with Superman, which is why I'm disappointed that Marvel couldn't see the issue. nnLet's have female characters for our daughters to look up to, I'm all for that! Let's have them look up to Natasha Romanoff or Gamora, women who have done wrong in the past and feel absolutely awful about it but had to work towards expressing their emotions in a healthy way instead of repressing them.nLet's have them look up to Shuri, a genius in every regard who doesn't let that stop her from forging a loving natural relationship with her family. Who doesn't let that stop her from just being a kid without having to take up a stiff mature mantle.nLet's have them look up to Peggy Carter, who founded SHIELD to bring the Avengers together in the first place.nLet's have them look up to Valkyrie, Storm, Wasp, Pepper Potts, Mantis, Nebula, Rogue!nnBut Captain Marvel has nothing young girls even COULD look up to, let alone anything they should.",controversial

"I think it was an overrated PG-13 crap! At least BRITTANY SNOW's performance was good and some others like IDRIS ELBA were good too, but some others teens in the prom like the leads friends were not that convincing. The killer was so dumb and looked so stupid too. The deaths were stupid, boring and completely unoriginals. The movie was very boring too and very overrated. It wasn't suspenseful at all, i almost fall asleep. Its another bad PG-13 remake, its really a dreadful movie IMO. The ending was so stupid and the climax was very rushed and boring. The movie is pretty slow too.

Well thats just my opinion. i gave it a 2/10.",negative
"While not a bad movie, it was massively disappointing.  Despite changes to her origin and sadly other characters in the MCU, the real problem is that the directors clearly have no idea who Carol Danvers is.  Brie Larson did a decent job with what she was given, but that was not the Carol I know and love from the comics.  I am holding out hope that the Russos flesh her out the way they did with Spidey.  They have always understood him better than the director of Homecoming.  I adored Wonder Woman, and this was no Wonder Woman.  Carol can be an amazing character, but in this movie she went from amnesiac to fighting paper enemies.  There was zero tension in the third act, it was akin to watching superman beat up humans.  He was never in jeopardy, and as cool as her powers looked on screen, there was never a moment of joy as she overcame overwhelming odds.  I am going to see this again with tempered expectations to see if it improves my review, but for now, it is just disappointing akin to Thor 2 and Iron Man 3",negative

I wish there was more development for the character rather than just making her super powerful beyond imagination right away. Villains were a weak part of the film. Making the fight scenes seem super one sided. One thing that really bother me about the movie was where the Tesseract was.(We know where it is in 1940s after the Cpt. America movie) So it makes no sense where the Tesseract ended up in this film. Cpt. Marvel herself felt very stiff through out the movie. Not sure if it was written out that way or was it the actress's acting ability but whatever the reason. It felt odd at times, whether it was funny moment or a serious one it just didnt seem to work. Over all, the film wasnt over the top good or super bad. It kind of just fell into the lower middle for me.",controversial

Didn't they discover it WITH Cap?"".nnI know that there is an explaination, but that's just how I felt when I saw that forsaken blue cube popping up again.nn(Also when Captain Marvel broke free of the control and started glowing, I could not stop imagining Vegeta saying ""She has risen beyond, into the realm if legend!

"I had to watch this film because the plot was so outrageous and the film lived up to expectations. In fact it makes for quite uncomfortable viewing at times. Unlike other Meyer films, the sexual antics are down to a minimum. Some of the scenes of violence are unnecessarily gratuitous and offensive. The plot is chaotic and some of the acting and lines are dreadful.<br /><br />The film is a strange combination of sado-masochistic fantasy combined with a window of the brutality and immorality of the slavery and fails on all counts. It's as though Meyer was trying to make up for the sexploitation/ blackploitation by having a higher moral message. Meyer knows we feel a bit guilty about getting turned on by the blatant dominatrix connotations of the early scene showing Lady Susan wielding a whip in a provocative outfit. He then tries to steer back to the righteous path by turning it into a film about the triumph of good over evil. However, because they cancel each other out, you end up with nothing.<br /><br />Because it so bad in so many ways, it is actually worth watching if you appreciate the art of making an awful film in the worst possible taste. Perhaps, because it is so bad, we almost let Meyer get away with the unacceptable.",negative

The witch character is not very good. The family acts like it is no big deal that these odd things are happening.

"It was ok, which really isn't enough for movies anymore.nnThe character of Danvers really didn't seem to emote at appropriate times, which is fine when you are trying to make a character you can project yourself onto, but it is very distracting to have such an animated cast of characters with your lead being about as charismatic as dry corn flakes.nnThe character arc doesn't seem to go anywhere either, with her being, essentially, the same character at the start and finish of the movie. These sorts of static characters aren't really bad, per say, there is a setting and story for them to exist in, and this was not it. It was less a story about someone rising up above her peers, standing for what is right, and making great sacrifices in the name of justice (you know, like a super hero), and more like a guided tour.nnSpeaking of the story, there seemed to be some unusual edits that may have contributed to the disjointed flow of the plot. It feels as though these removed scenes might have held some of the things I was looking for to turn this character arc into just that: an arc, as opposed to a straight line. Maybe it spent some more time with some other characters to really build a connection, so we aren't left with the whiplash of ""Wait, who are you again?"" It also appears that some continuity errors might also have had solutions laying about somewhere on the cutting room floor.nnAs is typical for modern Marvel movies, the effects are stunning. Like Doctor Strange, it is pleasing to look at but not think to hard about. Easily this was the best part of the movie and it's saving grace from the average, if not less than, plot.nnUnfortunately, where Marvel wanted to make a female superhero movie, they failed to include the part where their lead hero could be challenged. Even in Wonder Woman, a title which Captain Marvel was competing with in the ""Female Super Heroine"" genre, they were able to maintain Diana's physical superiority, but the things she's seen and the truths revealed to her made her an entirely different person. In Carol's case, it would appear that they were too afraid to put her into any form of compromising position, much like Rey from The Force Awakens, and I'm sure we see where Star Wars is sitting right now, with the canned EA title and scrapped Boba Fett Movie.nnAs stated above, it was a passable movie, but that just isn't enough and is entirely unacceptable from Disney and Marvel Studios. Give it a watch if you want to see neat plasma effects, but if it is a story and compelling character development you are looking for, Wonder Woman, Alita, even Train Your Dragon 3 has this one beat.",negative

Nevertheless, it's still worthy entertainment. The acting divas are fine and the production values are terrific. A music score by David Raskin, cinematography by Lucien Ballard and Oscar-nominated costumes contribute mightily. With this, A PLACE IN THE SUN and LOLITA to her credit, does anyone do crazy as well as Winters? Directed by Curtis Harrington, a master at this type of not quite A-movie exploitation.

"I read that Jessie Matthews was approached and turned down co-starring with Fred Astaire in Damsel in Distress. Jessie Matthews in her prime never left her side of the pond to do any American musical films. IF they had teamed for this film it would have been a once in a lifetime event.<br /><br />It's a pity because Damsel in Distress has everything else going for it. Fred Astaire, story and adapted to screen by author P.G. Wodehouse, Burns&Allen for comedy, and songs by the Gershwin Brothers. In answer to the question posed by the Nice Work If You Can Get It, there isn't much you could ask more for this film.<br /><br />Except a leading lady. Though Ginger Rogers made several films away from Fred Astaire, Damsel in Distress is the only film Astaire made without Rogers while they were a team. Young Joan Fontaine was cast in this opposite Astaire.<br /><br />Her character has none of the bite that Ginger Rogers's parts do in these films. All she basically has to do is act sweet and demure. She also doesn't contribute anything musically. And if I had to rate all the dancing partners of Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine would come out at the bottom. The poor woman is just horrible in the Things Are Looking Up number. <br /><br />When she co-starred later on in a musical with Bing Crosby, The Emperor Waltz, it's no accident that Fontaine is given nothing musical to do.<br /><br />The version I have is a colorized one and in this case I think it actually did some good. The idyllic lush green English countryside of P.G. Wodehouse is really brought out in this VHS copy. Especially in that number I mentioned before with Astaire and Fontaine which does take place in the garden.<br /><br />Burns&Allen on the other hand as a couple of old vaudeville troopers complement Astaire in grand style in the Stiff Upper Lip number. The surreal fun-house sequence is marvelously staged.<br /><br />P.G. Wodehouse's aristocracy runs the gamut with Constance Collier at her haughty best and for once Montagu Love as Fontaine's father as a nice man on film.<br /><br />The biggest hit out of A Damsel in Distress is A Foggy Day maybe the best known song about the British capital city since London Bridge Is Falling Down. Done in the best simple elegant manner by Fred Astaire, it's one of those songs that will endure as long as London endures and even after.<br /><br />Overlooking the young and inexperienced Joan Fontaine, A Damsel in Distress rates as a classic, classic score, classic dancing, classic comedy.

"Sometimes I rest my head and think about the reasons why movies about killer sharks and/or crocodiles are still getting made these days. They've been making these lame ""Jaws""-copies since the 70s, it's not like they're getting any more well-liked. The idea is still exactly the same. So we have an animal that starts murdering people. First it takes down some secondary characters, then it starts attacking the main characters, usually played by a couple of nobodies except for someone who used to be a bit more famous, who usually plays a specialist. One of the main characters usually dies before the others kill the animal somehow, usually with an explosion. Then, we usually get a last shot where we see that the animal is still alive, or has laid eggs, etc. etc. ""Krocodylus"" basically uses the same overused ideas, and does absolutely nothing to create even a tad bit of variation. Unless you count the fact that the ""specialist"" is a captain in this one variation, in that case your standards are pretty low.

A beautiful score from Badalamenti, exquisite photography of rural life (love those aerial corn-field shots), and a sly director's hand that reveals man's basic humanity, this is a beautiful slice of life film. Its extremely slow pace may lull some viewers to sleep, but those who stay for along for the ride will be well rewarded in the end.",positive
"Captain Marvel is the 21st movie of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It starred Brie Larson as Carol Danvers/Vers/Captain Marvel, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Jude Law as Yon-Rogg and more casts.n The story started in 1995 on the Kree Empire's capital planet of Hala, Vers had nightmares. To be honest, it wasn't a good beginning but it wasn't forgettable. Next scenes were quite forgettable because they showed nothing special so I couldn't remember much of it. I could remember when she met Fury with 2 agents at the Blockbuster Video shop (wasn't it? I can't remember). When she was captured by Talos and other Skrulls, we were fooled by the movie (we though the Skrulls were villains). They tried to change Vers' memory (surely that could be remembered by most people, I think). The others scene till the end of the movie was not bad but a few people could remember many. The story plot was not bad at all. Started in a planet, a young woman trying to find out who she was and took a lot of risks to restore her memory, surely audiences from the 90s would like that but for me, it was medium like a 7.5/-. Bet the 90s would like it more than I do.n Brie Larson was set to be the main character in this movie. But unfortunately, she didn't try her best to prove that Carol Danvers (or Vers) was main in here. I know she could do a lot better like in Room (2015), she won Best Actress. But in here, the MCU didn't take this movie seriously enough to make Carol the main character. However, they did some marvelous CGI effects of Vers' powers and others. They were quite like real with no mistakes. The final battle was thrilling, full with power beams and other CGI, nothing was bad and I was actually impressed. The right thing they did was to add humor to the movie. Luckily, there was Samuel L. Jackson, so things went okay! (also with Goose the 'cat') Even though there were hilarious scenes, I laughed a little and I think they should do more. While watching the movie, I was bored for some time like in conversations, for example. They were really boring but to make things impressive, they did a lot better at the end even though the fight scenes weren't that epic. nSo to summarize this, I would like to say that Captain Marvel (2019) isn't one of the greatest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it was funny, entertaining (at the end) but I bet the audiences of the 21st century wouldn't like it. Sorry Larson, the movie was fine but you didn't try your best in here!",negative

"This representation of the popular children's story on film is pretty pathetic to watch. I know it is one of the earliest efforts at moviemaking, but this 15-minute picture is unimaginative and poorly shot. ""The Great Train Robbery"" (1903), which I also commented on, is much more creative and exciting to watch.<br /><br />We see little long-haired Jack trade a cow (2 men in a cow-suit) for a hatful of beans from a merchant and later a beanstalk grows from where his mom throws them in the yard (I guess poor Jack attained the wrong kind). Jack dreams of a goose (actually it seems to be a chicken) and golden egg and the next day climbs the stalk into heaven.<br /><br />There is no effort made to be creative in this film. The stalk looks like a rope with leaves on it, the giant is just a tall bearded guy in a home with nothing abnormally large in comparison to Jack and the climax to the film where Jack makes his escape with the goose-chicken and its golden egg is miserable as a stuffed dummy falls from out of screenshot in place of the giant and then the actor takes its place - rising up on his feet in a exaggerated death dance like in most early films.

"I remember watching the Disney version and watching it now makes me think it has somehow lost its magic touch. Plenty of other renditions, Ever After put aside, of Cinderella, have, in fact, lost their touch throughout the years. Then I found this production with a flawless performance by Kathleen Turner as the evil stepmother and was blown away by the phantasmagorical essence of this fantasy story that has cast me under its spell since childhood.<br /><br />We all know the story of Cinderella, a young girl who's father died and was dominated by her wicked stepmother and stepdaughters and longs to go to the ball for one last chance for freedom. But this plot line takes a different twist in the classic Fairy Tale by causing Cinderella (whose real name is Zizola, and is only called Cinderella by her family because of her slavery) to be trapped in a situation of her father (who still lives) slowly losing himself to a dominant wife who manipulates him into playing favorites with his wife and step-daughters against his own and tries to poison him. Thus, Zizola goes out to save her father by stopping her stepmother from finding another suitor at the ball by distracting the men who come her way. There, the bored Prince Valiant has a change of heart from his dull life and falls in love with the mysterious lady in the strange dress (forged by a water nymph named Mab) with rose petals for slippers. <br /><br />What drew me to this film most of all was it's original take on the old Fairy Tale that none can compare to. It does not weave a web of lies like most Cinderella stories, it does not ignore any reason as to why Cinderella would want to attend the ball and nor does it show a shallow side to the Prince as the Disney version did. Instead it shows more of Cinderella's selfless heart more than any other production and the artwork is simply stunning! The costumes are all beautifully made, especially Zizola's sapphire blue ballgown to match the Marcella Plunkett's fantastical beauty and soft, spirit-like voice. <br /><br />I would highly suggest this film for anyone who is interested in a dream-like sequence of the classic Fairy Tale with an interesting twist. My only problem is that the producers and director did not make a full collection of other Fairy Tales with this same element and the fact that the film is now out of print.",positive

"Man oh man... I've been foolishly procrastinating (not the right term, there's a long list!) to watch this film and finally had the chance to do so. And ""news"" are: Marvellous labyrinthine spectacle!<br /><br />For any Von Trier's ""follower"": both Rigets, Element of Crime, Dogville, Dancer in The Dark, The Five Obstructions, etc... Europa is probably the differential for its greatness in visual terms. Everything is beautifully somber and claustrophobic! You really get the feeling of being inside this ""imaginary"" nightmarish time warp. Taking from the masters of surreal cinema like Bunuel, Bergman, till noir films of the 40's with acidic drops of avant-guard Von Trier leads the art-film scene as the ""well intended totalitarian"" movie maker of nowadays. His authoritarian way of dealing with very intricate issues, without being irrational, hits the nerve of the viewer with the intent to cure some of the deepest wounds we feed in our hypocritical world.<br /><br />As Utopian as it seems, I do believe people like Von Trier could help society in many ways in a broader aspect. The day films and filmmakers that carry this sort of power are no longer necessary, as a tool for reflection, perhaps it could be the start of a new era: ""The age of emotional control over our fears"". This is what he offers to us constantly through his work over and over.<br /><br />Bravo!",positive

Captain Marvel feels like bits of Star Wars and Superman all rolled into one. A couple corny lines and the fact that it was under two hours made it not as good as it could have been.

So when my husband, who is a total comic book geek and Marvel fan, went to see it I had an open mind and was coming from a positive place. But .... this movie just did not do it , for either of us. I wasn't sure if they were trying to make the female lead character to be a smartass and very arrogant just to compete with the male superhero stars but this actress came across too snotty and cocky. Even if this was a male role, the demeanor and lines that were given to this character made it difficult to like them. Having said that, I liked all of the other characters especially Samuel L Jackson and his Nick Fury character. It was fun to see some of the backstory for his character. Now, I am a little hesitant to see Endgame if her character plays a large role in that movie, which is a shame.",controversial
"This film is exactly what you get when you really over stretch your abilities, it's like someone who has just passed there driving test and then pitting them in a formula 1 Grand Prix (not I might add, the US Grand Prix as everyone might pull out due to dodgy tyres and you might just win), that is how far short this film falls.

"My Take: Typically routine and lazy straight to video attempt from Disney. <br /><br />Disney must have fallen in love with the family movie tradition that is the family dog. Many movies have devoted themselves with stories that solely center themselves with man's best friend. Disney themselves have made a handful. They also made a handful of those that are literally dogs. Add this one to that bunch.<br /><br />I haven't seen the original for a very long time, so probably I'm not the right person to judge if this straight-to-video sequel fares any better. Anyone above the age of seven aren't the right people to see it either. Perhaps only the youngest of the young will want to see LADY AND THE TRAMP II: SCAMP'S ADVENTURE, and even they would grow up and say it wasn't the best kind of family entertainment they have ever seen. I guess to be fair, I can say is that it warrants a rental, but that ain't much to say.<br /><br />This sequel pretty much picks up the parts left behind after the original oft-called classic. Lady and Tramp now have a litter of cute Crocker Spaniel pups... and one mischievous mongrel named Scamp who is a chip off the old block. Instead of the confines of home, Scamp wishes to run off with the other junkyard dogs of town, unknown of his dad's own past as one of those mongrels of the streets. To capture the charms of the original, this one throws in the same poor dog/rich dog love story, in vice-versa. Scamp falls for a one of the junkyard dogs named Angel (and who wouldn't with a name like that and a voice that sounds like Alyssa Milano?). Que replay of the famous spaghetti scene! Other than the ""cute"" factor, there is nothing in store for any audience in this lazy straight-to-video effort. Stick with the original.<br /><br />Rating: ** out of 5.",negative
"Apart from the overhyped 90s veneer, the movie was uninteresting. It ranks on the low end of Marvel films. I was checking my watch 90 minutes into the film due in no small part to the staggering lack of enthusiasm Brie Larson put into her role as Carol Danvers. Her performance, and the film's writing, lacked heart. No amount of Marvel nostalgia or impressive action sequences could fill that emotional void. Even the villain underwhelmed. But, I have to hand it to Carol, she kicks some serious alien butt. She is the most overpowered hero yet in the MCU. Nothing can stand in her way, and by the end of the movie she knows it. I for one, was just hoping for more. In the words of Captain Marvel herself, â€śI've got nothing to prove to you.â€ť Butâ€¦could you at least have tried?",negative
"""When I die, someone will bury me. And if they don't, what's the difference. Who gives a damn, huh?"" Thus the philosophy of life (or lack there of) is summed up once and for all in this less than classic but nevertheless fun spinoff of Sergio Leone's ""Dollars Trilogy.""<br /><br />In the opening scene, three obviously evil gunmen ride into a western town and, with menacing glares, they intimidate all the pathetic normal people hiding in their homes. The observant watcher will notice that each of these three bears a striking resemblance to characters from Leone's For A Few Dollars More. There is one guy in Eastwood's poncho, one in Lee Van Cleef's black suit, and one seeming to act like Gian Marie Volonte's Indio. But this movie is not about these guys. No sooner do they ride into town when they are gunned down by someone even cooler than they, a mysterious bounty hunter known simply as the Stranger.<br /><br />No. this is an altogether different story.<br /><br />In an obvious copying of Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, three gunmen are again vying for a hidden treasure. Once again there is the bounty hunter and the Mexican bandit. The Stranger (George Hilton) is a supercool bounty hunter with a penchant for shooting people while dressed up like a priest. He is after the reward for the bandit Monetero (Gilbert Roland). But when Monetero's gang steals three hundred thousand in gold coins, the Stranger gets sidetracked from his normal line of work.<br /><br />To round off the trio there is Edd Byrne's corrupt bank executive, Clayton. He too wants the money for himself. But after the money is hidden away, the only man who knows where it is gets shot. Now the only clue to the hiding place is a medallion that shows a family crest. The game is too find the treasure before anyone else does. And any gun can play.<br /><br />With plenty of gunfights, fist fights, and double crosses, the action takes these three to the ultimate showdown ripoff, a three way draw for the hidden treasure ala The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly -- but with a twist.<br /><br />This movie is not as good as Leone's films, of course, but in the end who gives a damn, huh? This movie is fun -- 60s nihilism, spaghetti western style. There are no rules, no enduring loyalties, and no right or wrong -- just the treasure and whatever it takes to get it. And, though the movie is not classic, the ending surely is. Hey, maybe we all can get along after all, for a hundred thousand a piece.<br /><br />If you like spaghetti westerns, check this one out. It is fast, furious, and worth the look.",positive
"Even by the standards of most B-movies, this movie is by far the worst I've ever seen. The graphics are so poor that a man in a monster suit looks more realistic. the ocean water effects are especially laughable, including the one scene where they board the mini-sub, and the ""water"" looks like its frozen in place. The problems with this film are so numerous that I'll just stop here with the details. needless to say, I kid you not when I say that even Uwe Toilet Boll himself could do a better job. Avoid this movie at all cost, there are other B grade movies out there that, despite being horrible, are at least a good way of passing the time by.",negative
"Just saw it with my 14 and 11 year old boys. We are big MCU fans. I collected comic books as a kid although I'm not very familiar with the Capt Mar-Vell character. I kept my expectations low going in after reading other reviews and hearing Brie Larsons comments online. I am happy to say we all really enjoyed this movie! It did not come across as feminist or forcing an agenda like Last Jedi. It was fun and funny. I liked the 90s throwback, the Air Force backdrop, the prequel feel to the 2008-2018 movies and the additional information on MCU alien civilizations. SLJ's character was great as a less stressed and more humorous younger Fury. I thought Brie Larsen did well in a complex Carol Danvers origin story where the story needed time to pan out. I don't want to say any spoilers, I'll just say her character will continue to grow and develop just like the rest of the Avengers characters do. Go get some popcorn, grab your kids, let go of your angst and go enjoy a fun new MCU hero! ",controversial

"Looking backwards to that year 2002 when ""Furia"" was made, one can easily recognize the heralding sings of today's New Generation in Romania.<br /><br />The main qualities of ""Furia"" stand in a very solid script, with a substantial dramatic core and a really professional developing, plus a cast of excellent actors. All four leading roles are admirably performed, both with depth and casualness: Dragos Bucur and Andy Vasluianu confirmed, since then, being two of our best performers today, Dorina Chiriac follows them closely, and Adrian Tuli, a non-professional (in real life, a graveyard manager!) cast as Gabonu, was a genuine revelation! <br /><br />Further, Radu Muntean's directing is skilled and expressive, creating in a very compelling style that feeling of ""a fateful night"" and inescapable destiny. One can easily pass over the few awkward and even failed moments, since time proved them to be only the uncertainties inherent to a debut, never repeated in his subsequent movies: ""Hârtia va fi albasträ"" and ""Boogie"".",positive

"Me and a group of friends rent horrible videos to laugh at them, trust me it has lead to some horribly spent money but also some great laughs. S.I.C.K. is one of the better horror-but-funny movie we've rented. The plot is over-done, the whole take your friends into the woods and never return thing is very old. The goriest part of the movie looks like your visiting the local butcher shop except a little dirtier and with blood on the play dough looking meat. And if anyone has ever been scared of this movie at any time they should stick to Cartoon Network for the rest of their life, it's pathetic. The good aspects of the movie are that the two girls in it are reasonably hot, one better then the other and you see them both naked during the movie. The other good aspect is that this movie is so bad at times that you will laugh till you cry. I don't like watching horrible acting or renting these horrible videos, I don't find that fun but seeing the amount of effort these people put into it and still come out so bad is hilarious and worth renting.Unless you are too mature to laugh at someone's downfalls I would recommend it.<br /><br />If your renting/buying it to laugh at it I'd give it an 8.5.",negative
"Why do I like DISORGANIZED CRIME so much? Why do I chuckle or laugh out loud any time I think of a dozen or more scenes from this movie? It's kind of hard to explain, but I'll give it a try. First of all, it's very funny indeed - in contrast to what lots of ""official"" reviews want you to believe. But then again, that depends entirely on your sense of humour, so there is no sense in arguing about that. Often the humour is in the dialogue, and often it is situational comedy. There is for instance this very hilarious scene in which the 4 gang members have been given a lift in the back of a truck. When the farmer drops them, they just stand there by the road, covered all over with cow s*** or whatever. They are totally unnerved; then, realizing the humour of the scene, they one by one start laughing about themselves, and Ruben Blades (as Carlos), looking (and certainly smelling) terrible, nonchalantly takes out some mouth spray to at least do something about his breath (simply describing the scene here makes me chuckle again!). Which leads to the second point: the acting. Fred Gwynne, Lou Diamond Phillips, William Russ, Ruben Blades and Corbin Bernsen (okay, the latter overdoes it a bit at times) all fit and play their parts beautifully - in fact, you get the feeling they must have been enjoying themselves too when shooting the film. Thirdly, there is the plot . Jim Kouf, the director and screenwriter, is very laid-back; he takes his time to let the plot unfold and have the individual characters establish themselves. More often than not, there is no real action, and yet you enjoy these 4 very different people - who attempt to rob a bank although their boss (Bernsen) does not seem to turn up - grumble about each other and even-tually, grudgingly, like each other. The movie is a fantastic parody of the typical bank robbery plot - totally impossible with all its twists and coincidences, yet utterly convincing in its love for ironic details. Incidentally, the title of the film is one of the best I have ever come across, because it per-fectly summarizes the plot in a very ironic way. Therefore, take my advice: watch this film, but if you don't chuckle, grin or smile during the first 10 minutes, forget it - it's not your type of film. PS. The only negative thing about this movie is that there seems to be no way to get hold of the screenplay - if you happen to know how, do tell me.",positive
".I'm very much looking forward to watching Avengers End Game and have been a huge fan of the MCU through all their movies. That being said--this movie didn't do a good job of passing the torch created by the characters from the original Avengers movie to the next generation. While I personally think Brie Larson did as good a job as she could with the sub-par script (as well as Samuel L Jackson and other characters)- her characters major ""lesson"" wasn't very relatable in how she didn't struggle with anything I, my fiancĂŻÂż 1/2 (C)e, parents, friends really face. I was cheering for her more than the Villian of the movie, which is different from the Black Panther movie and a quality that's really important in a superhero movie. nnMost of how I felt about this movie is biased. I'm a huge comic book fanatic. I know the original storylines from Captain Mar-vell - to Ms Marvel - to Nick Fury's history - to the Kree/Scrull war. Going into the movie with few expectations but wanting to see the iconic moments and plots from the comics continue in the MCU - and have this movie start off new comic book characters for years to come, I was very disappointed. Again, most of the fault was to the writers in my opinion. This movie had lots of weight on its shoulders and had to introduce a new character to replace the old favorites - and Captain Marvel fell under the pressure.nnAll things considered an okay stand alone movie for the casual movie go-er...

"I normally do not take the time to make comments that few people will read, about movies few will see. However, in this case, I feel I must warn all those who might consider wasting time on it. I just finished watching it only five minutes ago. This is, quite simply, one of the worst movies that I have ever seen in my life. The acting is horrible, a plot is nonexistent, and production values are poverty level at best. I know that even a low budget movie can be great, but not this one. There is only thing that could have saved this movie for any horror fan's purposes--more on-screen gore and slashing! The grand total of three times that this occurs is off-screen. While it is effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens--especially the end scene--there is simply not enough of it. The movie is just too long for it's minimal content, too dialogue heavy, and consequently almost impossible to watch. What happens? To put it all in a nutshell with room to spare, three teenage girls irresponsibly and knowingly go out driving through an isolated area where over 20 girls have previously been abducted and murdered. Their car, of course, breaks down, and they are taken to an old boring house inhabited by three crazy people--one of whom is the psychotic killer. All three are eventually murdered, one by one, off-screen, after what seems like an eternity of boring, slow-paced nonsense. As I said, the only things worth watching even once are the murders. Please don't buy it or rent it just for that, and don't be fooled like I was by the misleading box art and movie description. Save your money and your time.",negative
"**Spoiler* It gives away the very irrelevant ending**<br /><br />At the beginning of this movie, there was a brief intro to the world of gore by the master of gore movies, H.G. Lewis. He talked about how this movie was lost, and then found years after the director's death. He also talked about how gore movies were measured by the amount of stage blood used in it. Blood Feast was a 2 galloner, 10,000 Maniacs was a 5 galloner. But, then he goes and claims that Dr. Gore was a 15 galloner. I want to know where half of the 15 gallons went. Watching the movie, I saw very little near 15 gallons. Agreed, there was a fairly large amount of blood, but no where near 15 gallons. Some of the dismemberment scenes were definitely pretty gory and realistic, strings of flesh and all, but I wouldn't say 15 gallons.<br /><br />""END!!! ENNNNNNNNNDDDDDD!!!"" Does that sound familiar? That's what you should have been saying near the last half of this movie. After the Igor character was tossed into the acid bath, the movie slowed to a painful crawl. There was no coherent end, as it didn't fit into anything the 90 minutes before it provided. She drove off in a van with a total stranger, BIG DEAL! That's what happens when you keep an individual (I won't say person, because she doesn't qualify as a person) very innocent about the world around her. The doctor teaches the girl that a man is to be loved, so every man she meets, she loves.<br /><br />Even though H.G. Lewis told us at the beginning of the movie that we may not like the acting, the directing, or even the gore... I will go with choices A and B. BOTH WERE TERRIBLE!! It was enough to give me bad dreams of cut editing and people with shifty eyes as they talk to one person. But, I made it through the movie, and came out stronger. Too bad I couldn't say the same after finishing ROBO C.H.I.C.<br /><br />This was a BAD movie. I can usually take my doses of vinegar in good stride, but every once in a while, you get a movie that bites back. I think this movie took off an arm or a leg (haha... *sigh*) Admitted, I did enjoy the stare down scenes, where the good doctor stared at his future victims and opened his eyes REALLY wide and just stared. It was VERY similar to Fuad Ramseys in Blood Feast when he stared at that lady in his catering shop, and did not use his power after that. I guess this movie picks up where Fuad's powers left off.<br /><br />*Final Judgement* The movie should have stayed lost. Good day<br /><br />-Scott-",negative
"The good news: the director is reportedly committed to the cause of Amnesty International and eager to deliver a solid message about the freedom of expression and the evil of oppression. The plot is distinctly original and the actors are two of my absolute favourites. The not-so-good news: 'original' is not everybody's buzzword when visiting the movies or video stores. Also, noted critics like Mr Maltin and Roger Ebert have dismissed the film as a genuinely failed attempt to convert a play from stage into cinematic form. If I remember correctly, the title is taken from the fairy tale Stowe's character has written and which has made her a possible subversive and suspect person in the fictitious place where the story takes place. Her dreams are dangerous to the government, represented here by Rickman as the intense, manipulative interrogator. Since those two people are virtually the only ones appearing in the film altogether, the director is in for a real challenge in keeping the viewer's attention. In the end, I found the whole thing fascinating. Not flawless and definitely not for everyone, but rewarding. It's nowhere near a masterpiece like Kieslowski's 'A short film about killing' or as explanatory as 'Dead man walking'. But if you're into those films or any of Costa-Gavras political thrillers, you may appreciate this one as well. Just don't expect any overexplicit sermons or eyefilling action sequences.",positive

"The film is a middling effort compared to Marvel's usual standards. Not as fun, not as engaging, not as coherent. I don't really care about the feminist stuff, but I do care about how heroism is portrayed in the MCU - and I think this portrayal was lacking. Avengers are reluctant, self-sacrificing heroes fighting for something greater than themselves. Carol Danvers is more like an aggrieved victim eager to humiliate her tormentors. Every hero should have a vulnerability, inner doubt, or moral conflict. Danvers has none of these. Her powers are established early on, so she never seems to be in any real danger; and her confidence is unwavering throughout the film. Death is a real risk for Tony, Steve, Natasha, and the others. Even Thor has talked about his own mortality, seen his brother, mother, and best friend killed, and watched his father die. Carol doesn't really face death in the film in this way. She empathizes with the Skrulls as fellow victims, and she seems a little perturbed when her Air Force commander buys the farm. But it's hardly the kind of character-forming personal loss that Steve, Thor, Wanda, Peter, T'Chala or so many others have suffered. Another characteristic of a hero is that their fight for the whole world is personified in a relationship they have with a single special character. Each Avenger, has a deeply personal friendship or love whom they fight to protect with all their being. Wanda had Pietro. Tony has Pepper. Steve has Bucky. Carol is supposed to have her Top Gun pal, Maria. But while they share a couple of slightly touching moments, Carol seems so tough and powerful, the feelings just don't show through. Maybe I'm expecting too much for an origin story, but I just don't see Captain Marvel fitting the MCU mold yet. I guess we'll have to see...",controversial
"The best thing about the movie is the name, as it both describes the plot and the acting. At least they cannot say they didn't warn you... Kind of like the button labeled, ""Don't push this"".<br /><br />Segal must have run out of things that move like planes, trains, and ships but the plot remains the same. Under cover guy who fights slowly, but still beats like 40 mercenary types and doesn't even blink when doing so. What amazes me is that Segal is now as big as a barn and the bad guys still cannot hit him in a hallway with a machine gun and 50 clips of ammo. Where do all these bullets actually go to? The only redeeming feature of this movie is watching Nia Peeples pound Ja Rule (real name Jeffrey Atkins doesn't quite sound so punk) into the floor. I could spend days watching that woman kick her foot over her shoulder like that... especially wearing an outfit like that! It was just a bonus watching Jeffy get is *ss kicked, and fun hoping one of those kicks actually landed. Sorry, it's just time we get stupid wannabe tough guy can't act rappers out of the movies. PLEEEEEASE! Who came up with idea anyway? I'd lay odds it was the person who decided that Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore would pass as witty athletic Angels.<br /><br />The only surprising twist in this movie is that they don't do the politically correct thing and have Jeffy come in and save the day.

As a main character she plays a pivotal part of the move, especially because this is a ""superhero backstory"" type movie that marvel so loves to do. Don't get me wrong, marvel excels at this style of film, I enjoyed: Captain america the first avenger, Iron man, Spider man homecoming, Thor and many others, but this isn't a problem with the genre. Brie Larson (in my opinion) was the wrong actor to cast for this move. Captain marvel should be portrayed by a powerful, refined and intelligent lead. But instead we got stuck with a whiny attention seeking failure of an actor that has to make everything onscreen and off a political debate. This is a superhero movie for crying out loud, I don't care about your political ideals. That's the last thing that comes to mind when i'm watching a movie, i just want to be entertained. And that' the problem. The movie seems less like a way to entertain fans, and more of a way to complain about how hard it is to be a woman. Wonder Woman gives the same message that woman can be powerful leaders without the complaining, bad acting and unrealistic scenarios. Not to mention that this movie tears away decades of cannon marvel history in favour of bland rewrites of previously good explanations.The only thing this move really has going for it is good special effects, the infamous and witty Samuel L Jackson and a good plot twist. overall an okay film that I don't plan on ever watching again.",negative

".Despite the running time, Captain Marvel moved and felt like a breath of fresh air in lieu of the films contemporaries within the MCU. Despite the feminist undertones, I was glad to find the film not overly preachy, yet finding stable ground in the era in which I was born, setting the perfect backdrop for a film that boasted damn near every great thing about the 90s : great comic book stories that drastically change the perception of the lead characters, experimental and grunge rock, TLC's ""Waterfalls"", and Samuel L.

"I had high hopes going to see this, as I always enjoy Paul Bettany's performances. I thought he was very good as Darwin, and did his best considering the terrible material he had to work with.<br /><br />Darwin's book On the Origin of Species was one of the most ground-breaking, controversial and innovative publications ever, yet you'd never think it based on this tedious movie. It's like a two-hour episode of a soap opera in a Victorian setting. There is virtually nothing about Darwin's five-year voyage on The Beagle to the Galapagos Islands, for example, surely of supreme significance to the story, as it was from his investigations of the wildlife thereon that he began to form his theory of evolution.<br /><br />This is just one long, dreary, domestic drama, with Darwin portrayed as a slightly loopy eccentric, seeing visions of his dead daughter everywhere and being given the cold shoulder by his emotionally-constipated wife. Jennifer Connelly's portrayal of Emma Darwin is nothing short of awful and bears little relation to historical descriptions of the real Emma. There could have been an opportunity here to present the creationist interpretation of life on earth, from either Emma or from the local priest, as played by Jeremy Northam (a blink-and-you'd-miss-it part which is a complete waste of a talented actor) to act as a counterbalance to Darwin's views, but it wasn't taken up. <br /><br />The story focused too much on endless mawkish sentiment about Darwin's grief for his daughter Annie, and too much time was also wasted in Darwin wondering whether or not to write his book. Eventually I was so bored it was difficult to care. <br /><br />All in all, this was a bit like making a movie about Picasso and spending two hours concentrating on him having a fight with his girlfriend and not bothering to mention that he was an artist.",negative

Being a father of four girls, this movie conveyed to them that women are strong and can do anything a boy can do. This action packed superhero movie held its own against most and surpassed many more.

This movie definitely was feminist, but I did not feel that it pushed it as much as Wonder Woman did where almost every scene away from the Amazonians involved people gawking and saying â€śbut she is a woman!â€ť Overall, I thought this film had a great, fun tone that is a perfect lead in to Avengers End Game which is looking to have a darker aesthetic.

It is a pain to watch the collapse of one of the most beloved cinematic universe. I do not know who can be satisfied by seeing a product of such a low quality. Definitely not me. Neither the acting of Brie Larson, nor special effects, nor the script, nor the direction can claim a positive assessment. Marvel Studio had all the necessary resources to do something really worthwhile. But why should they do that? Maybe on the eve of the ""Endgame"", everyone will go to the theaters? As it turned out, this is far from truth. Somebody can try to convince us that the film was a victim of bloodthirsty trolls, but in fact, there is only one victim - the viewer.

So the military and some scientists build one of those high-tech drilling machines to go inside the Earth and fix things (it just wouldn't be as much fun if they didn't have to go somewhere like space or inside the planet). There's even a line the tries to make the journey into the Earth sound more impressive than the journey into space (like the one in ""Armageddon""). It's a Sci-Fi Network movie, so the script is paint by numbers disaster movie. There is in-fighting between scientists and military guys, there are rock-melting lasers, people die and sacrifice themselves for the good of all, and above all, there are (weak CGI) special effects.

It was like seeing two different interpretations of the same character.nnIt's worth a watch if you like superhero movies but it's forgettable compared to other movies in the same genre.,negative
"I was skeptical about this movie. I did not buy in to the Ă˘BroenLsrson is a anti white male feminstĂ˘? narrative spread around by the internet, but I was skeptical about weather or not Brie Larson could shake the backlash from some Ă˘fansĂ˘? and deliver a great performance. Now that I've seen the movie I'm very happy to admit I LOVED it. It wasn't the best MCU movie of all time, but it was a very good introduction to a mysterious character who will obviously play a big role in future MCU films. Some of the action scenes were a little Ă˘averageĂ˘? but overall the film was a hit. Brie Larson delivered a stellar preformance & was not Ă˘boring & unenthusiasticĂ˘? like some people said she was (people that hadn't even seen the movie let alone more than 1 trailer mind you)... Nick Fury, Agent Colson, and all of the side characters fit in very well. I loved how every little detail, every line of dialogue in the movie meant something. This movie ranks about 7-8 on my favorite movies of the MCU, not a masterpiece like Infiinity War, Winter Solider, or Civil War, but definitely a Ă˘high-mid tierĂ˘? film. Very excited to see Brie Larson return as Captain Marvel In Endgame & can't wait to learn more about this character! Highly recommend seeing this movie before you cast judgement upon it!",positive

"The best thing about Shrieker is the dialogue. Like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, this movie is cognizant of the conventions of this type of horror movie and manages to come up with a few good lines and scenes that play on those conventions. Unfortunately, Shrieker is just boring. The plot is your basic Ten Little Indians whodunnit with a monster controlled by one of the suspects/victims. You know from the beginning that each of the characters will get bumped off until only the hero(ine) is left to defeat the evil. And this is exactly what happens. Absolutely no surprises and no tension. Production values and acting were ok, but I had no motivation to watch to the end (although I did) because I already knew how the end scene would play out. The ending did surprise me a bit, because it managed to fizzle out, literally, instead of throwing out a bucket of special effects. Maybe the special effects budget had been spent up by the end.",negative

"This is a hard movie to come by in the US, but if you can find it -- and you're interested in the life and music of Percy Aldridge Grainger, you're in for a treat. It's quite historically accurate. Richard Roxborough's Grainger looks astoundingly like Grainger at this period in time. Emily Woof's Karen Holten is quite a bit prettier than the real Karen, but that was an inaccuracy I was happy to discover (!). I think what really struck me though, was how well Roxborough captured Grainger's outrageous personality. Barbara Hershey's Rose was also a treasure. If she looks considerably younger than Rose did at that period, it is more than made up for in how well she captured Rose's obsession with Percy. It's an easy film to recommend. (I should note that when she saw ""Passion"" my wife had no particular affinity for (or knowledge of) Grainger and his music, but she was totally captivated by the film.",positive

"This film is, simply put, dry. It was poorly written and a waste of a talented actress (Brie Larson). There is no arch for the character, no tension, and no clear resolution for the film, less....""Well, she's out there somewhere....."" Also, retcons made to previously established lore have now lessoned other characters in the MCU, if not the entirety of the Avengers, in a sorry attempt to give ""Captain Marvel"" some skin in this decade plus long saga. Adding awkward callbacks to the 90s, underutilized support characters and unnecessary injections of forced agenda politics, the film simply doesn't deliver.

"Aside from political and social agenda this movie is your standard superhero origins story.nI do believe though that if it were a male superhero movie it would have been criticized by critics but anyways...nIn a superhero/action movie there is an arc usually with the evolution of the main character, here we don't see it, Carol Danvers suffers amnesia, always is on top, is always on top and the only time we see a weakness by reminiscing the past, a far away past that doesn't seem to match her levels during the movie. nAs an MCU fan I was a little sad about the Fury losing an eye part, the idea that Captain America: The first Avenger isn't the real title anymore because now she is and that the name of the Avengers comes from a picture seen on the wall with Carol. Now you see? This picture overcenters on her without really showing any flaws. SnComic Captain Marvel always wasn't appreciated and here Marvel had a chance to make her shine, their attempt failed for me. Hopefully some girl out there will like her more.nAlso note for RT: accept both sides of the bell, a movie will be likable for one side and ugly for the other, doesn't mean you have to remove all negatives.",controversial

"The marriage of an upscale New York City couple with child falls apart when the wife wants out (""It took a lot of courage for her to walk out that door!"" a neighbor tells us); the busy, distracted husband takes on the ""motherly"" responsibilities and grows closer to his son, but soon the wife returns. Highly manipulative picture doesn't give us a very realistic familial unit (with young Justin Henry certainly not resembling the product of a marriage between Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep!), but the dynamics are intriguing and involving, and director Robert Benton keeps the pace popping with lots of cleverness, marvelous classical music, canny editing and surefire bits of humor. Streep's character is designed to be a cold, self-centered witch, but I was ready to feel a lot more for her than Benton probably wanted. It all has to be painted in terms of black and white, good and bad, with Hoffman learning how hard his wife had it and getting a second chance at being a good parent. The film never falters from its preconceived path, and very fine acting nearly saves it, but I'm not sure where Benton was steering the film in the final act, and the closing scene is awfully abrupt. *** from ****",positive

"""Balance of Terror"" is still one of the best Star Trek episodes ever made. It was inspired by the film ""Enemy Below"" (starring Robert Mitchum), a movie that deals with a cat-and-mouse game between two captains during World War II. In this episode, Captain Kirk and his crew play similar game with a Romulan vessel. This is the program that famously introduces the war-hungry Romulans, who are distant relatives of the Vulcans. It is an incredibly suspenseful episode, tightly constructed for maximum effect. It is also interesting to see how the episode contains a series of subplots that add extra layers of meaning to the story. Mark Lenard makes his Star Trek debut as the Romulan Captain (he will later play Spock's father Ambassador Sarek). A must-see episode!",positive

Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) doesn't seem to show much emotion (nor can she un clinch her fists). She is a strong character but not one I feel like I can relate too.

Larson is a good actress, but her face acting here was laughable.nThere's a reason Disney bought off this website to change the rating system.",controversial
"It's always a little unfair to judge a film against its supposed importance; but in cases like this it's inescapable. The MCU is a cultural phenomenon which shouldn't have taken as long as it has to give us a movie with a female lead character. It shouldn't have taken as long as it did to give us a black-led movie either, but Black Panther was in and of itself one of the best films of the series. In the DC universe, Wonder Woman was terrific. So where does this sit? nnIn truth, I was a little disappointed; I'm by now a little bored of the origin story formula, and though this tried to depart from it somewhat, the whole film seemed to lack a distinctive identity. It tries to be about memory, and occasionally suggests some of the same techniques that T2: Trainspotting used to such great effect - but fails to develop them. The whole first two-thirds of the film is pretty slow going, and Jude Law is out of place in a part that signals the movie's core twist far too early. The story more successfully touches on issues of refugees and terrorism - asking questions about who the real enemies are - but again, this undercut by overly signalled twists. nnThe final third is well put together; Brie Larson is a fine actor who fills the role admirably and deserves a stronger vehicle than this. There are some nice feminist nods - the destruction of the Arnie poster early has been mentioned many times, and is a powerful symbolic nod. But the film takes so long to deliver what it needs to. Ironically given the film's feminist position, it serves better as an origin story for Nick Fury (and his eyepatch); and the cat, of course, is a fine touch. nnThe problem isn't the character of Captain Marvel - I want to see more of her, both in the Avengers and possibly even a film of her own. But it needs a film that doesn't try so hard to make me nostalgic for 90's music and a time when the otherwise excellent Annette Bening doesn't appear to have been made up to look like Hilary Clinton. It's not that it's a bad film; it's just a let-down, a disappointment, a sense of what could have been when compared to Black Panther and Wonder Woman. Captain Marvel needs better service than this.",controversial

The film features sumptuous costuming and sets and a good cast and acting.

"This sad little film bears little similarity to the 1971 Broadway revival that was such a 'nostalgic' hit. Keep in mind that when Burt Shevelove directed that revival, he rewrote the book extensively. I have a feeling that this screenwriter wrought as much of a change from the original 1925 version as well. I played the 'innocent philanderer' Jimmy Smith on-stage in 1974, and thought this $1 DVD would bring back memories. Not a chance. Even the anticipated delight of seeing ""Topper"" Roland Young play 'my' part was a major disappointment. Three songs from the play remain, and are done very poorly. Even the classic duet, ""Tea For Two"", is done as a virtual solo. The many familiar faces in this 1940 fiasco do not do themselves proud at all, and the star, Anna Neagle, just embarrasses herself. When I feel gypped by spending a dollar, I know the film must be bad. Another commentator mentioned the Doris Day version, which is actually called ""Tea For Two"" and is about doing the stage play (the original, of course), so those who are seeking the true ""No No Nanette"" might find a more recognizable version there.",negative

"Fun, entertaining movie about WWII German spy (Julie Andrews!) falling in love with American pilot (Rock Hudson), while trying to get secrets from him.

Also it has Andrews doing a strip-tease (strictly PG material) and singing a beautiful song--""Whistling in the Dark"". The movie does have problems. Andrews and Hudson did not get along during the shooting of this--and it shows. Their love scenes lack spark and they have zero sexual chemistry. Still, they turn in OK performances.

"Lets start right off with - I'm not a boy or a bot. I'm a star wars fan who was genuinely excited by 'The Force Awakens' and very let down by 'The Last Jedi'. It wasn't the worst movie ever but it wasn't great. First off - who let Lucas write again? Didn't we decide that was a terrible idea? The dialogue is bad (and yes I know Star Wars films traditionally have cheesy ass lines) and most of the jokes are tone deaf and/or fall flat. Rose's ""beautiful lousy place"" line was so bad it was incredible. Kylo Ren (arguably the best part of the film) keeps saying ""kill the past"" and yet all this movie does is recycle the same Star Wars tropes over and over and over again. I couldn't believe the end was ANOTHER rebels-trapped-in-rebel-hold-while-AT-ATs-attack (Hoth did it better). I understand that ""The Force Awakens"" had to gently get the audience to trust the Star Wars franchise again by lovingly following the old movies but now that you've got us - could you please do something more interesting and new? In general the cartoonification of it all was annoying. I don't need that many stupid creatures. I don't need General Hux made up to look more sickly and evil than in the 'Force Awakens' and then have everybody fling him around like a comic relief puppet. One of the joys of Star Wars is when the writers can walk the line between serious drama and realizing its a space opera. This movie's slapstick stupidity drowned the few dramatic pearls. I have so many things to complain about - the editing and pacing of the film was terrible. Finn and Rose's story was completely pointless. The force was used to do tricks that I guess were suppose to be cool (surviving space?) but came off as dumb. I usually agree with the critics reviews but now I'm wondering if Disney slipped them some cash. I'm writing this review in the hopes that maybe....maybe somebody is listening to the audience reviews (and not just writing them off as angry fanboys).

"I had been looking forward to How to Lose Friends & Alienate People for months, particularly due to the fact that Kirsten Dunst and Simon Pegg were starring. Simon Pegg is a comedic genius and Kirsten Dunst has always been a favorite actress of mine. How to Lose Friends & Alienate People hit the spot! Of course not perfect, but very enjoyable and funny. How to Lose Friends & Alienate People follows the life of Sidney Young, a smalltime, bumbling, British celebrity journalist, who is hired by an upscale magazine in New York City. In spectacular fashion Sidney enters high society and burns bridges with bosses, peers and superstars. After disrupting one black-tie event by allowing a wild pig to run rampant, Sidney catches the attention of Clayton Harding, editor of Sharp, and accepts a job with the magazine in New York City. Clayton warns Sidney that he'd better impress and charm everyone he can, if he wants to succeed. Instead, Sidney instantly insults and annoys fellow writer Alison Olsen (Kirsten Dunst). He dares to target the star clients of power publicist Eleanor Johnson (Gillian Anderson). He also upsets his direct boss Lawrence Maddox (Danny Huston). Sidney finds creative ways to annoy nearly everyone. His saving grace, a rising starlet Sophie Maes (Megan Fox) who develops an odd affection for him. In time, Allison's friendship might be the only thing saving Sydney from his downward spiraling career. The storyline is very interesting and the acting was top notch with what the actors were given. Simon Pegg is still hilarious as ever! He makes Sydney bumbling, obnoxious, and annoying as real as it gets, but later in time making Sydney not just likable, but also a real character who you root for in the end. Kirsten Dunst and Jeff Bridges were brilliant! Kirsten had some very wonderful acting and hilarious scenes, and Jeff Bridges is just Jeff f*cking Bridges! How can you not like him?! He makes Clayton a very humorous character with some wit and overall you just love the guy. Gillian Anderson, Megan Fox, and Danny Huston were great as the supporting cast. Each had their own personality that were overall pretty unlikable, but that's what just made the film work. One thing I didn't enjoy was how one dimensional some of the characters were. I understand that most were the supporting cast, but some of the cast was underused and could've given the film some more spice to it. How to Lose Friends & Alienate People will never be on anyone's top 10 films ever, or even top 10 comedies ever, but it has a very high entertainment level and some scenes may even charm you as well. How to Lose Friends & Alienate People is definitely one of the better romantic comedies of the year! 8/10",positive
"With all the controversy surrounding the film and star Brie Larson, Captain Marvel turned out to be an enjoyable movie, although perhaps out of place in the current ending of phase 3 of the MCU. I must say that I was worried that the movie would be pushing a hyper-feminist narrative and from the trailers, Brie Larson did not seem to be a very likable character.  After watching the movie, I must admit that not only was the feminist narrative way overstated on the Internet, Brie Larson was fairly charming as Captain Marvel.nThe story itself, set before any other MCU movie in the mid-90s, was a simple origin story which flipped the ""Who's the bad guy?"" narrative on its heels.

Very well worth watching.",positive
"I liken this movie the most to Captain America the first Avenger. It has a similar story arc, if not a story line. If you are a Marvel Movie fan then this is a must see. However, as a stand alone movie it will depend on your personal taste. If super hero movies are not your thing, then definitely skip this one, as it is well centered in the super hero genre. The current 62% audience score seems to be downward weighted, perhaps by internet trolls. The Tomato meter is a better indicator, as I think the movie could be justifiably as low as 73%, but not higher than 88%.",controversial
"I didn't have too many expectations going into this movie, as I didn't know too much about the character of Carol Danvers but I was still very excited. After having seen it now, I can honestly say that I loved it! Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson's performances are superb! I really enjoyed the mixture of action and humour and thought there was a nice balance of both. nThe reason, it doesn't get the full 5 stars, is that I wish, we could have seen more of the Kree and Skrull and their societies respectively. Without spoilering, I'll just say, that it left some questions open for me, that I would have liked to be answered.",positive

"To sum this documentary up in a few words is next to impossible. Every fiber of your body tells you that this is not happening right from the opening montage of rapid-fire images, through to the last shot of the clean up at Ground Zero, but every frame is real. The story was thought up by two French brothers living in New York. Jules (28) and Gideon (31) Naudet (pronounced ""Nau-day"") want to make a documentary on New York City Firefighters, beginning with a ""newbie"" from the academy and follow him through the nine month probationary period to full-fledged firefighter. Seeking the help of their close friend, actor James Hanlon (36), an actor and firefighter at Station 1, Engine 7, the Naudets sift through the ""Probies"" at the academy and find one, Tony Benetakos to focus the bulk of their documentary on.<br /><br />Tony becomes the butt of jokes and slowly learns the ins and outs of station life through the members of this close-knit family. Firefighters have a superstition about ""Probies."" It is that they are either ""White Clouds"" or ""Black Clouds,"" meaning that with the latter, all kinds of fires follow the ""Probie."" The former means that very little fire activity follows, but one day, there will be the mother of all fires. Tony is a ""White Cloud."" After some initial growing pains, Tony settles into the firehouse as if he were a seasoned vet. Then the unthinkable occurs....<br /><br />September 11, 2001 begins with a clear blue sky and an early morning call to go and see about a supposed gas leak not far from Wall Street. Because Jules has had little camera experience, Gideon hands a camera to his younger brother and tells him to ride with the chief, T. K. Pfeiffer. Arriving at about 8:42, the firefighters begin to use their gas detectors over a grate. Then the sudden roar of what seems to be a low flying airplane rips past the scene, and as Jules pans upwards, we see the first strike of the day. American Airlines Flight 11 smashes into the face of the North Tower of 1 World Trade. Pfeiffer orders his men into the fire engine and they head for the World Trade Center. Once there, Jules asks to accompany the Chief into the tower. Pfeiffer tells Naudet to stick close to him. Once inside, the full impact of the growing disaster begins to show on the faces of the men whose sole purpose is to save lives. <br /><br />Gideon Naudet decides to leave the firehouse and walk down to the impact area. Once there, he captures the impact of the second plane, United Airlines Flight 175, with 2 World Trade. He knows Jules is with Chief Pfeiffer inside the towers. Watching and capturing the crowds' reaction to the unimaginable, Gideon begins to capture on tape the growing fear in Lower Manhattan. Inside tower one, Jules records the last view the world, or loved ones will have of their sons, fathers, uncles, grandfathers, husbands, boyfriends, friends as one by one, each firefighter, carrying 60 lbs of equipment begin the long arduous climb up 80 stories to rescue the injured and trapped. Jules also catches the last glimpse Chief Pfeiffer will have of his brother, Kevin, as he leaves to do his selfless duty. Also caught on video is the gutwrenching sound of falling bodies hitting pavement from victims choosing to jump from the higher floors above the impact zones, sooner than face death at the hands of the flames and smoke. But Jules is respectful, never once does he capture a sensationalistic moment...the money shot. His work is professional through his baptism of fire. He also catches the sight of debris falling from tower two after it is hit by the second plane and the ordered way the firefighters evacuated civilians from the building. Then Jules is caught in the collapse of the south tower and the first official victim is taken: Father Michael Judd, the Chaplain for the fire department. Then as Jules and Chief Pfeiffer make their way from the fallout of the collapse of tower two, tower one begins its structural collapse. <br /><br />What results is a breathtakingly, poignant view from inside Ground Zero as Jules and Gideon work separately to document that day. Not knowing if either is alive, each fearing the worst. As each firefighter arrives at the firehouse, they greet each other with joyous hugs at having made it back. And in one moment of overwhelming emotion, Jules and Gideon are reunited. As Jules cries on his brother's shoulder, Gideon embraces his younger brother as Hanlon makes the filmmakers the subject. There is one fearful moment when Tony Benetakos, who left the station with a former chief, is believed to have been lost...but returns to the fold, this ""Probie"" has proven himself.<br /><br />Shown with only three interruptions, 9/11 is a stunning achievement in documentary filmmaking. It ranks up there with the Hindenburg footage in showing history as it unfolds. The Naudets are to be commended for their deft handling of the subject. In lesser hands, the tendency would be toward the sensational, but the Naudets temper their eye toward dignity and compassion. Narrated by Hanlon, we get the feel of his words as he takes the audience through the events of September 11. Robert De Niro hosts the program in a sombre, restrained way. He never seeks the camera for his own glory, rather he lays out the scenes you are about to see. I also commend CBS for their bravery at airing this special. Chastised for their attempt at grabbing ratings, they temper their editing toward the emotions of the relatives of those who perished. This is a must see for anyone who needs to be reminded of what true heroism is. It isn't about dribbling a basketball, or selling an album of hate lyrics...9/11 is about humanity at its best. Heroism at its finest and the cost of freedom. <br /><br />",positive

She could have done so much with the Ă˘~Mar Vell' role.

Her character finally showed some pizzazz once there was flying/piloting involved. nnJude Law was fantastic. His character was believable and I wanted that same zeal from the other actors. Samuel L Jackson, Djimon Hounsou, Gemma Chan, and Ben Mendohlson all brought their A-game. nnBut the movie was about Captain Marvel- not the cre or bad guys.

"""Bend It Like Beckham"" is a film that got very little exposure here in the United States. It was probably due to the fact that the movie was strongly British in dialogue and terminology and dealt a lot with football, (soccer here), which some may have trouble relating too in the U.S. It's unfortunate because this movie is absolutely fantastic and deserved much more coverage over here. I think the basis of the storyline, (following a dream), is something many people can relate to and in the end, ""Bend It Like Beckham"" proves to be a good-feeling film with a source of inspiration and really good acting. I was not overly excited about seeing this film initially but now I regret not seeing it sooner. I highly recommend this movie!",positive

This was a great movie. I was entertained the entire time. Her personally was spot on for her character. I would definitely recommend this movie.,positive
"The synopsis of this movie led me to believe that it would be a story of an unconventional woman challenging the conventions of the society in with she lives. I like strong female characters and expected a movie much along the lines of ""Chocolat"" with a less fairy tale and more bite. What I got was a cast of despicable characters.<br /><br />For a character-driven movie to be effective, I need to feel a connection or compassion for the people. There was no one with whom I could relate in the movie. Grazia (Golino, whose work I admired in ""Rain Man"") portrays a mentally ill, probably bipolar, female that is often rude, aggressive and violent. Her husband bickers and yells, when he is not hitting or slapping someone. The children are rude brats. They yell at each other and the females in the movie. They attack other children with no provocation. Violence begets violence. This seems to be an island of unfeeling, aggressive, violent and rude people all the way around.<br /><br />The direction is not compelling. There are intermixed scenes that attempt to be art, but instead bore the viewer. The location is exceptionally gorgeous, but even that fails to be captured to the degree that it could be on film.<br /><br />I would have to recommend that you stay away from this failure of a movie.",negative

"Another fantastic offering from the Monkey Island team and though it was a long time coming and had to survive the departure of Ron Gilbert it's another worthy installment.

"The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film . If you remember the 1974 film then you will remember Kersey was a "" Conchie "" during the Korean war and that he was physically sick after he committed his first execution . Ten years later Kersey seems to have learned unarmed combat and how to handle anti tank weapons in his spare time . But I`ll overlook that gaffe because DW3 is the best of the sequels , lowlife scum bags get shot dead , burned alive , their teeth smashed , and thrown to their deaths by middle aged housewives armed with sweeping brushes . Yeah I know the gang members are multi ethnic and for that they deserve some credit but even if they`re not racist they`re still murdering scum who deserve all they get from Kersey and the innocent citizens .

"Remake of the classic 1951 ""The Thing From Another World"". 12 men are in a completely isolated station in Antartica. They are invaded by a thing from outer space--it devours and completely duplicates anything it chooses to. It starts off as a dog but gets loose--and has a chance to duplicate any of the men. Soon, nobody trusts anyone else--they're isolated--the radio is destroyed--their helicopter likewise. What are they going to do?<br /><br />The 1951 film had the thing just be a big, super human monster. That movie was scary. This one is too--but the story is different (and based more closely on the source material--the novelette ""Who Goes There?"") and it's scary in a different way. The movie starts right off with Ennio Morricone's extremely eerie score setting just the right tone and--when the Thing gets attacked--the amount of gore is astounding. There's blood and body parts flying all over--arms are bitten off, heads detach and--in the strongest one--one man is devoured face first by the Thing. The gore effects are STRONG and real nightmare material. I don't scare easy but I had to sleep with the lights on when I saw this originally back in 1982. Rob Bottin's effects are just incredible--how this picture got by with an R rating is beyond me!<br /><br />It also has a very creepy feel--gore aside, it is very suspenseful. You're not sure who is what and Carpenter's direction and the score really build up the tension. One complaint--no one is given any distinctive personality traits. They actors just remain straight-faced and say their lines. That's annoying...but the movie still works.<br /><br />This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982--it competed with ""E.T."" and MANY critics complained about the amount of gore and there being no female characters in the movie. It's now considered one of John Carpenter's best. A must-see...for strong stomaches. NOT a date film!<br /><br />An amusing note: When this was released Universal sent a note along with all prints of the film. They suggested to theatre owners that they play the film in an auditorium near the rest rooms. They were afraid that people would be so sickened by the violence that they'd have to be close to a facility to throw up!",positive
"It's a true shame that trolls have taken to giving this movie bad reviews because in all honestly it's a great flick. Brie Larson plays a good strong female lead who can still have fun, crack jokes and have realizations of how powerful she truly is in real marvel form. The movie had its share of kick butt action sequences, heartfelt moments, humor and bright shiny superpower explosions. It was well worth the watch and support and it's unfortunate that so many people have chosen to be upset over a female forward casting rather than embrace it for what it is. ",controversial
"Anne Bancroft plays Estelle, a dying Jewish mother who asks her devoted son (Ron Silver) to locate reclusive one-time movie star Greta Garbo and introduce the two before Estelle checks out for good. Might've been entitled ""Bancroft Talks"" as the actress assaults this uncertain comedic/dramatic/sentimental material for its duration. Hot-or-cold director Sidney Lumet can't get a consistent rhythm going, and Bancroft's constant overacting isn't scaled back at all by the filmmaker--he keeps her right upfront: cute, teary-eyed and ranting. Estelle becomes a drag on this scenario (not that the thinly-conceived plot has much going on besides). Silver and co-stars Carrie Fisher and Catherine Hicks end up with very little to do but support the star, and everyone is trampled by her hamming. *1/2 from ****",negative
"I enjoyed this film while in the cinema. However the more I think about it the more plot holes appear. The best i can describe this film as is ""Clunky"". The first act is a complete mess. The middle dawdles and then the final act is simply a fun and bombastic finally.  There is probably a lot of scenes left on the cutting room floor that could have made this move more functional throughout. nnIn the end this film is a massive shoe horn in to the MCU at the expense of all existing material. Its own additions to the world building are weak and tepid at best. Simply take any character and assess them at several moments in the film. Think about what they know at that point, how they got their and what is their motivation or agenda. It will lead you to getting confused as to what is going on and why. The film covers this well by simply moving on to the next scene to cover the previous issue.",controversial

"I want to state first that I am a Christian (and that I do work in the film and TV industry) so I understand what it is like to work on a feature length film so props to the filmmakers in that regard. I'm all for positive, uplifting messages if they are true to the nature of life (that this is a fallen world and that things don't always work out ... even for followers of Christ). I'm glad that others are having such overwhelmingly positive reactions to the overt Christian message; for me it was just that the execution is where the film fell on its face. A movie lives and dies on its story and here you have one dimensional stereotypes, exposition aplenty, and spontaneous changes in character behavior that are inexplicably to say the least. I believe that a film does not have to club you over the head with its message to get the point across. I'm sure the Kendrick bros. will improve with time and that their storytelling methods will as well. Maybe they could direct someone else's screenplay as their next project.<br /><br />* Sports films are not exactly my first love but a good one (Hoosiers, Field of Dreams, etc) can inspire in a multitude of ways. If you would be interested in a PG-rated film that inspires, give Steven Soderbergh's 'King of the Hill' a look. All truth is God's truth ...",negative

"While Hayao Miyazaki's movies have always been hit-or-miss with me with regards to story, they are unequivocally gorgeous to the eye, with characters of simple animation against a backdrop of artistic images. Ponyo sticks to that formula, with a lead character so adorable I want a plush doll of her and scenery so pretty it wouldn't look out of place framed up as a picture on a wall.<br /><br />The story, on the other hand, I didn't enjoy quite as much as his last two wide-releases, Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle. It was just a tad too juvenile, coming across as more for kids and leaving adults to just enjoy the animation.<br /><br />I was also disappointed that the score done by Joe Hisaishi, who also the scores for the above-mentioned two movies, wasn't nearly as memorable this time around. While I can't quite recall Howl's score now, I still remember it being one of the most beautiful I had ever heard. Ditto Spirited's - though I only remember it being very complementary to the movie. Maybe it's because Ponyo is more juvenile fare that the score isn't quite as haunting. In any case, this movie is still a must-watch for fans of anime or Miyazaki.",positive

"A sentimental, heart-tugging family film set in England of the 1920s. A young Elizabeth Taylor wins a horse in a raffle and decides to enter him in the Grand National; fortunately, ex-jockey Mickey Rooney is around to give Liz some help. Director Clarence Brown displays some remarkable control with material that could've been excessively maudlin in someone else's hands. He and screenwriters Helen Deutsch and Theodore Reeves take great care in establishing genuine characterizations and developing the story naturally. True, there are one or two scenes that seem a bit forced, but overall it's quite affecting, and gorgeously filmed in Technicolor. The race itself is quite thrilling, and like so many great classics, there's a marvelous, three-hankie fade-out at the end. Liz proves that she was a real trooper right from the start, and Rooney--who I usually find rather annoying--is surprisingly subdued and really very good. Donald Crisp is terrif as Liz's gruff father and Angela Lansbury is a delight as her older, boy-crazy sister. Most of the acting kudos, however, belong to Anne Revere, who won a richly deserved Supporting Actress Oscar playing Liz's wise and caring mother.",positive
Saw it Sunday at a Laemmle. Liked it a lot although I wish there was more of a story line.  The haters should get over themselves. Larson was good and it was fun seeing Bening and Law.,controversial
"This was the very first movie I ever saw in my life back in 1974 or 1975. I was 4 years old at the time and saw it at a drive-in theatre. I did not grasp that this would be a classic at the time (I went to sleep about twenty minutes into the movie). After seeing it on the television-along with two of my other favourite movies Car Wash (my favourite movie) and The Wiz which seemed to come on every year about the same time all together-about 40, 50, 75 times I knew that here was a movie that I would have as one of my favourites. Those three movies were the only live action shows that I could watch as a child. <br /><br />I would not consider this to be a blaxploitation movie but rather an urban interest movie.Cochise and Preach reminded me of some of my uncles especially the Wild Irish Rose that they drank. My mother also told me about some of the quarter parties that she attended and that some of the things that occurred in the movie were similar in nature to what occurred in real life. If you are one of the two or three black people over thirty who hasn't seen this movie yet then I recommend that you buy the DVD right now. I'm glad that I was around to witness some of the goings on of the era.",positive

The acting is bad, the plot is bad, the camera angles are bad, and the effects are bad. Sure the actors are in physical good shape, but they cannot act! Sometimes i enjoy watching bad movies for the laugh, but this movie had no charm and after i saw this movie i was filled with regrets for seeing it. Sure, if you would like to see mediocre fighting without anything else then this movie is for you. If not then stay away from this film!

"I just watched the movie and was pleasantly surprised. I'm a huge MCU fan and I came to the theater having low expectations, but felt I needed to watch the film because I cannot miss any movie that builds up to the End Game.

"I didn't even watch this whole movie. Now, I like 50's sci-fi movies even when they are wildly inaccurate but this one just annoyed me. For one thing, one member of the crew on the spaceship talks and acts like he might have made it into the tenth grade. He sounds like he ought to be on a bowling league, not a space ship. Out the window of the spaceship the crew is marveling at Earth and this boob says 'Can you see Brooklyn?' and another guy says 'Sure'. And the boob says 'Gee, I wonder who's pitching?' Pardon me a moment, I think my sides are splitting.<br /><br />When they first get up into orbit the boob says 'The moon is just for looking at! Take me back down!' Watching the crew making stretched mouths and screaming from the G-forces of acceleration during takeoff is also not one of the better moments of the film. (Perhaps the film's best moment can be identified by a big ""THE END"" on the screen.)<br /><br />We also find out that they can't open the hatch because 'the boob' greased it before they took off. Sure, a space vehicle is going to be 'greased' by a member of the crew, who we later learn has never even had a space suit on before and doesn't know anything about zero gravity. As Baby Huey the overgrown fat cartoon duck once said, ""That sounds logical!"" The no-gravity-in-space effects are so bad it's painful to watch. (Everyone knows, in the absence of gravity, everything tends to go UP.)<br /><br />How this movie gets 6.3 stars out of 10, when other vastly superior films don't rate any higher, is a mystery to me. I really do like old sci-fi movies but this one is not realistic, and the lame attempts at character humor by throwing in that boob from a gas station grease pit does not work at all - it just ruins the movie. I think in retrospect it's not the whole movie I hate so much as the fact that 'the boob' is so obviously not someone who would be on a space ship - not even to 'grease the hatch.' OMG. I wonder if he checked the fan belts too. Maybe if they'd left 'the boob' off the trip it might not have been QUITE so excruciating. Even so, it's only average. What everyone else is raving about, I don't know.<br /><br />You want to watch a neat 1950's space movie? 'Rocketship X-M' beats it all to heck. Maybe not so much 'realism' but a more serious story and less goofy characters.",negative

"This is a movie that will not be remembered well in years to come. Critics claim the movie is ""subversive,"" but subversion without verisimilitude is meaningless. The correct term critics were looking for is ""nihilistic."" The only people who seem to like the movie are: A. People who have always found Star Wars annoying and enjoy seeing it be exposed to revisionism. B. People who are casual fans of science fiction/science fantasy. C. People who enjoy seeing their political views mirrored on screen, regardless as to how well written the plot and characters are surrounding the politics. All they want to see is their politics validated, character development be dammed--and I should note I agree with the politics behind the movie; I'm not some anti-SJW person.

It was so boring. I wish I could like it. Formulaic yet the moral storyline was confusing and the political one was contradicting. Jude Law is actually pretty good at his roles.

"Absolutely bland. As a both black and female fan of the Marvel Universe, this one was just flavorless.

"Upon a recommendation from a friend and my admiration of Philip Baker Hall I rented the first season disc of the Loop.It's a typical TV comedy with all the clichés that the genre employs with the ""wacky"" scheming brother (Sully), ""ditzy"" blonde (Lizzy), token unrequited love interest (Piper), sarcastic Asian helper (Darcy, which reminded me of Arliss, as if ANYone needed to be reminded of THAT show). The plot deals with various bad luck (usually by Sully) that befalls Sam that puts his job at the airplane in jeopardy, only to have him save the day, with 'hilarious hijinks' ensuing in the middle. I didn't descibe a certain episode. I described them ALL to a T. Therein lies the problem as what seems like it might even be passable entertainment at first just gets uselessly stale when watching episodes in a row and growing bored beyond belief at the endless repetition. Sully will do something 'wacky', Mimi Rogers will say something overtly sexual, Russ will tell about his gay son, Darcy will do her impersonation of Sandra Oh on Arliss blah blah blah blah blah. The only positive is the lack of an annoying laugh track. But don't let that fool you into thinking it's any good. Go watch a far better comedy. Arrested Development, Always Sunny in Phillidelphia, two name two off the top of my head. Surprised that this one is still on the air. OH that's right Fox only cancels the good shows, i forgot.

"What in God's name happened here? How does one go about creating what is practically a cheap knockoff of Redneck Zombies? Was Zombie '90 ever supposed to entertain someone ...anyone, or even make a dollars profit? But mainly, what happened here? <br /><br />Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence was directed by a lunatic by the name of Andreas Schnaas, who specializes in earth-shattering gore films, such as Goblet of Gore, and Anthropophagus 2000, and some of which contain profanity in the titles. In the gore department, this one isn't much different than the rest. Although, the level of ineptness ...well, earth-shattering.<br /><br />Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence is as bad as Peter Jackson's Dead-Alive is gory, think about it.<br /><br />Getting too specific with the story would be a waste of time. An accident, involving chemicals causes the dead to come back, and eat the living. Never has the concept been treated in such a manner. The gore effects are a whole, new low. Just a Z-grade nightmare. I can't tell whether, or not this was originally meant to be funny, somehow, I doubt the English dubbing was being very true to the original script, but stranger things have happened. The whole thing just reminds me of a shot-on-video introduction to a Troma movie, except it lasts a hell of a lot longer.<br /><br />I've seen only one film that was worse than this, The Chooper.<br /><br />For proof that Andreas Schnaas is an actual director, I would highly recommend Nikos The Impaler If you think you have no standards in what you look for in a bad movie, give Extreme Pestilence a try, but you've been warned. It takes nerves of steel to make it all the way through. But if gore is all you're here for, then you might be able to stomach this one. Other than that, no atmosphere, no, and I mean NO budget, no entertainment value, but mostly, no pride. Show some pride, Schnaas. 1/10 <br /><br />Updated 7/5/09: After a few more viewings of Zombie '90, I've had a change of heart, or I guess I just get it now. Zombie '90 is hilarious, so nevermind the harsh words, Although, Extreme Pestilence still only deserves one star.",negative

"I saw Heaven's Gate on its opening week nearly twenty years ago. Tickets were sold in advance based on the great anticipation of seeing Cimino's long in the making follow up to his 1978 masterpiece ""The Deerhunter."" The reviews came in and critics trashed the film with vehemence. An influential New York film critic led the way and most critics followed suit, and the 3hr. 40-min. film was pulled from distribution. United Artists had Cimino shorten the film by about an hour and it was re-released many months later to equally horrible reviews and to dismal business. The film at that time cost about 40 million dollars (now considered low budget) making it one of the most expensive in history and Cimino had free rein on the project with endless retakes despite it being only his third film. ""The Deerhunter"" had also received a negative backlash based on a perceived political ideology, which was not popular. I mention all this to present a possible bias building up against Cimino. At the time I thought the film was very good and when I saw the shorter version it was still very good only less so. The film showed up again in a museum in the early 1990's. They were supposed to show the long version but they could not find an existing print. Nevertheless, seeing the film years later I now thought Heaven's Gate was a masterpiece. Finally, the long version started to appear in a few select cities, I got to see it recently and it was well worth the wait. Heaven's Gate begins with the graduation ceremony at Harvard University. Two of the graduates are Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt and we some of the flaws in their characters early on. Despite the mandate Joseph Cotton gives in his speech to the graduating class to use their education to enlighten and improve their country, many of the graduates behave as if they are part of an elite country club. The film flashes ahead 20 years to Johnson County in Wyoming. A cattle company called ""the Stockholders Association"" has hired poor people to shoot 125 poor immigrants claiming they are cattle thieves. Kristofferson sides with the immigrants while John Hurt is part of the Association. Although Hurt is totally against this insane action he is too ineffectual a character to do anything about it. A massacre takes place but the immigrants do well in defending themselves. A United States Cavalry comes to the rescue of the Association to allegedly arrest them after most of the damage has been done when in fact they sanctioned the mass killing. Kristofferson also suffers a great personal loss and the film ends with him years later as part of the elite class of his Harvard days married, bored, on a yacht, living but dead on the inside.<br /><br />This is a very complex film which is brilliant in every department such as it's themes, structure, direction, cinematography, writing, music, editing, set designs, and acting. Kristofferson, Walken, Hurt, Huppert, Dourif, Bridges, Waterston, and Cotton are all excellent portraying very complex characters. Some of the major complaints I read about this film state that is ugly to look at, incoherent, too long, that the characters make no sense and that the words are often unintelligible. In its defense, Heaven's Gate has the look of photographs of that period just as ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"" did. Some of the scenes are smoky looking to suggest the industrial revolution or sometimes horses, wagons, people are passing by from all sides creating a sense of reality.(The critic who called it one of the ugliest movies ever made likes to use his thumbs a lot.) But in spite of all that, the composition of each frame and the cinematography are impeccable. The film makes a great deal of sense if you pay attention to it. Everything is not spelled out for the viewer and one has to observe closely to understand the motivations of the characters or its themes. As to its length, it is a beautifully structured piece, at times moving, poetic, exhilarating, or devastating with virtually one great scene following another. At times some of the words are unintelligible especially in some of the scenes bustling with activity. But one could understand such a cinematic film as this through its use of film language, the glances between characters or their actions. One day soon this film should be re-released in its full length so that people and critics could give it a second chance. Do not let Michael Cimino become another Orson Welles- under appreciated in his lifetime and not able to make the kinds of great films he is capable of making.",positive

Dignity vs. death is a major theme in this movie and i think it reflects the Chinese history and culture.

"I'm not a massive Disney fan, but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them, so we've built up quite a collection, and this is one of my favourites. We first saw this a couple of weeks ago and we must have see it half a dozen times since! OK, as others have pointed out, not the most complex or inventive of plots, but there's more to a film than that.<br /><br />Great characters, Phil Harris stealing the show as Thomas O'Malley, but Edgar the butler not far behind. The music is superb - my disabled son always insists that I lift him up and dance with him to ""Everybody wants to be Cat"" this says it all. And ""Thomas O'Malley"" is just as enjoyable.<br /><br />I'm not sure why some people have such a downer on this film other than a dislike of cats! And yes, it does take a few of its cues from ""101 Dalmations"", and maybe ""The Lady and the Tramp"" (It's been a long time since I've seen that, so I'm not going to compare them), and while ""101 Dalmations"" is better in some ways, for me ""The Aristocats"" is far more enjoyable. Isn't that what these films are about? <br /><br />Apart from ""Peter Pan"" (now that is a 10/10 film), this is my favourite Disney film. My 7 year-old son loves it, his grumpy 41 year old dad loves it, so you can't ask much more of a family film.<br /><br />Superb!",positive

Overall, she just came across as flat and boring with little to no emotional connection or caring.nnThe story was cookie cutter and honestly, there was no suspense or memorable battle or struggle.

"Disclaimer: This review is as I saw it, and not a troll review. n   The movie itself was decent. It wasn't overwhelming, but it wasn't underwhelming either. Just decent. Brie Larson wasn't as bad as many here are saying, but she wasn't exactly the best, and what was supposed to be fierceness made her performance come off as wooden at times. The other characters were alright, but don't expect in-depthness. However, special effects were very good, and the plot was still enjoyable, just not, to me, at the caliber of the recent marvel movies. I think if anything, my biggest issue was with how true it stayed to the comics. If you're a comic fan, be prepared for some somewhat questionable, major changes to certain characters (and I'm all for modernizing heroes, Marvel has done a fantastic job on Falcon or Fury or Hawkeye and others like them). But some of it is pushed a bit too far in my book. To me, it was alright, just not great.

A secretary believes her boss is wrongly accused of murder, and courageously takes on many dangerous characters in an effort to establish the truth. A movie with many twists and dark alleyways, none of which I will mention! The jazz band sequence where our heroine seeks the information about the killer, is one of the most erotic scenes in Hollywood history, despite being at very low budget and made during WWII in black and white. Despite the low budget - Long Island looks somewhat mountainous - this is a movie of original style and outstanding vision. Ella Raines was a great actress discovered by Howard Hawks who knew much about these matters, casting the feistiest women - Joanne Dru, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall, Ann Sheridan - of their era. Robert Siodmak was of one of several German, Hungarian & Czech film-makers - Sirk, Wilder, Zinnemann, Lubitsch, Curtiz,Lang, etc - who émigrés relocated to Hollywood, and brought a highly original fresh vision with them.

"I loved this film and I have to say that I  was skeptical about it and the female character (and I am a female myself) going in. But there have been other Marvel films I wasn't so interested in seeing and didn't think I'd like in the past and was proven wrong every time so I will always give it a chance first. Also at first I mainly wanted to see this film because all the MCU films are connected and to miss one is to miss a piece of the puzzle, especially when this character is going to be a big part of End Game. Then I was excited to see the younger Fury and Coulson and see their earlier days in SHIELD, which the scene with those characters really did not disappoint. Not knowing anything about the Captain Marvel character going in, I was afraid she wouldn't be that interesting, more of an unstoppable Supergirl that would just  make me want to roll my eyes, but I think about 10 minutes in I already liked her. Her character was better and more likable than I thought she would be, and I think they made a perfect casting choice. I was also a bit iffy with the Jude Law choice but I should know by now that the people who make these Marvel films know what they're doing, and he was fine in his role. I liked that the show had many twists and surprises and the right amount of humour. Overall I enjoyed it start to finish and couldn't really find anything negative to say about it.",positive

"For romantic comedies, I often judge the quality of the film based upon the mistiness of my eyes by the end of the experience. Unfortunately for ""The Wedding Date,"" I can only rate the film with 4 out of 10 possible tears.<br /><br />My apologies to fans of Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney, but I did not see much chemistry between their two characters. The premise of the film is a reverse ""Pretty Woman,"" with Dermot playing the role of Nick, a high-priced male escort hired by Debra's character Kat to accompany her to England for her sister's wedding. A romantic relationship presumably develops between patron and client. But the dialogue seemed forced and artificial. And there weren't enough romantic sparks flying in the relationship of Nick and Kat.<br /><br />In a supporting role, Amy Adams was a standout as Kat's sister. Whenever Amy came on screen, she served as a spark plug and catalyst for the film's energy. Perhaps if Amy Adams had been cast in the role of Kat, the film might have had more dynamism. But as it turned out, instead of reaching for Kleenex, I was looking for the Visine in attempt to at least pretend that this film had some genuine sentiment and romance.",negative

"If you were ever a fan of MTV""s ""The State,"" then these three guys will be familiar to you. But even if you only stumbled upon them via the internet like I did, you will soon come to appreciate their unique brand of comedy.<br /><br />Born out of their stand up comedy trio, 'Stella', Michael Ian Black, Michael Showalter and David Wain produced these brilliant vignettes of surreal comedy to display at their shows, and now after being available only to download from two websites, they appear in pristine glory on one DVD.<br /><br />Think comedy sketch show sans censorship, and you'd be halfway there. No stone of decency is left unturned. But for those who like their comedy rude, self-indulgent and bordering on puerile, (and I mean that in the most flattering way) this is the DVD for you!<br /><br />I think it's worth the money for the commentary from the two Michaels and David alone, you can't help but take a liking to them as they explain their actions, cringe at their own antics with sex toys and by turn pat each other on the back and hurl abuse.<br /><br />Fantastic.<br /><br />It must say something for the appeal of Stella that the likes of Julie Bowen and Paul Rudd are willing to throw themselves into the action so fearlessly.

"Base entertainment value 4/5nFamily friendliness 5/5nMeaningfulness 4/5nBottom line: this was a solid marvel movie, and i strongly recommend it.nnMy thoughts- this movie amazed me in that it hit all of the feminist talking points without coming across as a ""feminist"" movie. This is a good thing! Even if you are a devout feminist, you should be happy about this, just like I'm happy when, as a devout Christian, a movie comes out that hits all of the Christian talking points without coming across as a ""Christian"" movie.nSomething i hated: ""the Air Force still wasn't letting women fly combat missions back then, so testing Lawson's planes was the only chance we had to do something meaningful.""nThis statement seems absurd to me- is she saying that all women who aren't in combat aren't doing anything meaningful? Maybe that's too broad, maybe she's saying that for herself and Danvers, only flying for the Air Force had meaning, and this was the only way they could fly for the Air Force, but doesn't that imply that her own daughter had little to no meaning to her? I'm just really confused by this statement, but if anyone can explain to me I'd be happy to listen.nSomething I loved- ""I don't have anything to prove to you.""nI loved this statement because it perfectly illustrated my views on complimentarianism. What I've picked up from the feminist culture is that feminists believe only masculine achievements are worthwhile: they ""encourage"" women by telling them they can do whatever they want to do, but are very hard on women who value the traditional feminine virtues of beauty, vulnerability, motherhood, and supportiveness. Not to say that they have a problem with any of those things, it's just that if a woman has chosen to dedicate her life to them it's considered a waste, unless she's is also ""accomplished"" meaning she's achieved status in her career.nPersonally, I believe the feminine virtues are more powerful than any amount of ""accomplishments"", and so to see  refuse to ignore her obvious strengths when asked to ""prove"" that she could be a better man than the actual man- well, to me, that was incredibly beautiful.",controversial

But I have seen one or two others since, and I can tell you that they were stupid, but this one really scrapes the bottom of the barrel. The CGI is done poorly, the acting is bad, the script is ridiculous, and what happens at the very end is unexpected and out of place (if you have seen Dragon Fighter, you probably know what I mean; I didn't want to put a spoiler in my review). Plus, there was this one musical tune that was used in pretty much every single dangerous sequence. That was really stupid; they just played it over and over.

"Michael Keaton is ""Johnny Dangerously"" in this take-off on gangster movies done in 1984. Maureen Stapleton plays his sickly mother, Griffin Dunne is his DA brother, Peter Boyle is his boss, and Marilu Henner is his girlfriend. Other stars include Danny DeVito and Joe Piscopo. Keaton plays a pet store owner in the 1930s who catches a kid stealing a puppy and then tells him, in flashback, how he came to own the pet store. He turned to thievery at a young age to get his mother a pancreas operation ($49.95, special this week) and began working for a mob boss (Boyle). Johnny uses the last name ""Dangerously"" in the mobster world.<br /><br />There are some hilarious scenes in this film, and Stapleton is a riot as Johnny's foul-mouthed mother who needs ever organ in her body replaced. Peter Boyle as Johnny's boss gives a very funny performance, as does Griffin Dunne, a straight arrow DA who won't ""play ball"" with crooked Burr (Danny De Vito). As Johnny's nemesis, Joe Piscopo is great. Richard Dimitri is a standout as Moronie, who tortures the English language - but you have to hear him do it rather than read about it. What makes it funny is that he does it all with an angry face.<br /><br />The movie gets a little tired toward the end, but it's well worth seeing, and Keaton is terrific as good boy/bad boy Johnny. For some reason, this film was underrated when it was released, and like Keaton's other gem, ""Night Shift,"" you don't hear much about it today. With some performances and scenes that are real gems, you'll find ""Johnny Dangerously"" immensely enjoyable.",positive
"This movie had a lot of bad buzz right before I went into the theaters, and honestly after watching the film for myself I think people just overreacted. It's really not that bad. I didn't hate Brie Larson, she's a fantastic actress, but I mainly blame the writers for writing her character a bit bland. Although I do get what the writers were trying to do and I think Larson nailed the performance the writers were asking for. Samuel L Jackson as a young Nick Fury was amazing! Definitely the highlight of the film for me. Ben Mendelssohn as the villain was of course great. And props to the writers for really making a good villain this time. Which I really hope sticks with the MCU going forward. Also a lot of 90s references since it takes place in 1995. The movie is definitely a very fun action superhero movie. If you don't like that then you won't like the movie, but if you do then you'll probably like it. I guess it depends what you're looking for to come out of this film. This film it's just for pure entertainment and fun. It's not the best OR worst of the MCU films. It's somewhere in the middle for me if I were ranking it. But I still think it's a good time in the theaters.",negative

"Since musicals have both gone out of fashion and are incredibly expensive to make without all the talent needed to make one under contract to a studio, I doubt we will ever get a real life story of Enrico Caruso. <br /><br />But if everything else was in place it was no accident that no Hollywood studio attempted the task until Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had Mario Lanza under contract. No one else could have done it, I doubt whether it will ever be tried again.<br /><br />And why should it. I think Enrico Caruso himself would have been satisfied as to how his singing was portrayed on screen. For his tenor voice was his life, his reason for being on the earth. <br /><br />To say that liberties were taken with his life is to be modest. Caruso, like the man who portrayed him, was a man of large appetites although with a lot more self discipline. He had numerous relationships with several women and fathered two out of wedlock sons who are not in this film. <br /><br />His contribution to the recording industry is treated as almost an afterthought. He's shown in a recording studio once late in his life. Actually he started recording right around the turn of the last century and together with Irish tenor John McCormack for RCA Victor made the recording industry what it became.<br /><br />When Caruso and McCormack were at their heights you had to practically inherit a ticket to see either of them perform live. But a lot of immigrant Italian and Irish families had a phonograph and a record or three of either of these men. It's why both became the legends that they are.<br /><br />What the film does have is some beautifully staged operatic arias done by Mario Lanza, a taste of what he might have become had he the discipline of a Caruso to stick to opera. The Great Caruso won an Oscar for sound recording and received nominations for costume and set design.<br /><br />Mario himself helped popularize the film with an RCA Red Seal album of songs from The Great Caruso. Unfortunately due to contractual obligations we couldn't get an actual cast album with Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten, and Jarmila Novotna also.<br /><br />Though Blyth sang it in the film, Lanza had a big hit recording of The Loveliest Night of the Year further helping to popularize The Great Caruso.<br /><br />If you're looking for a life of Enrico Caruso, this ain't it. If you are looking for a great artist singing at the height of his career, than you should not miss The Great Caruso.",positive
"Brie Larson's boring romp felt like slogging through mud while someone shouted their agenda in your face. The people behind this obviously felt like their fans weren't worth the listen to because they seemed to go out of their way to attack them, especially with scenes where the main character physically assaults people for asking her to ""smile"", a common complaint from the fan-base about Brie Larson's acting.nnThe story was built around a lot of extremely overused tropes like the memory loss of a super-powerful character that would give way to her suddenly going all powerful at the end in what was supposed to be an exciting power reveal scene but ended up with Captain Marvel doing some regular fighting stuff with energy blasts and one of the most cringe-worthy songs ever in the background... a song which continued to beat the viewers with the agenda which was the crux of the entire movie. Brie Larson's character is unlikable except for a few moments when she's working with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), which also seem to be the moments when the character has a single emotion. This is especially funny because the main villain keeps telling her that she needs to control her emotions more despite her complete lack of any.nnSadly the movie also suffered from Brie Larson's inability to shut up and just do her job. Her regular attacks on the fans who criticized the movie and consistently politicizing the movie in a way which polarized and divided the fan-base rather then bringing them all together gave this movie a bad flavor. nnIn the end this movie makes the same mistake as what so many movies do: It pushes an agenda but forgets that an agenda isn't the entire foundation of good writing. I saw a lot of ""female empowerment"" messages and lots of feminist messages and even some messages about refugees but these were wrapped in the brown-paper bag of stories.

"The movie was okay. Going into this I really wanted to like it and I was very hyped up. Then it started and I was confused. That confusion carries far throughout the movie. I know that she (carol danvers) was confused too and going through inner conflict as result of her amnesia. The only problem I had with using that reasoning though was that we couldn't see the inner conflict in her face, he told her to stop letting her emotions get the best of her, but the only emotion I ever really saw in the beginning was annoyance, boredom and frustration. Even when she woke up from her nightmare or lost control of her emotions in the fight, I couldn't see any emotion. It got better near the end with Maria and her kid, that along with Carol and fury's banter were pretty much the only times I saw real emotion in the film. I know there was controversy around this film for the fact that she's not smiling and I'm totally cool with that, there's no reason for her to do so. But I had been looking for much more real emotion and inner conflict going into this movie. In the ads, it shows Captain Marvel get up after falling down multiple times, I wanted to see the motivation behind that determination, what motivated her, I wanted to learn more about the carol before the amnesia. I feel that way she could become much more relatable. And when I'm asking for emotion that's not just me telling her to smile more, that's not what I'm after. My favourite character in the MCU it's Tony Stark. In all 3 Iron man movies, I tend to care and remember his personal struggle and conflicts more than I care about the villains. He shows it on his face very well, openly for us all to see, it makes him the most relatable of all the avengers to me for that reason alone. All I'm asking is for Brie Larson, who is a great actress as seen in other films, to allow more of that nvulnerability to get through. I know she is supposed to be the strongest avenger and all, but you get stronger by working through stuff, by keeping going even when it looks bad, by doing the whole being knocked down and getting backed up, with all your inner conflict as well. I believe she could've shown this more and was given a script where this was possible. I truly hope that for any other movies she might do, she does so with more emotion. All in all it's a ok movie, not necessarily the best but not the definite worst, it's below my standards for a marvel movie but it's ok.",controversial

"""Look, I know this may suck right now, but pain is temporary, film is forever. Whatever you do right now is burned into celluloid for all time and for thousands of years to come.""  Robert De Niro<br /><br />This was initially a film for Steven Spielberg, the director hiring several screenwriters to adjust the screenplay so that it more suited his themes. And so we have a dysfunctional family that is threatened by a deranged monster in the form of a recently released from prison Robert De Niro. Like ""Jurassic Park"", ""Poltergeist"" and ""War of the Worlds"", the dysfunctional family bands together to defeat the beast, the beast being the creation of the father, a lawyer who failed to defend De Niro during his trial. <br /><br />In typical Spielberg fashion, the father kills the monster that undermines the family and is then promptly absolved of his sins. Like Oscar Schindler, Robin Williams, Sam Niel, Tom Cruise and virtually every ""daddy"" figure in Spielberg land, the father reclaims his paternal duty in the kind of bittersweet coda that Spielberg so enjoys.<br /><br />But Spielberg eventually abandoned the picture and the project was instead turned over to Martin Scorsese, who at the time was seeking to try his hand at more commercial fare. The result is arguably the worst film in Scorsese's filmography, and, ironically, his most illuminating.<br /><br />An artist's failures or misfires are often very revealing, exposing the inner workings of their art. When the story doesn't work, the characters don't connect or the images don't sear, we find ourselves left with a kind of inner core. This  the remaining carcass- is what the director's cinema is about.<br /><br />Now ""Cape Fear"" is an impersonal film, so we won't find any thematic connections to the rest of Scorsese's filmography (""You already sacrificed me!"" De Niro yells, but the films themes of Catholic redemption are cookie cutter). What the film does, though, is expose the kind of language that his filmography hinges on. Watch how Scorsese's camera desperately whips back and forth, how he zooms frantically onto doorknobs and windows in an attempt to force tension and how his characters are all loud and screaming for attention. But more importantly, watch how the film makes no spatial sense. A showdown on a boat at the end of the film takes place on an obvious sound-stage, a street parade is claustrophobic and takes place within no larger context and the family's house doesn't seem to exist anywhere in particular. There is simply no geographical sense to anything in the picture, Scorsese unable to film space or create any kind of spatial environment. <br /><br />The reason for this is that Scorsese's camera always has to be bound, or intimately tethered, to his central character. For the world around the character to make sense, his camera has to be focused on the character. Resnais can take you around a French Hotel, Welles and Hitchcock can dance you down a street and up a building, Cameron can give you a tour of the Titanic, Scott can recreate an entire future cityscape, Lucas can give you an alien desert planet, and most other directors can create a sense of space by textbook ""close up-mid shot-wide shot"" combinations, but Scorsese can't do this. There's no poetry, no sense of tangible space in his films. He's all about the character. You break that tether, you leave that boxing ring, that taxi cab, you look away from De Niro, and everything collapses. He simply cannot break away from this very documentarian style of shooting, which, in a way, is a prerequisite for action film-making.<br /><br />Scorsese tried to rectify this problem with ""Gangs of New York"", where the space and the sets become the central character, but even this self consciously spatial experiment gets sabotaged by the magnetism of Daniel Day Lewis, the actor drawing Scorsese's camera inexorably toward him like a moth to a bulb.<br /><br />5/10  Even as a generic B-movie, this is an ugly, vulgar looking film. Look at the matte paintings, the inept attempts at tension, the silly rotorscoped special effects and hokey fistfight showdown. Still, we have Robert De Niro to pick up the slack. De Niro, who gives his body over to Scorsese like a tattooed Christ, gives the film its only great scene. In an improvised romantic sequence with young a Juliette Lewis, he sticks his thumb into her mouth and kisses her. A kind of symbolic rape, the girl runs away, both aroused and repelled by this man's interest.<br /><br />But De Niro's performance, so deliciously over the top, simply can't be imitated by Scorsese. You'd need the operatic tone and the baroque visuals of someone like De Palma to make this work. But Scorsese? Nope.<br /><br />Worth one viewing.",negative

"It wasn't the most pointless animation film experience ever, but it certainly can't be admired as much as it tries to be good. Combining Dreamworks animation and computer graphics, this is the story of a mustang, later named Spirit (Matt Damon, providing the first person narration), and his journey through across the frontiers of the Old West. Basically he is born free amongst all the other horses in the beautiful countryside, then he is kidnapped to be used as a saddle horse, he manages to throw off all who try to ride him. However when he escapes his cage, along with Little Creek (Daniel Studi), the two of them form a friendship, oh, and he obviously has a thing for Little Creek's female horse. In the end, after a few more escapes, being chased by The Colonel (James Cromwell) and his men, and making a final big leap across a gorge, Little Creek lets Spirit go, and he also releases his female horse, and they run home to their countryside and fellow horses. Also starring Chopper Bernet as Sgt. Adams, Jeff LeBeau as Murphy/Railroad Foreman, John Rubano as Soldier, Richard McGonagle as Bill and Matthew Levin as Joe.

On a positive note...the scenery was pretty, fall being my favorite season. The car, the 40 Ford was also quite nice. This movie gets an D- rating approaching an F",negative
"Visually, it was an ok movie. Definitely not the cringefest I was warned about. But it most certainly has it's moments. I do not feel that any one actor/ actress added to my disenjoyment of this movie. As even the greatest actor cannot work with a garbage script/ story and I feel Ms Larson gave it her best. These 2 stars are hers. The movie as a whole is awkwardly bland, and I cannot really pick any ""STAND OUT"" moments to even praise/ criticize from any entertaining standpoint. It was fun, but meh... 2/5",negative
"A horror movie is being shot and things aren't going well. It's about a masked killer. The director tells off the killer in front of the cast and crew. He goes crazy and kills two people. He's killed himself and the film is never finished. Twelve years later a bunch of film students decide to try and finish it--but there's a curse. People who try and finish it are killed themselves. The students ignore that. Guess what happens next?<br /><br />The plot is old hat but this isn't bad...for what it is (a low budget slasher film). It's well-made with a young and fairly talented young cast. No one is great but no one is terrible either. It also avoids the obligatory (and needless) female nude scenes. It moves quickly, the gore is nice and bloody and the script doesn't insult your intelligence. Also Molly Ringwald is in this having the time of her life playing a bitchy faded actress.<br /><br />No great shakes but not bad at all. I give it a 7.",positive

Also what's up with the 55%; the entire theater was cheering and clapping at the end and I've heard similar reactions from my friends across the US who saw it.

"This film is a great time for all, no matter what you believe. The lead up to this film has been unfortunate with the politics surrounding the film and its star Brie Larson. I was caught up in it myself, finding Larson's comments and actions a bit distasteful in practice. I found myself wanting to see the film do poorly as I began equating all my dislike in the opposing political view to this film. However, after thinking about what I was actually upset about and giving the film a chance this Sunday afternoon, I came to really enjoy the film. I found myself having a great time and getting enjoyment from the film, start to finish. The journey to discover who Captain Marvel is in the MCU and how Fury was when he had two eyes was exciting. The supporting cast was probably the best in any Marvel movie. Brie Larson's Captain Marvel has been described as bland and a knock-off Tony Stark. I disagree with this statement as I feel she has begun carving out her own character. I do understand where these claims originate as Larson is written and directed to be more of a blank slate than her supporting cast. She exhibits a problem many blockbuster title characters fall into. They kind of let the plot happen to them rather than allowing their character to effect the story. In the end, you should see this film and I guarantee you'll enjoy it. Don't let the politics ruin your good time.",negative
"The movie overall is fun to watch. especially by the side characters. the intro was fun to watch captain marvel fighting her way out of the enemies hand. a bit silly on certain executions which didnt seem to blend well with the tone. no real concern for the main character. the villain appearance was a cliche along with a miss opportunity to create a more compelling villain. their is a feminist message within the movie but its not throughout the entire film or too heavy handed. the main character as i stated i didnt feel her character on the light or humorous scenes either from words or her facial talking marks of squint, raised eyebrow etc. she shines on the more heavy parts of the film. it seems the main character is truly revealed during those scenes. not all but a solid 90% of heavy scenes were good. did all the scenes made sense no but it was delivered well. its a fun marvel movie but it is not one of the greatest MCU film. movie theater level: when no other good films are out and you want to go see a movie.

The flow is constantly zip-zagging between intriguing plot twists, slow-paced sequences, breathtaking battles, semi-pointless characters and narrative archs, and impressive scenery. Some answers are given to the audience: some could turn out to be unsatisfactory and some may never be answered at all. The film is a courageous move by director Rian Johnson that will not please everyone but which could thrust this cinematic universe into wide variety of possibilities.

"Yep, Edward G. gives us a retro view of the criminal defense world. First he's an overzealous prosecutor who sends the wrong man to the chair (played passionately, albeit briefly by DeForrest Kelly), then he's so filled with remorse his only solace is the bottle. Throw in a jaded romance, a genuinely rapid descent into penury and no qualms about who he defends, and next thing you know -- Shazam! Black Leg Lawyer (god I love that phrase). He sees the light just in time to save his jaded beloved from the chair. Yawn.<br /><br />But really, the courtroom action is pure melodrama. See him punch out a witness, see him drink poison, see him argue passionately as he clutches a bullet hole in his breast. Be prepared for melodrama.<br /><br />The hoot of the film though, is Jayne Russell. With curves defying the laws of gravity and an IQ approached absolute zero, she is something to see. Even sings a bit.",negative
"It's fine, sorta funny at times.  If you're NOT a comic book fan it's might even qualify as good.  If you ARE a comic fan it's a bland lazy rehash, with terrible ret-conning, helmed by a character that has nothing to overcome and Zero weaknesses.  You can't invest much when it is impossible for the title character to be in real danger.  It's not much different than superman showing up at the end of JLA. It has no value because there are no stakes. Captain Marvel is simply a boring character played by a great actress who phones her performance. A more charismatic casting choice could have improved the film... Or you know just making giving a solo film to one of the already established wonderful MCU female heroes.

I also hope future movies include a ""patch"" that sees a ""Captain Marvel nerf"" just to keep things interesting, but at the same time, I enjoy watching action sequences of her overpowering everything in her way. this film is like a cheese platter; the Brie almost saves it, but in the end it's just an average appetizer to the main course that is End Game.",negative
"The movie that broke Rotten Tomatoes.nnIt should be a fairly easy fix - make an app to check in at the theater (verified GPS), and/or make audience ""reviewers"" submit photos of their ticket stubs before reviewing.nnI can understand the (current) 79% critic rating - ""it's a superhero movie"" much?

Captain Marvel is a good superhero movie, but it's a GREAT Marvel movie. It manages to set up SHIELD's mission and the Avengers while also setting up the COSMIC aspects of Marvel for ""Phase 4"".nnIn my opinion, the critics missed the mark on the villain of the story.  The OBVIOUS villain WAS underwhelming and underpowered, merely the tired old sensei gone bad trope.  However, the actual villain of the story was much more subtle - it wasn't Yon-Rogg, the Skrulls, Ronin, the Supreme Intelligence, or the Kree.nnBrie Larson is fantastic.  After browsing through critical reviews, I feel they missed the point.  ""Vers"" is a amnesiac (brainwashed?) human turned Kree special ops soldier.  As Vers, Larson shows us the soldier as well as her internal conflict.  As she is comes face to face with this conflict on Earth, Larson continues to morph into who she is meant to become - Carol Danvers. nnCaptain Marvel will return to the screen in just under two months in Avengers:Endgame.  I'm CERTAIN we'll get to see Carol Danvers now that she's truly become a ""noble warrior hero"".nnI can't wait for Brie Larson to lead the charge into the larger Marvel Multiverse.",positive

"Yes, this bizarre feature was written by John Sayles. Shot in Toronto, it's yet another '80s era feature about the dangers of the urban jungle, where the police fear to go and the homeless and the criminal classes are the only inhabitants. Into this mix comes the myth of Wild Thing, a feral young man raised by a bag lady after his parents were murdered by a dirty cop on the take (Maury Chaykin) and Chopper, the local crime lord (Robert Davi). Stir in the local do-gooders (priest Sean Hewitt and clueless social worker Kathleen Quinlan), and you have a recipe for some rather unexciting action sequences. Davi is the standout amongst the cast, and cinematographer Rene Verzier does a pretty good job. Otherwise this is a rather lumpen action pic that won't satisfy action fans and will leaves Sayles' admirers slack-jawed.",negative

Not as good as Black Panther, Ragnarok, or First Iron Man; but on par with the other non Avengers flicks. I do have one observation which is bothering me. The acting. The lead actress Larson (she is an Oscar winner from what I understand) came across as completely flat. Like a Cola without carbonation. Not sure if she was directed to act that way, or it's her? I found all of the supporting actors good to great. Judd Law was great as were the other two females in the flick ( Chan and Benning). But the lead.....a bit wooden. Otherwise a fun movie.",negative

"While it may not be his most laugh-packed film, MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE stands as one of Charley Chase's most satisfying farce comedies, twenty minutes of clever sight gags, nicely choreographed physical comedy, and amusing quips (rendered via title card, of course) all based on a wacky and wildly implausible premise. We're told up top that this is ""a story of homely people-- a wife with a face that would stop a clock --and her husband with a face that would start it again."" Soon we meet buck-toothed Charley Moose and his wife Vivien, who has an enormous nose. But there's no point in discussing plausibility when our plot hinges on such a patently unbelievable series of interconnected coincidences: i.e., first, that Charley would have his overbite corrected the very day his wife would have her nose fixed, second, that each spouse would keep their respective cosmetic surgeries secret from the other, and third, that when bumping into each other in public afterward, Charley and Vivien wouldn't recognize each other. Sounds like a bit of a stretch, doesn't it? Multiple stretches is more like it. Clearly, we're in the world of farce here and just have to roll with the silly plot twists, so as long as you can relax and forget about plausibility you're likely to enjoy this short.<br /><br />MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE gets off to a leisurely start as the various complications of the story are established, but things pick up once Charley and Vivien have ""met"" and made a date to attend a party together at the home of Charley's dentist. They each rush home excitedly, enter separately and are at first unaware of each other's presence. (Mr. & Mrs. Moose appear to be quite wealthy, incidentally, as they live in a mansion the size of a luxury hotel.) There follows a beautifully timed sequence somewhat reminiscent of Buster Keaton's THE NAVIGATOR in which husband and wife dash about the house without ever quite meeting up face-to-face. And once they arrive at the party the comedy really kicks into high gear as Charley is forced to dance with gawky wallflower Gale Henry. Henry, an estimable player in her own right who starred in many short comedies dating back to 1914, is hilarious as the dance partner who brings great vigor but little grace to her dancing. There's also an elegant cinematic touch during this sequence, when the camera pans down to show us only the shoes of Charley, Gale, Vivien and Vivien's dance partner, yet we're able to follow precisely what's happening between the principles by watching their feet.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Charley and Vivien the party they're attending is raided, and from there on the complications multiply when they manage to escape the police dragnet and return home. When Charley realizes that his newly-prettified wife was attempting to step out with another man he resolves to each her a lesson . . . while conveniently forgetting, of course, that he was attempting to do the very same thing. The last few minutes of this film offer some of Chase's funniest physical comedy, capped with a good sight gag for the punchline. MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE leaves the viewer with a warm glow, and surely ranks with the most amusing comedies produced by the prolific, sadly underrated Charley Chase.",positive

"Loved the movie overall. I felt there were strong underlying messages, but maybe not the ones I'd like to see as a woman. For instance, the music. Don't get me wrong, I love No Doubt, but was that the right song for Captain Marvel's break-out moment!? I felt it made the moment seem girly and almost childish. Male characters get amazing songs for those moments. She was wearing a NIN shirt for a quarter of the movie, and you come out with that? nI would have also liked to see a strong father figure in her life. Instead of her dad telling her she couldn't do something, maybe her dad being supportive and telling her to keep getting back up and trying would have been a better message.  Maybe having a good relationship with her father (and having that be threatened by her enemies) could have made the character more believable as well. Even when she tries to summon some emotion when relating to the little girl in the movie, she comes off as flat and unfeeling. Brie pulls off Captain Marvel without a hitch, but what she didn't pull off was connecting with the audience as a human and fallible being. Maybe it was her acting, maybe it was the script or director. The result was a character with an undetectable arc, with the exception of the acquisition of some power. I wanted a more dynamic character. Give me a little Jessica Jones or The Supreme Being, Leeloo.  Make her character more believable. A woman who is vulnerable at times is more realistic.  I'm sorry Hollywood, but vulnerable doesn't equal weak. Even Superman had vulnerabilities. Trying to shelf that in an effort to push a feminist agenda left the human side of Captain Marvel feeling like flat soda. nOn a positive note, Brie really pulled off the physical aspects of the role very well. The costume design was spot on. Can't wait for the new Avengers movie, and perhaps a chance to get to love this character more.",controversial

It starts out well enough. the opening scene was actually pretty tense, but from there it's all downhill. I can see that the filmmakers were trying to do something different with this movie, but by doing so, they took all the enjoyment out of watching it. Those choices combined with the ""C.S.I"" editing, use of music and montage, lack of suspense, scares, or humor really drag this film down. There's too much foreshadowing and to many ""subtle"" clues, so when the first twist arrives early on, you already know how the movie is going to end.

"To put it simply the movie is forgettable. And that has been a first for me with Marvel movie. This was the scenario that I was worried about where a movie with no substance is used push other movies. To be fair the feminist messaging in the marketing makes more sense after you see the movie because it does try to inspire young women. nnBut it feels forced and there is a lot of empty posturing. In the end Captain Marvel stands embodying the worst attributes of the male character: chauvinism and meaningless stoicism. And the shameless use of little children to sell tickets is deplorable. It feels the people at Disney looked at Wonder Woman and thought that getting girls to the movie theatre sells tickets. That is why they literally asked people to bring in girls to watch the movie. But that is not the case. nnBrie Larson is constantly wooden and you simply do not see the character struggle at any point. At no point is she confused by her surroundings, her powers, the odds. She is a character plodding from one point to another in the most shittiest adaptation of the Bourne Identity. She has no memory of her past and her reaction of recovering tidbits is little more than disinterest. Its like she absolutely isn't allowed to be even slightly inconvenienced. Is that the message you want to give little girls? That its not OK to have weakness and not show emotions when troubled? How well did it  turn out for the boys this was tried on? nnIn the end this movie is not even necessary to get the whole picture for the MCU and doesn't mean anything to the overarching storyline. I don't recommend watching this movie. I wanted to watch Alita but my friends were stupid and wrong. Make better friends.",controversial

"So to preface this I have been a Carol Danvers fan ever since I was a kid and saw her on X-Men the animated series, not to mention that awkward date she had with Spiderman in the comics.  So let's start off by saying was this movie good... Yes it was everything you expect from a marvel movie. Was it revolutionary no, but then again neither was black panther. The movie does suffer slightly from the mystery they're trying to keep going for avengers end game, but the same can be said about ant man and wasp (for the record this was one of my favorite find in the franchise so far). When looking at reviews I saw allot of people complain about Larsons portrayal seeming wooden but I mean she has more personality than other more know characters shown in this type of movie, especially for someone with severe memory loss. But the surprise twist involving the skrulls was a nice  change for comic book fans who thought they knew the Story going in.

"I've rented and watched this movie for the 1st time on DVD without reading any reviews about it. So, after 15 minutes of watching I've noticed that something is wrong with this movie; it's TERRIBLE! I mean, in the trailers it looked scary and serious!<br /><br />I think that Eli Roth (Mr. Director) thought that if all the characters in this film were stupid, the movie would be funny...(So stupid, it's funny...? WRONG!) He should watch and learn from better horror-comedies such as:""Fright Night"", ""The Lost Boys"" and ""The Return Of the Living Dead""!

""Resident Evil"" (horror) or ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" (comedy) I can watch over and over again and still enjoy! But this...!<br /><br />How bad can a script and a director be??? This bad. Here are the awful scenes in chronological order:<br /><br />In the early scenes we see Henry, who doesn't realize his dog lying on the ground with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and dead-glazed stare is dead!<br /><br />The movie doesn't explain anything about the blonde long-haired kid who like to bite people.<br /><br />And my answer to Marcy's unanswered question (""What's wrong with the woods?"") is ""nothing"". The script has that bearded guy warn them about the woods just for ""suspense"".<br /><br />Then the ""smartest"" of the 5-pack, Bert, almost gives us an example of how to start a forest fire. He meets now-infected Henry who begs for help and from here on the movie wants to break the record in using the ""F-word"". Bert starts to freak out because Henry looks awfully ill. Bert:""Don't make me shoot you!"" (he forgets to add: ""...with my BB gun!"")<br /><br />Bert heads back to the cabin but how about that? He meets Marcy and Jeff who were having sex, but now suddenly decide to go out for a walk! Marcy wisely takes out the unguarded campfire Bert had started earlier (A moment of clarity for a change?) Bert doesn't mention a word about Henry because the fool thinks he has killed him with his BB gun.<br /><br />Later, as the Five Estupidos sit around their campfire, another weirdo shows up with his dog. (Maybe that's what the warning about the woods is all about? It's filled with weirdos...and their dogs!?) They let him sit with them only because he has a huge bag filled with cannabis. (Their brains are completely intoxicated! No wonder why they are all so DUMB!) This is the last time we'll see this forgettable character...alive!<br /><br />Henry shows up at their cabin, (NOTE: He was lying all the time a few yards from their cabin!!!) looking worse, almost like a zombie, covered in goo! He says he needs a doctor. But the Young Einsteins refuse to help the poor sucker. He gets into their unlocked truck which of course also has its key in the ignition. Henry almost seems smart enough to drive the Hell away from there but instead starts puking blood all over the dashboard, seats and windows. The Fantastic Five come out running, armed with: a BB Gun, a knife, a baseball bat (*huh? Ever tried playing baseball in the middle of the woods???), a poker, and a (insecticide?) spray-can, ready to combat the single, unarmed and terribly sick man. (clever script!) Bert manages to kill the car with one single shot of his BB Gun, which is only possible in the mind of director Eli Roth. ""What else am I supposed to do?"" Bert yells in his defense. Jeff and Paul try to knock Henry down with their bat and poker but miss and crash the truck's windows instead. Henry walks up to the dumb girls who say: ""He's coming towards us!"" (Thanks for the info, dumb broads, I can see that! But I don't think he wants to do you any harm!) Marcy sprays in his eyes, making Henry yelp! And our ""hero"" Paul touches Henry's arm with a burning log from the campfire, which they recklessly left burning while they were INSIDE the cabin! (Where has all that wisdom gone? I guess the cannabis had started to take its toll!:-) Henry turns into The Human Torch and runs away, screaming.<br /><br />The following day, Bert and Jeff head out for a mechanic. And Marcy decides to ""go for help"" all by herself, in the woods, as Paul stays behind with Karen...Doesn't that sound idiotic? Marcy could have stayed with Karen and Paul because Jeff and Bert were already ""going for help""!<br /><br />I skip my comments now to how we suddenly see Marcy in a CANOE rowing over a huge and winding river! How did she get a canoe? Does she even know where she's going!? Anyway, she goes to the riverbank and finds a very big and seemingly abandoned cabin and, like in most horror movies, walks inside the cabin saying:""Hello? Is anyone there?"" Bert suddenly pops up from behind a furniture and scares her (and me at first). And along comes Jeff, as well. How did THEY get here!? Did they swim across the river??? Do you see how brainless the script is!?<br /><br />Deputy Winston meets Paul at the cabin. He somehow doesn't notice the blood on their truck. This happens around 35 minutes of viewing and I have decided to stop torturing myself anymore and popped the DVD out. (Before I take my own eyes out!...Now, THAT's funny!)<br /><br />If you liked this movie, do yourself a favor and watch ""Fright Night"", ""The Lost Boys"", or ""The Return of The Living Dead"". Then you'll see they are MORE entertaining than this...thing. Even the ""Toxic Avenger part 2"", which is also a lousy film, is way MORE funnier than ""Cabin Fever"".",negative
"Castle of Blood is a good example of the quality work in the horror genre being turned out in Italy in the 60s. The film has all of the right elements - old dark house, atmosphere, a decent story, and Barbara Steele. Steele makes most any film worth seeing.<br /><br />The story concerns a haunted castle. People have visited, but none have returned. Our hero makes a wager that he can spend the night in the castle and return to collect his winnings. But, the night he visits is a special night. It's the night each year when the dead return to relive their deaths.<br /><br />The only flaw I see in the movie is the running time. It almost feels padded. There is a large portion of the first act where literally nothing happens. Our hero stumbles around in the dark finding nothing of interest. But once he does find something, the movie picks up and become quite enjoyable.<br /><br />Castle of Blood is a definite must for Steele fans and fans of Italian Gothic horror in general.",positive
"Lars Von Triers Europa is an extremely good film. How's that? Von Trier has a very stylized way to tell a story, at least he did have with Europa. To me the whole film was like an experience even if I did see it on a small television screen. Even with all the tricks, in my opinion, this film is the most complete, REAL and moving piece of cinema then most of the films on the top 250 list. I also think it is perhaps the scariest, the most gothic and complete film around. All right there are other good ones too, but this one is my favorite. The final scene is one of the most harrowing scenes ever.",positive

"Admirable but weak James Bond film mainly because both the hero (Bond) and villain (Blofeld) were seriously miscast. Lazenby is too big and innocent looking to play Bond. He looks and acts more like the good-natured but dim-witted sidekick in a police action movie. The director and writer try to establish his credibility, but his saying of lines like ""Royal Baluga, North of the ..."" just aren't effective in establishing him as this worldly and suave rogue. Savalas doesn't do a bad job, but his characterization and behavior is more fitting of a mob gangster. The best portrayed characters of the movie are those of Tracy and her father. But the performances by those actors when sharing the screen with Lazenby only serve to emphasize his deficiencies as an actor. This movie is too long (140 mins.) for a Bond film and doesn't offer any excitement until Bond's mountain escape, where it begins to pick up. This film tries very hard, but falls short. Many Bondian elements are present and the climatic battle is top notch, but I always get a sense of something missing when watching this one.",negative
"I am a professional musician who was inspired nearly 20 years ago to begin playing guitar after hearing Jimmy Page on Led Zeppelin II. While I don't play in the same genre or style, the impact of that man has been huge. Now, nearly 20 years later I finally got to see something more than the not-so-good The Song Remains the Same. Again, I have seen SO many bands perform, some small - some the current 'masters.' No band, no where, no way has EVER been able to pull off the magic that you can actually taste by watching this DVD. <br /><br />Robert Plant can be a bit much at times, and you can nearly sense Page's annoyance for him forgetting lyrics, but that didn't matter I guess - especially for the era. Bonham's genius shines more on this DVD then on any album with Zeppelin, the Band of Joy or Lord Sutch. JPJ is pretty ordinary - but the magic of this DVD is how well the four of them perform together. The world loved to imagine that they were into black magic(k) etc. - that was only a matter of interest to Page. The magic (notice I say this a lot), is that this DVD captures a rare glance to the rawness of 4 young boys who can play brilliantly, no matter how sloppy they are actually playing. It didn't matter. <br /><br />A quick breakdown. The first of the two DVD's is where the true magic is. You should be able to sense the power and rawness Zep had in their early days. By the end of the second DVD Page is struggling with his sanity during the Knebworth songs. (It's no secret that by this time he was severely addicted to heroin). So, I'd recommend the first disk to ANY music lover, and the second for the only true Zeppelin fan.<br /><br />I may be going too far here for some guitarists, but I would say after watching this, Page is certainly more creative and inventive than Hendrix. Yup, I said it. And if you disagree - watch the DVD.",positive

"It's difficult for Marvel movies, now that they've built such a good reputation for themselves. That being said, this movie did not live up to that reputation. The story was not as compelling as I'd hoped and relied too much on 90's nostalgia. Brie Larson's character was sort of bland- not what I expected from Marvel's greatest heroine. And there wasn't enough action to make up for the other shortcomings. It seems as though this was another Marvel movie primarily designed to set up an even bigger blockbuster.",negative

"I loved it! Captain Marvel is a great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe; you get a better understanding of how S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Avenger Initiative began, a very cute Stan Lee cameo, 90's rock and pop music (my fave), and Brie Larson's excellent performance. All of the characters worked well together, especially with Goose the cat. I fear that some of the callbacks to 90's tech will get lost with viewers born in the 90s but the nostalgia among the older viewers will be enough for the payoff. I loved the inspiration built around Carol's life and it reminds little kids and big kids like myself to get up and keep going.",positive
"I am finding that I get less and less excited about Disney's sequels to movies. Yes, I do understand that the budget for the direct to video movies are not the same, but these movies don't even try. Some examples are Hunchback II and Tarzan and Jane. If anyone has seen the previews for Stitch-The Movie, you will see my point. But I digress, this movie reaffirms my point. The animation is sloppy, the story lines resemble Saturday morning cartoons, and not all of the original voices are there. I was very disappointed not to hear Michael J. Fox's voice. It was so glaringly obvious that the person doing Milo's voice was trying to sound like Fox, but didn't come close to succeeding. <br /><br />If it says anything, my children ages 10 and 6 didn't even sit through the whole movie.",negative
"Hidden Frontier is notable for being the longest running internet-based Star Trek fan series. While the production quality is not on a par with fan productions like Starship Exeter, or New Voyages, Hidden Frontier concentrates largely on story, and in that regard it does very well indeed.<br /><br />Hidden Frontier has no physical sets; instead actors are filmed against a greenscreen, and the backgrounds inserted digitally. One of Hidden Frontier's greatest achievements is the sheer volume of work they have produced. One of the ways in which this is achieved is by inserting the virtual sets at the time of filming, instead of in post-production. While this does save a great deal of time, it's also worth noting that the quality of the resultant footage is not as high as if it had been produced in post-production, though it still serves its purpose. <br /><br />While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, Hidden Frontier is well worth a shot, though you might be best to start off watching the third season, since this is where the producers really start to hit their stride.",positive

"For every fan of coming of age tales, this 3 hour adaptation of the<br /><br />Sarah Waters novel is pure fun. Cinematic nods to Baz Luhrman's<br /><br />kinetic style, as well as to all those prim and proper period pieces<br /><br />ever present on the BBC (where you're likely to have seen almost<br /><br />every prominent member of this cast). It's rather bawdy and over<br /><br />the top in spots, but that's just what the novel called for. The cast<br /><br />is appealing and, in the cases of Anna Chancellor and Hugh<br /><br />Bonneville, perfect. In the case of Rachel Sterling, as our heroine<br /><br />Nan, you simply must overlook the fact that she's far too pretty to<br /><br />ever be mistaken for a boy and run with it. It's a fantasy, after all. <br /><br />Some fans of the novel may be put out by the various changes in<br /><br />character (particularly that of Jodhi May's character, Florence), but<br /><br />the changes all work toward the greater good of this teleplay and<br /><br />provide an overall high quality entertainment value.",positive

Hated the overly-dramatic shaky cam during one of the conversations with the Skrull at the best friend's place.

"It explored human themes like abandonment, loss, failure, and death without giving up the Star Wars charm that we're used to. Again, it easily had the most plot, lore, and most thorough execution of any Star Wars to date- plenty of well-placed fanservice, and overall was like Star Wars if they ever decided to add a heavier, darker plot, more lore, and wanted to increase the characterization to something that wasn't just comedy banter and cheesy smiles. Again, not saying that's a bad thing. It explored the full extent of the universe. Star Wars has always been legendary level, but this took it to the next level and is the standard for the Sci-Fi/Fantasy genre to come: 10/10.",positive
"Speed which I believe is direct copy of the Hollywood movie Cellular (I haven't watched this one) gives an impression of a test match which is very exciting in first four days, but then gets in a very boring draw at the end. I have watched this movie today on 12th January 2008 on rented VCD. It's release date is 19th Oct 2007. But still fortunately for me I didn't know or heard much of this movie before except that it is a flop at box office. So in this situation when I watch the movie, I feel that this movie could have been a very good movie, but then the director again falls in the trap for Bollywood traditions and has wasted a very good chance.<br /><br />Off course as a Bhatt movie it must be copied from somewhere else. But now days it doesn't matter for me, if I haven't seen the original movie. I just found the main theme much similar to 'Nick of Time' and 'Badshah'. In the movie Sanjay Suri is shown an intelligence agent, but his wife thinks that he is a chef. This brings back the memory of 'True-Lies'. The only new part was the use if the phone. But that too I found out now is taken from movie Cellular. So when a movie is made with the mixture of so many other movies it's future is quite clear.<br /><br />The things I like about the movie is its pace. As the name suggest the things really happens fast, and there is not much time to think about in between the scenes. But this breaks in the last 20 minutes of so where the movie goes in traditional Bollywood style of Dhishum dhishum.<br /><br />The plot of the movie is also quite interesting. Three stories going parallel, one after the other. One of the kidnapping of Urmila, the other of the Zayed trying to help Urmila, and then the plan of murder of prime minister. These three stories gets mixed up naturally with each other as the movie continues.<br /><br />But then the very ordinary acting and unnecessary extra style has killed the spirit of the movie. Except Sanjay Suri, none other makes any impression. This goes even for Urmila, who is always promising in RGVs movies. Due to this ordinary acting some scenes doesn't really convey the feelings that director wanted. E.g. the scene at the end where Urmila leaves all hope and cut the phone, should have made a good impact. But instead we just wait for the end of that scene.<br /><br />Other than acting, some unnecessary love for style demoralizes the movie. Showing so cool villains is good for Hollywood movies not for Bollywood The background of London is also only for making style and not much intelligent advantage of this background can be seen. Especially at the end, all those dhishhum- dhishhum were utterly unnecessary. May be director has an impression that the climax in Hindi movies must have such fights. They look unrealistic, increase the length of the movie and make sure that the people are leaving theater before the movie ends.<br /><br />Over and all, I find the movie once watchable. If it is coming on TV or you can get it on rent its OK. But then again make sure that you have the remote and forward button handy. Next time, when the movie is on TV, you can safely watch other channels.",negative

"I saw this film on September 1st, 2005 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival that screens films for their Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ""...explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.<br /><br />This is a story of golf in the early part of the 20th century. At that time, it was the game of upper class and rich ""gentlemen"", and working people could only participate by being caddies at country clubs. With this backdrop, this based-on-a-true-story unfolds with a young, working class boy who takes on the golf establishment and the greatest golfer in the world, Harry Vardon.<br /><br />And the story is inspirational. Against all odds, Francis Ouimet (played by Shia LaBeouf of ""Holes"") gets to compete against the greatest golfers of the U.S. and Great Britain at the 1913 U.S. Open. Francis is ill-prepared, and has a child for a caddy. (The caddy is hilarious and motivational and steals every scene he appears in.) But despite these handicaps, Francis displays courage, spirit, heroism, and humility at this world class event.<br /><br />And, we learn a lot about the early years of golf; for example, the use of small wooden clubs, the layout of the short holes, the manual scoreboard, the golfers swinging with pipes in their mouths, the terrible conditions of the greens and fairways, and the play not being canceled even in torrential rain.<br /><br />This film has stunning cinematography and art direction and editing. And with no big movie stars, the story is somehow more believable.<br /><br />This adds to the inventory of great sports movies in the vein of ""Miracle"" and ""Remember the Titans.""<br /><br />FYI - There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past winners going back 70 years.",positive

"It was 1983 and I was 13. I watched Valley Girl on HBO one night when my parents were working. After it ended I wanted to talk with someone about it immediately. Turns out my best friend watched it too and it became our favorite movie. Every weekend after that we watched it until we could recite it. We woke her parents up late at night laughing hysterically. We began to worship the main character, Julie, played by the beautiful Deborah Foreman. I am not saying this is a great classic. Although it is for me personally. And I understand that the whole Valley Girl talk becomes annoying but that was the 80's. But deep down at the heart of the movie-it is a love story, and a familiar but good one. Girl meets boy and there are sparks from both sides, an instant connection. Julie's friends don't like him-he doesn't fit in, doesn't go to their school, doesn't have money. They like her better with her ex-boyfriend the football player even though he is a jerk. She makes the ultimate sacrifice-her own happiness for her friends' happiness. And she has these really cool supportive hippie parents. It is one of Nicholas Cage's first movies and his first starring role. One minute he is absolutely hilarious and the next incredibly touching and romantic. His friend Fred is pretty funny too. If you were a teenager in the 80's you will love this movie or at the very least it will bring back memories. It is no longer my favorite movie but it is still one of my favorites, probably in my top 10. I am eagerly awaiting it's release on DVD if they ever release it. You can go to Deborah Foreman's website to sign a petition to get it released on DVD and there are 2 soundtracks from the movie that are must haves if you like 80's music.",positive

This movie is an origin story, so I think that should be taken into consideration. Was there as much action as there was in the Avengers? No. But, I was okay with that. My only qualm is to those who complained about it shoving ""feminist/left agenda"" down your throat. I am a conservative and I didn't feel that way at all! Honestly, nowhere in the movie did I get that vibe. Yes, there was a scene where she had a flashback to a moment in her life where she was belittled by the military men around her, but that isn't that big of a deal... It took place in the military over 20 years ago. Stuff like that happened then. I don't know why some people are so up in arms about it.

"I watched this film without knowing anything about it whatsoever and found it similar thematically to Billy Elliott (2000). Both films are based around a troubled father/son relationship. In both films, the son does not want to follow his father down the mines and dreams of a better life away from their home town. Both sons face derision by their classmates and both have a strong female role model who teaches them.<br /><br />The major difference that I found between the films was that October Sky was an infinitely more interesting and touching film. Laura Dern puts in a moving performance and Chris Cooper plays the disapproving father very well as he went on to do in American Beauty (1999). Joe Johnston surprised me with his subtle directing, very different from his other directorial features such as Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001).<br /><br />",positive

Scenes that were supposed to be emotional left me feeling nothing as a viewer due to the poor script and storytelling. I can't tell if the character of ""Captain Marvel"" is supposed to be bland or if that was just the actress but I had no connection with her. The supporting cast did a great job, the young lady who is her childhood friend was amazing in every scene. If you are a Marvel fan watch it for the CGI and the backstory on Fury... but it will feel like a chore.",negative
This movie was great and fun to watch. Had some good action scenes (could've been better but not the worst) loved some of the music they put in. took Captain marvel a while to redeem herself but paid off in the end!

"Somewhere out there are countless fantastic stories, ideas and subsequent scripts for a phenomenal Star Wars film- Disney apparently isn't interested in utilizing any of them. Instead, the powers that be have tapped an individual who clearly despised the franchise and appeared bound and determined to deconstruct it at every turn. Aside from John Williams' score and one sequence set in the Big Bad's throne room, this was nearly a total bust.

"Spoiler begin The movie focuses on three friends, Samantha (Summer Phoenix), Chris (Nick Stahl), and Owen (Aaron Paul). The movie starts out with Sam and Owen as the drug addicts, and Chris, the track star, as the one who takes care of them. As things get increasingly worse at home for Chris, he asks Sam what the drug is like. Sam is out of rehab and sober by this point and tells him it makes everything better. Chris then catches up with Owen and they start using. It takes chris two times till he is a "" full time member"". After some trouble with a dealer and a confession to Sam, she gets in again. So begins the downward spiral for them. Chris od's when he breaks a promise to Sam (I want some of the movie to be a surprise). He dies, Sam gets in to college to be an Architect, and Owen gets arrested. so ends the story<br /><br />Spoiler ends. minor spoilers throughout<br /><br />Nick stahl is amazing. He will have an Oscar one day. His portrayal of Chris was Heartbreaking. He was the only one that felt real in the movie as far as drug use goes. Aaron Paul who played Owen acted as if he were on speed not heroin. Summer Phoenix was fine, she is talented but what can i say Nick Stahl stole the movie. His drugged eyes, his slow movements, everything was perfect. <br /><br />The writers needed to show withdrawls in the movie. That is a main reason why people don't want to quit. Other then that there are hilarious scenes (the mall scene, and the Backstreet boy scene,man Stahl nailed the reactions right on the head.), Touching, sad scenes (Like the scene between Sam and Chris in her bedroom after he gets beat up, i bawled, and the park scene.). It was realistic too. Like S am using again when Chris wanted to flush the drug down the toilet, and Chris using again after he goes to Own's, even though he had been clean for two weeks, the pull was too strong. it is all realistic. <br /><br />Watch the movie for a great cast, great music, and a semi- truthful account of drug addiction.",positive

Sure, the camerawork is shaky and off-center, the story is muddled and slow-paced, and every single character in the movie is repugnant and despicable, but PINK FLAMINGOS has a certain playful charm and brilliant satiric wit that no other movie can match.<br /><br />While this film is indeed an offensive one, reading descriptions of what goes on in the movie is much worse than actually seeing it.

It started off a little slow but really picked up quickly. nMost importantly, while the movie welcomed male fans and appreciated her male allies, there are jokes and moments in there that will only resonate with women. It's -0% made for women by women.nnAs a fan of Carol Danvers in the conics since her Ms. Marvel days, I felt that the writing was true to the essence of Carol. I've been rooting to see her in Civil War but understood that the pacing of the MCU would have meant her inclusion would've felt sudden and forced. I think this movie set her up for inclusion in Infinity War perfectly- she's the Superman of the MCU without the god complex, and with plenty of heart. nnHonestly, this movie touched me on a personal level. I'm so happy to see a female hero just living her life with no romantic interest used to make her more relatable or be a weakness used against herĂ˘"" her love interest is her best friend and the self made family she has on earth. She has a female mentor. The movie really speaks to the female experience of being consistently told you're not allowed or able to do something, and it shows her fail, but instead of proving those people right when she's injured or messes up, she just keeps going and growing. As Samuel L. Jackson points out in an interview I saw- Carol was a bad ass long before she ever had powers.",negative
"Solid 7/10. Not one of Marvel's best, but far and away from their worst. For an intergalactic plot it felt very focused and centralized, which I appreciated. A much better origin story for a godlike hero than Thor was. Villain twist was refreshing. The action scenes weren't shot very well, but the ending sequences were pretty spectacular, gave a good taste of just how powerful Carol is. The 90s references weren't too annoying though I question some of the song choices, it definitely wasn't on point like Guardians was. It'll be nice to see Brie grow into the role and truly flesh out who Carol is, if she can stomach the stupid drama the movie has attracted. I don't think this movie really shows us who Captain Marvel really is, but there are glimpses of what could be. Also the movie does have feminist undertones, and for the most part they're very strong moments. I imagine it will resonate with quite a lot of people who cut through the drama and go see the movie.",controversial

He wasn't the badass we have seen before and it wasn't like he was a wet behind the years agent. He had been a military colonel, a spy during the cold war, and a current high level SHIELD agent.

I'm a guy and I can also see why people are saying it had a feminine agenda.

"The concept of having Laurel & Hardy this time in the role of chimney sweepers works out surprisingly hilarious. It guarantees some funny situations and silly antics, from especially Stan Laurel of course as usual.<br /><br />The movie also has a subplot with a nutty professor who is working on a rejuvenation formula. It doesn't really sound like a logical mix of story lines and incoherent but both plot lines blend in perfectly toward the memorable ending. It's still a bit weird but its funny nevertheless, so it works for the movie.<br /><br />The supporting cast of the movie is surprising good. Sam Adams is great as the stereotypical butler and Lucien Littlefield goes deliciously over-the-top as the nutty professor.<br /><br />The movie is filled with some excellent timed and hilarious constructed sequences, which are all quite predictable but become hilarious to watch nevertheless thanks to the way they are all executed.

"Disappointing.  I'm glad I watched it but I doubt I'll do so a second time.  What could/should have been a great film to lead into Endgame feels like a lazily written project just farted out with a sense of entitlement to praise because it's another Marvel movie.  The first 20 minutes are an exposition dump, taking what should have been a rigorously explored set of plot points and simply rattling them off to the audience.  The same thing could have been accomplished in 2 minutes of narration with the same effect.  The fight choreography, which should have been one of the strongest points of the film, was entirely underwhelming.  Elements of conspiracy and mystery were interesting in the story, but ultimately were introduced at the exspense of themes the movie clearly wanted to introduce but barely touched on.  Danvers is supposed to have struggled her whole life to prove herself, being a woman in a male-dominated field.  We get brief flashes that ultimately amount to nothing.  If they were taken out of the movie, the plot would be entirely unchanged.  Ideas are introduced, barely touched, and then dropped.  The climax of the movie is dull, too fast, and again quite underwhelming.  What could have been a great origin story for Fury and the establishment of SHIELD was lazily slapped together and frankly just seems to retroactively hurt the MCU.  Here's hoping they do a MUCH better job with this character in Endgame, because this was a lackluster introduction.",negative

The CGI definitely doesn't overcome the plot or the characters, except for Nim, the fledgling creature who is a pet with definite attitude.

"This movie is a Social Justice Warriors wet dream. Every male character is whiny, stupid, egotistic, immature, irrational, or make the wrong decisions or not to be trusted. And guess what, the “new” Luke Skywalker has some of them traits too! The leaders in this movie are female, the protagonist an over-powered female (with little training). The people making sacrifices to save everyone? Overwhelmingly female apart from one character. And most are infallible. The days when men saved women? The roles are well and truly reversed in this movie. Not to mention the diversity, interracial relationships just for the sake of it (and also does not add to the movie), and the only joke when it came to racial issues was at the expense of white red headed male character when mentioning his “pasty"" skin tone. It was comical to see Chewbacca becoming conscious of being a meat eater (but not in the way they intended), and Luke Skywalker disgustingly milking a sea cow (there was absolutely no point in this). This is supposed be a galaxy far away, and yet you’re reminded of the war-profiteering and rich people being evil. Having animal rights issues thrown in there and a war general being a female with purple dyed purple hair and looks like she teaches gender studies. And we’re all set. The only thing I wasn’t surprised at was that Luke Skywalker didn’t come out as transgender or wasn’t accused by Kylo ren as being a “white male” as an insult. Oh and did I mention that white people are evil? For what it’s worth, I enjoyed it. The visuals are well and truly beautiful, and the action sequences are great. However, had it not had that, I don’t know what score I would have given it, because the writer is so politically driven with Feminism, Diversity, and anti-white male bias. The focus is lost. Lost that is, on telling a remarkable story that makes sense and doesn’t contain more plot holes than Swiss cheese. The character development is so bad that you simply do not care about any of the characters. Characters come and go, and you wonder not only who they are, but you don’t care either. Disney tried so hard to wipe the slate clean that even the Characters blatantly tell us to forget the past on BOTH sides of the war. Luckily, I’m not a huge Star Wars fan and I found some parts amusing that I shouldn’t. Something happens with Princess Leia that made some people including myself in the cinema laugh. Like wtf is going on here moment? otherwise I’d be completely gutted. Because what made Star Wars great, like the Jedi, the Luke Skywalker of old etc is not in this movie.",controversial

It has the same elements of ""Casablanca,"" but is set just before many of the characters would truly understand the seriousness of what was happening to their country (and the world) and the consequences of some of their own behavior. This adds a strong note of irony to the humor (we sense that one of the female characters has a radical change of hairstyle in her future). This is a film that you will not regret watching.",positive

She is by far the most sane resident watching while one man puts dead flies into another's soup. Ethel is then teased by one of the halfway house employees with a chocolate bar after he hits on the cost cutting measure of feeding the residents dog food. Ethel retaliates by strangling him with a wire noose on the stairs and then....well, you get the idea. If this all sounds like fun, it isn't. This film was poorly made with cheap effects and even worse acting. The characters are so wooden when delivering their lines that they should be standing out in front of a cigar store.

"Sadly this movie only has marvels 10 year legacy to thank for its merits at the box office. As an origin story it falls quite short of MCU standards, let's compare it to the first one, Iron man (2008), tony stark begins as a selfish ignorant and drunk play boy, after a life threatening event he is awoken to reality and the consequences of his ignorance who then proceeds to change everything about his life to be a better person and the movie finishes with him willing to sacrifice his life to stop the bad guy. In comparison carol danvers starts of as an impulsive soldier with very little self control and a very egotistical presence, she struggles to find her memories and finds out she's living a lie but the story ends with her quite simply gaining even more power and even less restraint. To nsummarize she is the same egotistical impulsive person as in nthe beginning. Unfortunately it seems the writers have focused on the wrong politics in this movie, a character who possess this magnitude of power shouldn't be unleashing it every chance they get, especially in an origin story.

The special effects were cartoonish at times, especially the scenes in space - the peak action scenes in the movie. Then the character development scenes were incredibly boring and unoriginal. Fill in the blanks and whatever one sentence explanation you can conceive for Carol Danver's background as a character works and is almost certainly more interesting than the movie's delivery. The acting of the lead actress is on par with a bad high school actor playing a perpetually angry person. Samuel L Jackson's acting was fine but his character, Nick Fury, was wrecked in this film (buffoonish old cat lady). Ronin was wrecked. S.H.I.E.L.D. was wrecked. The source material was heavily disrespected. Logical consistency was a non-factor. The dialogue ranged from empty to cringeworthy. The title character isn't even qualified to have the name ""Captain Marvel"". At no point is she even referred to by this name. Worst of all, at no point is the character qualified as heroic. She shows no relatable moral conviction or growth. It's a bad movie, and had it hadn't been backed by the same people, institutions, and money that backed this garbage, if critics were honest, even if they were fanatically politically aligned with the messaging of this film, they'd tell you it was utter garbage. Any competent person giving this film better than 3 stars is being dishonest. Even as a matter of taste there's no way this film deserves high ratings. Only the support of experienced veteran actors make this boring cringefest watchable one time through. Only respect for the other people I went to the movie with and the rest of the audience kept me from walking out or taking a nap half way through. Skip it if you haven't seen it. If you have, I'm sorry you were subjected to this.",negative

"Dennis Patrick plays a man who accidentally kills his daughter's boyfriend and then reveals his secret at a local bar. Joe (Peter Boyle), a bigot who is getting drunk there, at first takes it as a joke, but then the story is confirmed on the evening news. Instead of calling the cops or the like, Joe decides that, since the guy killed a hippie, they must be kindred spirits! He blackmails the man into becoming his pal. At first, the film seemed harsh and judgemental, but, as it revealed itself, it actually became quite a complex portrait of the current society. Yes, I think it does exaggerate a bit, but in amusing ways that don't really detract from the power of its messages. Susan Sarandon debuted in this film, and it's a shock to see how pretty she was around 23. Well worth seeing.",positive

"Pretty funny stuff. Charlie was still working towards his peak when he made this rather daring short about soldiers in the trenches of World War One. Daring because, after all, the war was still going on and this was a comedy about a serious business.<br /><br />The gags are amusing without being either hilarious or tear jerking. One successful scene follows another, as Chaplin and his comrades try to sleep in a bunker that is knee deep in water. (That's where we got the term ""trench foot"" from.) Probably the most ludicrous episode has Chaplin disguised as a tree and foiling any number of German soldiers as they try to execute an Allied soldier caught behind the lines. Edna Purviance, Chaplin's main squeeze at the time, is a woman who cooperates with the Americans and is saved from execution too.<br /><br />Chaplin would go on to do funnier and more ambitious things but this is better than most of his shorts during this early period.",positive

"This is not a great movie, but it is not a bad movie. Whoever stated that this film felt like a trip back in the past to Phase 1, they hit the nail on the head. The story felt weak in parts and strong in others. The beginning was quite good as well as the ending. My issue with the film was the middle. It felt as if the story had a hard time making the fish out of water story line and it did feel forced. I found all of the retconning of storylines to connect Captain Marvel to the Avengers good and bad. nnMoving the story to the 1990s felt like a safe move. This could have been a great post Thanos' finger snap moment for Captain Marvel to show her chops and introduce the fallout to other parts of the galaxy and cosmos. This film had the opportunity of being a film that would have allowed a powerful and strong woman to be representative of the will of all humanity, but it lost the opportunity. It was lost on trying to force an ideal of politics on the audience. Neither Skrulls or Kree are friends of Earth, but they decided to take a political approach and ruin what could have been an exceptional prelude to Secret Wars and other interesting intrigue. If the MCU continues on pushing politics into its films, I will probably just have to drop off the bandwagon. nnThere are two parts that ruined the film for me. The issues of trolls giving fake reviews is horrible. There is no reason why this should be done and ruins the honesty and integrity of the ability for people to give honest reviews. The other is by using metaphors for our current political conflicts into the film. Over politicalization is not going to help in the long run.",controversial
"I was surprised at the low rating this film got from viewers. I saw it one late night on TV and it hit the spot - I actually think it was back in 1989 when it first appeared. Yet I remember it pretty well, with a nice twist or two, and an interesting ambiance on a windmill farm. Michael Pollard looks suitably seedy for his role which pretty much sums up the unfulfilled early promise of his career, and everyone else plays it pretty straight ahead. I definitely recommend it as a rental, although some of the themes, which might have seemed a bit edgy in 1989, now may seem tame, which is a shame, considering that contemporary ""edginess"" is often just used as a necessary marketing tool, sort of like clamoring just to get noticed.",positive

"I so wanted to like this movie, but it just crushed my expectations and left me disappointed. The CGI is of the standard we now expect form Marvel, but not the acting standards of their lead character. Brie Larson's acting was so bland the I wanted to add salt and pepper for a better flavor. Even my date who is a die hard Marvel fan who generally liked the movie said felt that it was very childish and was not up to standards but liked it any way because of the Cat! The story was flat and Brie's acting was flatter. The support actors were good, Samuel L. Jackson, was one of my redeeming points, and for once I related to the villain turned good guy played by Ben Mendelsohn. When your supporting cast does a better acting job and has a better character development than the main character, there is not much more left to say. Even  Kristen Stewart was more expressive and emotional in Twilight than Brie in this movie. The funny part is that the people in the theater were more existed about the Mid credit scene than they were for the whole movie, plus that one part with the cat. To sum it up, like my date said, 'people actually paid to watch the Mid credit scene, rather than the movie'. From India bwt, our tolerance of movies with non existent stories but with good CGI is very high, but this was exceptional.",negative
"Love Jones cleverly portrays young African-American men and women in a clear, positive, realistic sense. I feel that all of the actors and actresses were magnificent and really did a great job at capturing the mood. Nia Long and Larenz Tate worked well together and I hope to see more work from the two of them. As a matter of fact all of the actors/actresses did such a fine job it would be great to see another romantic-comedy from them. This movie can be compared to most any well-written, romantic comedy. If you have not seen this movie already I strongly recommend that you do, it can definitely give you another perspective on life and love.",positive

"It begins with several of the principles on a stage run to Albuquerque. Gabby Hayes(Juke, sounds like Duke) is the driver and begins his usual tirade against women in general, with his girlfriend Pearl being an exception. He then relates a garbled version of the biblical story of Samson to justify his retention of long whiskers against the wishes of Pearl, who is the town barber, no less, and who claims if everyone followed his example, she would be out of business. This point will return to dominate the last scene in the film. Gabby seems an irritation to some reviewers, but is a definite plus to this one. It's too bad he wasn't in more of the better Randoph Scott westerns to help lighten up Randy's usual iron-jawed demeanor. Also on this stage are Randy(Cole Armin), his future wife(Cathrine Craig , as Celia Wallace), whom he is getting acquainted with, and a little girl(Myrtle), to whom he soon becomes a hero when he rescues her from the runaway stage after it is held up by henchman of Randy's wheelchair-bound uncle John Armin(George Cleveland), who essentially runs the town.<br /><br />Randy soon learns that his uncle, and by extension, himself, is not exactly popular among the town folk. He does, however, quickly form a useful friendship with Gabby. After he learns that uncle John was responsible for the stage holdup of his business competitor, Celia Wallace, and the associated murder, he demands that uncle John return the money and decides to work for Celia and her brother Ted(Russell Hayden), instead of for uncle John. <br /><br />As his rival's prospects rise, uncle John decides to plant an informant(Barbara Britton, as Letty Tyler) in the Wallace office, to keep him informed as to when they are delivering ore from the mines to town so that he can sabotage their run. When this doesn't work, he resorts to the draconian tactic of staging an arson of his own office, for which Randy is blamed. Unfortunately, when the fire was discovered, Randy was in Letty's apartment confronting her with suggestive evidence that she was tipping off uncle John. Myrtle and Letty testify that he was in the apartment when the fire was discovered. This puts him and Letty in the dog house with Celia(his apparent beau) and Ted(who hopes to woo Letty). This news also ends Uncle John's trust in Letty as an informant, and he suggests she leave town. Instead, she switches sides and tells the Wallaces why Randy was in her apartment. Uncle John tries once again to sabotage their ore run, and when that fails, there is a general shootout in town. You can guess the results.<br /><br />The plot is well constructed and executed, with complicated relationships between the principles, and with a variety of obstacles for Randy to overcome, with the sometimes aid of his associates. At least, Randy was spared the necessity of bringing his uncle to justice. Uncle John had a choice to avoid assassination, but arrogantly trusted that a woman wouldn't have the guts to carry out her threat. The presence of Hayes and two beautiful wholesome single women, as well as little Myrtle, much helped to lighten the otherwise tense atmosphere in this battle for survival, as uncle John put it.<br /><br />It seems odd that Barbara Britton, the ""bad"" girl, gets top female billing over Catherine Craig, Randy's love interest. Barbara's on camera time was much more limited. <br /><br />Those who grew up on the Lassie TV series featuring George Cleveland as ""Gramps"" will be surprised to find him playing such a mean controlling villain. We may wonder if his wheelchair-bound status has a bearing on this persona. This leaves him with few options for making a living in the wild West. Without apparent family to help support him(except Randy), he can't afford to have some upstart beat him out of the most profitable business in town. On the other hand, from his conversations, he probably achieved his status as the town ""boss"" before becoming wheelchair-bound.",positive
"Tourist Trap (1979) is an entertaining horror movie from the late 70's, the movie is about a bunch of young friends who get stranded on an old deserted lane by a creepy old waxwork museum.<br /><br />The owner of the museum seems like a strange but harmless old man, but things take a very nasty turn when members of the young group start getting killed off, who is responsible for the murders, is it old man Slausen or is it his collection of creepy mannequins who seem to be alive and hungry for blood!!!!

"The thirties horror films that are best remembered are always the likes of Dracula and Frankenstein; and there's a very good reason for that, but there were a number of smaller but nevertheless excellent productions, and The Invisible Ray is certainly one of them. The plot is not particularly original and similar plots have been seen many times before (even way back in 1936) but the way that everything is put together is certainly very imaginative and director Lambert Hillyer has created a very nifty little original horror film. The plot focuses on the good hearted Dr Janos Rukh; a man who has discovered a way to recreate the history of the Earth. His discovery leads him to believe that there may be an unknown radioactive element somewhere in Africa and so he sets off along with a team of esteemed colleagues to find it. However, tragedy strikes while on the expedition and the good doctor ends up becoming exposed to the element; which makes him glow in the dark, and also sends him mad...<br /><br />The biggest draw of the film is undoubtedly the fact that it stars the two biggest horror stars of its day - Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi, and both give excellent performances. Karloff really shows what a good actor he is and his character has plenty of meat for Karloff to impress with. Bela Lugosi has a role which is extremely different from what we're used to seeing him in, and it's a great performance from him also; it's nice to see a bit of versatility from Lugosi. The film does get off to a rather slow start; but things soon start to pick up. The second half of the film is the best and that's really when the film gets exciting and Karloff gets a chance to shine (literally). The film does not put its focus on big special effects and largely relies on the actions of the central character to keep things interesting; and it does work very well. The film remains interesting throughout and boils down to a very decent climax that wraps everything up nicely. Overall, The Invisible Ray may not be one of the very best horror films of the thirties; but it's a very good one and comes recommended.",positive

"Sporting a title seemingly more suitable for a Looney Tunes featurette than a grisly giallo, ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" (1972) is nonetheless a Grade A thriller from horror maestro Lucio Fulci. In this one, someone has been strangling the preteen boys in a rural, southern Italian village and, typical for these gialli, there are many suspects. There's Barbara Bouchet (Patrizia), looking more scrumptiolicious than you've ever seen her, a rich girl hiding out after a drug scandal; Florinda Bolkan (Martiara), the local epileptic voodoo woman; her witchcraft-practicing beau; Giuseppe, the local idiot; the sweet-faced priest; his dour mother; and on and on. The film features some unusually violent set pieces, including a chain whipping of one of the main characters in a graveyard (one of the most realistically bloody sequences that I've ever seen) and a nifty dukeout when the killer is ultimately revealed. The film's bursts of violence compensate for the fact that there are no real scares or suspense to speak of. Still, this giallo fascinates, with its unusual rural backdrop, unsettling child murders, oddball characters, and freaky score by Riz Ortolani. The film has been beautifully photographed in what I presume to be Monte Sant'Angelo, near the Adriatic in southern Italy (at least, that town's police force is thanked in the closing credits). And while subtitling would've made this fine-looking DVD work even better (the American slang doesn't convince in this rural Italian setting), Anchor Bay is to be thanked for another job well done. Oh...that title DOES eventually make perfect sense, too!",positive

You may not agree with Brie Larson's politics, and I don't, but I probably wouldn't see many movies if I only attended movies where I agreed with the main actors' politics.  I stay away from movies with overtly racist or leftist messages, this isn't one of those.  I saw it the day it came out and then again two days later - I enjoyed it.",controversial
"Honestly, a very poor attempt at competing with Wonder Woman. The pacing is pretty bad in the film; I was checking the time more than I'd have liked. Politics aside, this movie just fell flat. Brie Larson gave what is possibly the worst performance of any marvel superhero film. Her character never encountered a challenge that she didn't immediately and easily overcome. Sam Jackson's Nick Fury was only included for comedic purposes, which is a missed opportunity for him to get more time in the spotlight. The really only enjoyable part of the movie for me was when Captain Marvel flies for the first time.

She tries to be a good role model to little girls and a good friend to youg women. She adores Samuel Jackson as a father-figure and is kind to him. She does punch her mother-figure in the face but with good reason, so that's OK. Also, bear in mind that she doesn't blow her ex to pieces even though she's mad at him and has the means, the motive, and the opportunity. So, she isn't quite a badass even when she kicks ass which she does very well without messing up her make-up, her hair, or her nails. I expect that all girls from 2 to at least 22 will just love this movie! Captain Marvel's two big problems are that her hair is short and it is blonde. But that's OK. Not everyone is as fortunate as Lucy Hale or Megan Fox. Brie Larson is still very pretty and has a sparkling personality. Overall, this is definitely a movie worth watching.

"Culled from the real life exploits of Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie in 1890s New York, ""The Bowery"" is high energy and good natured.<br /><br />But be warned: Casual racial epithets flow off the tongues of Wallace Beery and little Jackie Cooper. The very first shot might be startling. This is true to the time it was set and the time it was made. And it also speaks to the diversity of population in that neck of the woods. It certainly adds to the gritty flavor of the atmosphere.<br /><br />Beery as Connors is the blustering thunder at the center of the action, a loud-mouth saloon keeper with his own fire brigade. And he has a soft spot for ornery orphan Cooper. Raft as Brodie is Connors' slicker, better looking rival in almost every endeavor. Brodie could never turn down a dare and loved attention, leading up to a jump off the Brooklyn Bridge (it is still debated whether he actually jumped or used a dummy).<br /><br />Beery is as bombastic as ever with a put-on Irish-American accent. He is just the gruff sort of character to draw children, cats and ladies in distress. This is possibly the most boisterous character Raft ever played, and he even gets to throw in a little dancing (as well as a show of leg). And again he mistakes the leading lady (lovely Fay Wray) for a prostitute. Cooper is as tough as either of them, though he gets a chance to turn on the tears.<br /><br />The highlight isn't the jump off the bridge but a no-holds-barred fistfight between Connors and Brodie that in closeup looks like a real brawl between the principals. It's sure someone bruised more than an ego.",positive

"The movie could have received a three and a half for entertainment value, but I could not find myself to do so because of some key elements.

It didn't come organic, it was kind of forced and it became evident  in the fight sequences.n   Another problem I have with the movie was the depiction of the Skrull. That particular alien race is supposed to be evil but they kind of made it into some type of refugee type idea.n  I really think one of the biggest letdowns was the way Nick Fury received the scratches in his eye. That was ridiculous. I believe that was a missed opportunity to show something really cool.n  If the movie was not connected to the Marvel Universe then it would probably get C+ for some cool visuals and some okay action",controversial
"Let me get this one statement out of the way... I did not see this movie for Brie Larson. I have nothing against the actress. I don't really know her work other than King Kong. I saw this movie to see how Captain Marvel will fit into the Avengers: Endgame movie. With that being said, the movie is entertaining. The awesome thing about Marvel is they cast indispensable actors perfectly in iconic roles... Evans as Captain America, Hemsworth as Thor for examples. Larson is passable as Cpt. Marvel but I wouldn't say indispensable. She's no Wonder Woman. The movie however is a nice addition to the Marvel Universe. (On a side note: The worst part about this movie is how Fury loses his eye.)",positive
"This movie is painfully average, it's not the worst movie in the MCU, but it's far from being a good one. Brie Larsons hit or miss acting in this film is very distracting. She shows she has a fun side and can pull off some fun sarcastic moments, however her intimate and heartfelt scenes just fall flat because of her blank expressions and very stiff acting.",negative

"I don't think I have ever given a zero to anything. This will be the first. The acting is poor as usual, it feels like it was written by a committee of low end writers trying to imitate Lucas and after about the first 45 minutes I was waiting for the fart jokes as the writing was on that level. I can just assume that every paid critic is well paid by Disney to give an 85 average score. Much like the slightly better episode 7, this was just written as a bad fanfic almost entirely mimicking ep5 as ep7 mimicked ep4. Not helping anything the main cast have no charisma and virtually no acting ability.",controversial
"Most Captain Marvel's problems such as some undercooked plot points, some underwritten characters and pacing issues stem from a short runtime which was simply not enough for this very rich and intriguing storyline. Yes, this is the most engaging and most interesting plot in the MCU so far and I loved its twist, its SF elements and the entire Kree-Skrull conflict was so intriguing to me. Some of the action and VFX are questionable, but I loved the protagonist who's simply ridiculously overpowered, but still a fun character with an interesting origin story, Nick Fury steals the show throughout with his hilarious lines of dialogue, Maria Rambeau is the heart of the film and the cat is so amusing. So it's not one of the best MCU films, but it's one of the better ones and it simply flew by for me how engaging and funny it is. The connections with the other films are also excellent.",positive

Coming into it I thought it would be good because I like Natalie Portman alot and Susan Sarandon is a great actor too, but it was way better than I could have imagined. You come out of the movie feeling great. The acting was excellent, which is something that can be hard to come by lately. Natalie Portman is destined for great things and me being a college student at NYU, think that it is great that she is going to school instead of just being an actor. Anyways, back on subject, the movie keeps you interested the entire way through and I definitely think that everyone should go see it. I would give more details, but I don't want to give away the movie.",positive
"The only reason this movie made big bucks was because of being the prelude to Endgame. Plot was loose and really boring. The writers made no effort to develop a really interesting story for Captain Marvel. nnThey tried to empower women but they failed, in my opinion. They showed us a ""badass"" heroine since the beginning till the end. No character development for Carol and showing us she being kind of cocky and a show-off due to her ultimate limitless power. Brie Larson performance didn't help at all. I think any other actress could've done the same or better. She acted the whole movie like she was reading a speech or from the teleprompter. nnAlso, the way they took down other characters in her favor (Nick Fury) was nosense. It was the 90's and Fury was acting like he just joined the forces with no spy experience whatsoever. They wasted the skrulls as villains in a ""plot twist"" extremely dumm and unnecessary, with jokes very flat and unfunny and incorrect timing for them.nnIn my opinion, you can tell the movie was very influentiated by the fact of having 2 directors, which is not always bad, but in this case it was. They didn't follow the Marvel way and they paid the price, not economically since it passed the billion, but in storytelling. I understand they make these movies for children as well and we won't be able to to see movies like Winter Soldier or Infinity War very often but damn, they didn't commit at all with this movie.",negative
"This was a highly-hyped movie prior to its release, but turned out to be a dud. I never talked to one person who ever liked this movie. I agree: I didn't like it, either.

"Just above the box i am typing in now, i was required to pick a number between 1 and 10, and rate this feature film. Unfortunately there is no option for a number less than zero, and i have to put something. If i had my choice i would just put nothing, no number, because there exist no digits that express the worthlessness of this movie.<br /><br />If you do decide to watch this film even after reading all of these horrible reviews, make sure there are no sharp or blunt objects in the area, this will help prevent you from trying to kill yourself in the middle of the film.<br /><br />I don't know how this film was released to the public, it should be locked up and guarded 24/7 somewhere in Fort Knox. I am angry that this film was even available for me to watch. I feel cheated by humanity, i had no idea humans could be this cruel. Stalin, Saddam and Hitler got nothing on this douche bag Cowell.<br /><br />Do not be fooled by the movie's cover. 1) There are no scarecrows, no one knows why there is a legit looking scarecrow on the front. 2)None of the characters on the back of case are even in the stinking movie! 3) The tag line says something about ""new moon, more victims"", there were no frigging victims no one even died. We don't know if the dam cop died, and i'm assuming the killer didn't die because it sounded like he was being hit over the head with a frigging whiffle ball bat.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie, it wasted about 4 hours of my life. That's right four, it took an hour for me to watch it (i fast forwarded thru the 4 minute zooming scenes that reveal nothing in the plot), i stared at the television for about an hour after it was over, contemplating my life and the direction it was heading after watching this crap, and then i began to cry for the next two hours because i know someone out there will unfortunately see this movie and there is nothing i can do to stop it.",negative
"I was curious to watch this movie. A lot of people seem to be excited. I also have my beliefs. I believe in Jesus Christ but I'm opened for any kind of views or opinions. It doesn't matter for me, if Jesus existed in the way it's written in the bible. If Maria was a virgin or not, or all the other similar pagan coincidences. What matters for me is the idea of salvation, the idea of love as the only way to find peace in this world.<br /><br />What made me angry is when somebody takes a sentence, present it as a fact but without showing the context it was written. For example, they showed in this movie following sentence big: ""Those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them - bring them here and kill them in front of me"" Jesus (Lukas 19:27) What they didn't tell you is the context. Jesus told a story about an evil king. There is no passage in the bible where Jesus supports killing. He is love! After quoting the bible wrong they present us yelling people (pseudo-christians) filled with hate. The majority of viewers don't check the informations presented so they start thinking Jesus=hate=not good for me or for anybody else. This is pure manipulation people. Please use your brain. Don't take everything as a fact they tell you in this movie. We destroy our own basis, our civilization if we start dismantling Jesus in this way and the message he brought to us.

"Wow, where to begin with this one. Well, if you enjoy laughing at the utter failures of filmmakers, then this one is for you. I bought this movie for 5 bucks because I never pass up an opportunity to laugh at B-movie God Casper Van Dien's blunders, and boy was this one of them. It may have been enough that this movie contains the single most lame movie monster ever. This thing, which is supposed to be an Indian ghost, looks more like a plastic candy bowl skeleton that you put on your front porch on Halloween. He dons a cape that is clearly a garbage bag, complete with what appears to be a bucket-shaped bonnet over his head. At some points this is a man in costume, at others it is clearly a plastic prop placed on top of a horse. This monster has the uncanny ability to see with ""predator"" vision, a clear rip-off, and can miraculously appear after throwing his spear. Sometimes the spear cuts people, sometimes it doesn't. This thing also manages to down a helicopter with a single arrow. Wow, this makes a much sense as when the kid blows up a spaceship with a firecracker at the end of ""Critters."" This creature is impervious to bullets, but somehow dies at the end of the movie. At the end of his killing spree, which we never really find out why he is on, he gets blown up. This is an incredible feat, for we had already seen this thing blow up 3 times in the film. But, I guess this last time was the charm. <br /><br />And don't even get me started on the lameness of the other characters. First of all, what Delta Force unit employs women? Last I checked the military still disallows women into combat situations. Also, this unit is ""undercover."" Why? What possible reason would they have to be undercover? And they're not even good at it, I guess no one would realize that they were military if they didn't have on uniforms, BUT THEY WERE ALL CARRYING MACHINE GUNS (which incidentally change sound effects throughout the film, at some points sounding like air rifle BB guns, and at others, canons). There is one part when the Skeleton Man throws some construction workers from a catwalk, and you can clearly see the pad that they fall onto. At another point. Michael Rooker falls down a hill that is clearly flat ground. They tilted the camera slightly to give the appearance of an incline, but he is clearly pushing himself along in this looooooonnnnnggggggg fall scene. Then when he is helped back up the hill, the rope is flat, and when it shows the woman at the ""top"" of the ""hill"" the rope goes upward from her grip, not the way it would look if she was pulling someone up a hill. Rooker actually has a line that says, ""I'm not going after him, I going after it."" What? That is quite possibly the dumbest thing I have ever heard, and I watch these bad movies as a hobby. The saddest part about this quote is that you can tell that everyone involved in the writing/production of this film thought that it was so bad-ass. Believe it or not, compared to the rest of the dialog, this is good. <br /><br />The acting, bad. The makeup, really bad. These characters either had scars or wounds that liked to change sides of their face. Maybe these are alien scars that like to run around on your face. Yeah, I think I'll make a movie about that, ""Attack of the Alien Scars that Move Around on Your Face."" That villain would be more intimidating than the Skeleton Man, and the film would probably be scarier.",negative
"Standing by itself, Captain Marvel almost has the feel of a coming of age story, one that instead of a teenager fighting against her parents and trying to figure out boys, has her struggling to remember her jumbled past and find out the truth about her Kree ""upbringing"". nnMore road trip adventure than epic quest, it has a well placed balance of action, humor and 90's easter eggs to satisfy those familiar with Carols origins as well as comic diehards. Some moments and lines here and there feel a little flat, or in some cases, maybe a bit forced, but they are very few. In most respects, the story is nothing completely unexplored before, but Marvel isn't trying to break new ground, they know a solid story when they have it, and the cast does the most of the heavy lifting.nnSeveral moments of note for the pathetic trolls who have taken it upon themselves to hate a movie they haven't seen were not lost on the audience. #1 a forgettably typical biker rudely demands that Carol ""smile"" for him, something that crossed over into Brie Larsons life and yielded a hilarious and well deserved response. And #2 , after the scenes crossing with her as a little girl standing up, and all the versions of her life standing against those who told her to give up or to stay down... After the final battle against those who still are trying to control her, the response she gives as she looks down at her enemy (and possibly at the audience that is out to hate her for being female, speaking her mind, etc) is ..."" I don't need your permission.""  nnIn the same line as Antman, Thor and Spiderman Homecoming, Captain Marvel is more family oriented fare than some of the heavier Marvel titles, but still thuroughly enjoyable.nnA strong, colorful entry into the marvel collection and an origin story with heart and passion. Also, The 2 end credits scenes help set up next months Endgame with a lot of anticipation. 4 out of 5 starsnnnn",controversial

"Set in the 1970s Los Angeles, Christopher Boyce has just dropped out of seminary school and returned back home were his father gets him a job where he monitors intelligence documents. His old friend Daulton Lee is a ratty cock drug-dealer, and gets caught in a set-up and must choose between becoming a narc or facing a long stint in prison. When up on bail, he jumps and heads to Mexico City. Chris offers Lee in a partnership to be his messenger to sell secret papers to the Soviet Union embassy in Mexico City, because of the disgrace he feels about the US Government's control over weaker countries to their own gain. But over time the two begin to clash with their motivations and find themselves in something bigger then they had originally intended.<br /><br />Director John Schlesinger has spun out such films like the respectable ""Midnight Cowboy"", ""Marathon Man"", ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" and ""Day of The Locust"". While ""The Falcon and the Snowman"" might not be held up that high, there's no question that this sombre espionage drama (inspired by a true incident) is an unjustly overlooked character portrait. Everything about it, is quite a subdued affair with no real grandeur qualities hitting a massive mark. The driving factor of the film has got to be the admirably versatile lead performances of Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn as the two ambitious young lads Chris and Daulton. Penn is especially good with his uneasy intensity, which works well off Hutton's superbly cool-and-collected turn. What starts off as easy, we watch the situation gradually crumble, as the two amateurs find themselves really out of their league. The strongly detailed and symbolic (predatory behaviour) plot mainly centres on the pair's relationship and that of their reasoning's for their actions, which eventually shows us the knotty developments that led to their downfall. The plan opens up like a wound to never properly heal, due to Daulton's drug addiction, which really makes him go off the rails and leaves Chris to pick up all the slack. The searing political aspect is there, but it focus on the themes of idealism (Boyce) and greed (Lee) to get its point across. Both don't mix and results show. Suspense is justified through its stimulating pot-boiling script and character interactions then that of any visual gimmicks. Action is very little, but still there's a pressure induced style to Schlesinger's assured and realistically dark 'n' gritty direction. Pacing is mostly well handled, although some sequences do seem to wallow on for too long, but however it grips you as it plays on its authentically paranoid tone to slowly build up to an exploding tight latter end. Adeptly fleshed into the technical production is an airily harrowing music score and professionally poignant cinematography. The supporting cast are exceptionally fine with Pat Hingle, Lori Singer, David Suchet, Boris Leskin, Jerry Hardin and Joyce Van Patten. Also look out for Michael Ironside in a tiny part as a FBI agent.<br /><br />A mostly outstanding spy-film that benefits largely from talented lead performances and by not playing the usual stakes. It's more an emotional ride, then a complex one of twists. Recommended.",positive
"This may be the worst film adaptation of a Broadway musical ever. Even the music has been destroyed. Attenborough knows nothing about theater - almost every shot and moment ring false.

I can not for the life of me understand what is meant (conceptually) by opening the film with an exterior of the theater where ""A Chorus Line"" is playing. Are we to think that these people are auditioning for ""A Chorus Line,"" which contains the stories about the people who are auditioning?

"The movie suffered from weak writing and Brie Larson's poor acting. I don't know how she was ever cast for this role unless her competition for the part was Danny Devito in a wig. I found her wooden and lacking any character dynamics. She was a cookie cutter comic hero with no real depth. Her backstory was muddled and incoherent. Here character arc was rudderless - I sometimes found myself forgetting where she was going, or what the mission was. There were plenty of entertaining action scenes, but not enough to carry the movie. One thing that did come out of this movie is a very obvious need to make a buddy cop film staring young Coulson and Nick Fury. You're welcome, Marvel. Make this film!",negative

"Tierney's an authentic tough guy, but this movie misfire from normally competent RKO undercuts his impact at every turn. The script is about as plausible as OJ Simpson at a Ten Cmmandments dinner. Just count the times Tierney's incredible car companions swallow one lame excuse after another for his evasive and violent acts. The old cliché about it ""only happening in the movies"" applies here in spades. Then there's the guy playing the watchman, who appears to have wandered in from a boozy WC Fields comedy, ruining the menacing mood in the process. The static one-room sets don't help either, and neither does director Feist's obvious lack of feel for the material. Then add a final car chase missing both imagination and pay-off, and the results are pretty flat. In fact the movie only picks up in the station-house scenes where hard-bitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocent-looking gas station attendants. Too bad that Tieney's career never really gelled. I gather that was due largely to being as big a tough guy off-screen as on and getting in one sleazy scrape after another. His ice-cold manner and clarity of emotion remind me at times of Lee Marvin at his tough-guy best. Anyway this project might have worked as a radio play, but as a movie with a promising noir title, it's a disappointment.",negative

"This isn't a 1 star movie or a 5 star movie. Ithose suggesting either are too deeply invested in he politics of this movie. The movie is objectively a dull, borderline average film. The movie starts of great and then declines into boredom and eventually leads to indifference. The plot is so generic it's shocking it had so many writers workin on it and Brie Larson was a terrible choice for th e film. Her performance is terrible mainly because she delivers all her lines like she has utter contempt for everyone around her. Jackson and Mendelsohn are the saving graces of this movie - they at least give engaging and likeable performances. When you're main character is unlikeable, unrelatable and goes from over powered to more over powered you haven't got a good film.

"Overall, not a bad movie. I enjoyed much of the movie but most of that enjoyment did not come from Larson's portrayal of Carol Danvers. She seemed so bland throughout the movie and the moments that needed to be emotionally intense fell flat for me, mostly due to Brie Larson or however she was being directed. I don't know which it was but she was very nonchalant in every situation in this movie and all of her facial expressions were the same. Samuel L. Jackson as Fury was a little odd especially in scenes with Larson. Not sure what it was but he seemed to be  in love with her. Goose was the funniest part of the movie, hands down. Every joke by Larson fell flat for me, it just felt very forced and delivery was off. I'm not trying to hate on her but I just couldn't get past her performance in this. And also, she's way overpowered as Captain Marvel. If she comes in to save the day for the Avengers and steals their thunder like she did Fury's, I may be done with the MCU for a while.

Nick Fury's origin story starts here and the super spy who compartmentalises his information, whilst playing intifciates games of chess with our main characters through inspiration all speeches and misdirection, not to mention fabricated stories (e.g Coulsons playing cards in the Avengers) gets a comedic but crucial scene that many will hate but that essentially fits the character and builds on his persona of being a partial smoke screen and master manipulator because the reality is some times the origin story and reality is just not as cool as Nick Fury would want it to sound.",negative

"I honestly do not understand why everyone is so adamantly against this movie. As a story goes it is just as fine as all the other MCU stories. The feminist part of it is just fine by me. What do people expect? In the nineties the first women pilots were deployed into war zones. Some of them got medals for their valor. Now this is all fantasy but at least they give us a woman who was strong and wanted to prove herself in a world dominated by men. Now, as an MCU movie it has given us a glimpse into the future of the franchise and it looks bright. It has also shown us perhaps the next villain of the MCU after Thanos: The Supreme Intelligence. The plot twist was fine and I'm sure this is gonna come back in the following stories. The MCU has come a long way and has farther to go. ",controversial
"Movie lacked depth. Focused more on being a feminist movie with a ""yeah, women can do it!"" except there was nothing Danvers was prevented from being able to do. She didn't have any self doubt that she couldn't do it. She didn't have anyone telling her she couldn't do it, aside from flashbacks. All of the ""Women can do it!"" Message came from flashbacks and wasn't related to the actual story at all, it felt like they were supposed to somehow relate but they just didn't. Aside from that, it's a fish out of water amnesia story you can see done better in numerous movies. Brie Larson was too stoic for the fun-loving, life embracing Carol Danvers. Leaned too heavily on 90s nostalgia and other mcu related tie ins rather than craft its own story. Better than the Iron Man sequels and thor two but that's about it. Focused more on the ""Ladies you can do it!"" message than comedy or action. Great supporting cast, but Brie Larson just didn't pull her weight. Often her biggest interactions besides punching stuff was interacting with the child character. Based on her portrayal, it seems like she didn't want to do any hard work for any part of the movie that wasn't something that could inspire young females. Wonder Woman is definitely better at executing a superhero movie with a female lead, rather than this take on making a movie with a female superhero.",controversial

"Captain Marvel is mid-tier MCU; not remotely great, but not remotely bad. Larson gives a strong and charismatic lead performance as the titular hero, and Sam Jackson's young Nick Fury makes for an entertaining secondary character working beside Marvel (and displays some mind-blowing CGI). There's nothing entirely different or unique about Captain Marvel, not much that sets it apart from other MCU origin stories. It's a fine, fun but ultimately forgettable effort.",negative

It wasn't slap you in the face Ă˘girl powerĂ˘? but rather carefully constructed characters that show strength and determination, and those characters just happened to be female. Larson was amazing, both soft and strong, spunky but in control. Also loved that her memories were incorporated into the plot instead of just flashbacks. The soundtrack was amazing (Nirvana, No Doubt, Hole!?), and comedy was sprinkled throughout. The fact that the fight scene was a wash showed why she just might be able to beat Thanos.",controversial
"This is a surprisingly great low budget Horror/Comedy, it's funny and pretty well made, with good performances and a really cool twist ending!. All the characters are pretty cool, and the story while unoriginal is very good, plus Eric Jungmann(Adam) and Justin Urich(Harley) had fantastic chemistry together. One of the funniest moments in the film for me is when Adam is trapped in the bathroom, and Harley wakes up to find that monster truck sitting there, and decides to take a p*ss in the truck, and Aimee Brooks is just plain sexy!, plus this is one of the best low budget Horror films I have seen in a long time. It's very gory, but in a comical way, and I thought it was very well written as well, plus Michael Bailey Smith is fantastic as the Monster Man and had some wicked makeup!. It's similar to films like Joy Ride, Duel, Jeepers Creepers, etc, etc and it has some suspenseful moments here and there, plus The gore effects are really well done for the most part. This is a surprisingly great low budget Horror/Comedy, it's funny and pretty well made, with good performances and a really cool twist ending, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is very good!. Michael Davis does a very good! job here, with great camera work, good angles,good use of colors, and using a great setting, plus he kept the film funny and at a very fast pace.<br /><br />There is a lot of gore!. We get extremely bloody nose bleeds,gory impaling's, bloody stabbings,guy is cut in half by a monster truck, human remains in a cooked stew, guts all over the place,guys guts fall out,pencil in the eyes,bloody slit throat,bunch of people walking around without limbs,gory dead squirrel,heads are squished,severed limbs,bloody and mangled corpses,decent amount of bloodshed,one very gory scene at the very end and more!.<br /><br />The Acting is very good for a low budget film. Eric Jungmann is fantastic here as Adam, he was a nerd but a very likable one, he had fantastic chemistry with Justin Urich, had some cool lines,and I just loved his character, he also seemed to be enjoying himself,and he was especially good at the end!. Justin Urich is excellent as the ass of a Best Friend, however I just couldn't help but love him as he was very funny, and often stole a lot of the scenes, I really dug him!. Aimee Brooks is gorgeous, and did great with what she had to do, she had good chemistry with Jungmann and like Jungmann was especially good at the end, as I loved her mysterious character. Michael Bailey Smith is wonderful as The Monster Man he was very creepy looking, had some awesome makeup, and is now one of my favorite slashers!. Rest of the cast do fine.<br /><br />Overall I highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5",positive

"This solid black and white slapstick comedy with a dark (but hopelessly contrived) plot is a true crowd pleaser that will have you howling with laughter (as well as rolling your eyes with disbelief).<br /><br />It's the old psychopath on a train story but that is of no big importance as the thriller portion of the film almost seems to be merely a counterweight to the antics of the great comedian Robert Gustafsson. His hapless, nearly incurably optimistic soldier invokes both compassion and schadenfreude in a fashion that almost rivals Chevy Chase.<br /><br />The thing about the film that appealed to me the most, however, is that wedged between the improbable and the hilarious are the accurately portrayed everyday joys and nuisances of train travel. They add a most welcome sense of realism and recognition.<br /><br />This thriller comedy has admittedly borrowed most of its ""suspense"" from Hitchcock and should, in my opinion, only be watched for its comedy value (which is high indeed). Besides Gustafsson, Lars Amble's solid performance as a delightfully cynical misogynist is worth the price of admission alone.<br /><br />Heartily recommend.",positive

Im not sure what all the hype is about, perhaps all the deleted reviews werent trolls.  Overall Id rate this as a low average Marvel film.

"Captain Meh-vel. Being a fan of the comics, I was really looking forward to this film. The movie changes Danvers' origin story, how Nick Fury loses his eye and how the Avengers received its name. I didn't mind that as much as I was annoyed by the amount of 90s references and stoic, soft spoken and underwhelming performance by Brie Larson. At the beginning of the film we understand why in the previews Brie seems like she's keeping her emotions in check. There is a turning point in the film where all that seemingly changes and Carol is free to show emotion again. The problem is she doesn't. The climax of the film sees her mute and expressionless as she destroys a small fleet of ships. This moment sucked me out of the film. Ultimately, due to a poor script, unfocused narrative, poor direction and TOO MANY 90s references, I found myself bored and waiting for the movie to end. Stay for the midcredits scene. It was better than the entire film. I want to see what the Russo's can bring out of Brie in Endgame.

Unfortunately, that's not what I got. Brie Larson's acting was also very bland. The other characters were probably the best part of the movie. Goose the cat, had more emotion than she showed throughout that whole movie. Her relationship with Jackson was a highlight, reminiscent of The Doctor and Donna. Talos/Telos was fun to watch.

"This is the type of film that may need to be viewed several times to capture all of its beauty and intelligence { just like Curse of Frankenstein from 1957} . If you don't like odd, non-mainstream films, steer clear of this masterpiece. For me, the artwork alone in this film is worth the purchase price of the videocassete. The storyline is a bit fantastic but seems to becoming reality in our world today. For being produced in the 1980s, this film is proving to be a prophetic vision of whats to come with Big government and Big brother wanting to control and monitor us.<br /><br />There are many slow sections and the dialog can be quite hard to catch in many scenes { thats why I've watched it 6 times now} but if you can digest it all, it may prove to be well worth your time.<br /><br />The film is basically about a world where people have evolved into robotic machines that have lost their individualism . They are only concerned about accumulating and procreating. The hero of the film has not succumb to this sickness and has not been "" tagged"" and monitored by big brother. His mission is to release a secret drug into the water supply which will change the way the human robots think and allow individulaism to once again be a part of humanity.<br /><br />Yes, its very low budget, but for its time the computer effects and sound effects are very unique and the paintings are utterly fascinating. If you have an open mind, this film should impress and its prophetic visions are chilling.",positive
"On the face of it a film about women wanting to see a football match wouldn't appeal much to somebody with little interest in football such as myself however this isn't about football it is about discrimination and the women's enthusiasm for the sport they love.<br /><br />The film opens on the day of a crucial World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain, a girl is trying to get in to Tehran's Azadi Stadium by dressing like a boy, it looks like she will get in until a soldier tries to search her. Once caught she is taken to a small enclosure high up on the outside of the stadium where there are a handful of women who had already been caught, here they are guarded by a small group of conscript soldiers who's leader would rather be back home tending his livestock. We never learn the character's names but we get to know them as people as the girls plead with the guards to let them watch though a nearby gap in the wall and when refused try to get them to at least provide a commentary.<br /><br />As well as making an important point about the rigid gender segregation in much of present day Iran the film contains many hilarious moments such as the ""disguise"" one of the girls is made to wear when going to the toilet and the girl who disguised herself as a soldier and was only caught because she chose to watch the match from a seat reserved for a senior officer. The girls enthusiasm for the game is such that by the end the viewer is likely to be on the edge of their seat hoping that Iran will win and thus get to go to the finals in Germany. The soldiers aren't shown as fundamentalists, they are just conscripts who are there because they have to be and when explaining to the girls why woman can't watch men's sports don't seem that convinced by their own arguments.<br /><br />It is a shame that this film can't be seen in Iran itself but it is good that the wider world can see it and thus see that ordinary Iranians aren't a bunch of fanatics desperate to wage war on the west but normal people with the same passions and concerns as people everywhere. The cast did a great job in making their characters seem like real people rather than mere caricatures.",positive
"I was all in for a feminist movie if this one could be it, but is not the case. Taking the so-so script aside, the movie is like a copy-paste of scenes I would do on iMovie, many of them roughly transitioning to the next, each once on a while a 90s song to remind you that's the theme even when they're a bit forced to. And like, they don't even have the spice girls if they were trying to go so hard for the feminist retoric.. But in any case, Brie Larson is plain boring, she's emotionless and let's say that's the character. Still, not even the action moves were that well done. When she looks into the camera is like she drains your life through the screen. That's how boring and uninspiring she is",controversial

"This movie was definitely what we have come to expect from marvel. Filled with action with relatively good CGI. There were several aspects of the movie, however, that I was not super pleased with and why I gave a medium/neutral rating. 1) I hated the way Fury lost his eye. 2) I disliked how carol danvers received her powers. I felt this process has been done before and was looking for something a little more unique. The Kree blood transfusion made it look like she might be inhuman and go down the path of agents of shield, but nope not it. 3) I was disappointed by the Skrulls. In the comics they were much more BA than this and seemed like a pretty weak race in this movie.nnI was definitely looking for more originality in the origin story and there was almost zero. Just another popcorn flick to bring your kids too. I feel this movie needed to be more aligned with the MCU lore. At level 3 in shield, Fury wouldn't have had the power to do anything, nevertheless institute an Ă˘avengers initiativeĂ˘?. The supreme intelligence was kind of just thrown into the movie with little background information. Unless you read the comics, you wouldn't know that the Kree race was run by a super computer AI. nnAlthough I would have liked this character to be introduced later (stage 4) I get that without the introduction of Adam Wallock, marvel needed an equivalent powered character to fill the void. Just disappointing to me as I feel this character development could have been so much more.nnDefinitely a strong movie, but more aligned with Doctor strange or iron man 2 in respect to where I would rate this movie.",negative

"This movie starts off somewhat slowly and gets running towards the end. Not that that is bad, it was done to illustrate character trait degression of the main character. Consequently, if you are not into tragedies, this is not your movie. It is the thought provoking philosophy of this movie that makes it worthwhile. If you liked Dostoyevsky's 'Crime and Punishment,"" you will probably like this if only for the comparisons. The intriguing question that the movie prompts is, ""What is it that makes a renowned writer completely disregard his publicly-aproved ideas for another set?"" The new ideas are quite opposed to the status quo-if you are a conservative you will not like this movie. <br /><br />Besides other philosophical questions, I must admit that the movie was quite aesthetically pleasing as well. The grassy hillsides and beautiful scenery helped me get past the slow start. Also, there was use of coloric symbolism in representing the mindstate of the main characters. If these sorts of things do not impress you, skip it. Overall I give this movie a 7.",positive

"Thunderbirds (2004) <br /><br />Director: Jonathan Frakes <br /><br />Starring: Bill Paxton, Ben Kingsley, Brady Corbet <br /><br />54321! Thunderbirds are GO! <br /><br />And so began Thunderbirds, a childhood favorite of mine. When I heard that they were going to make a Thunderbirds movie, I was ecstatic. I couldn't wait to see Thunderbird 2 roar in to save people, while Thunderbird 4 would dive deep into theyou get the idea. I just couldn't wait. Then came August 2004, when the movie was finally released. Critics panned it, but I still wanted to go. After all, as long as the heart was in the same place, that was all that mattered to me. So I sat down in the theater, the only teenager in a crowd of 50everyone else was over thirty and under ten. Quite possibly the most awkward theater experience that I have ever had <br /><br />The movie (which is intended to be a prequel) focuses on Alan Tracy (Brady Corbet), the youngest of the Tracy family. He spends his days wishing that he could be rescuing people like the rest of his family, but he's too young. One day, he finally gets his chance when The Hood (Ben Kingsley) traps the rest of his family up on Thunderbird 5 (the space station). This involves him having to outsmart The Hood's henchmen and rescue his family in time before The Hood can steal all of the money from the Bank of England.<br /><br />Trust me, the plot sounds like a regular episode of Thunderbirds when you read it on paper. Once it gets put on to filmwhat a mess we have on our hands. First off, the film was intended for children, much like the original show was. However, Gerry Anderson treated us like adults, and gave us plots that were fairly advanced for children's programming. This on the other hand, dumbs down the plot as it tries to make itself a ripoff of the Spy Kids franchise. The final product is a movie that tries to appeal to fans of the Thunderbirds series and children, while missing both entirely. Lame jokes, cartoonish sounds, and stupid antics that no one really finds amusing are all over this movie, and I'm sure that Jonathan Frakes is wishing he'd never directed this.<br /><br />Over all, everyone gave a solid performance, considering the script that they were all given. Ben Kingsley was exceptional as The Hood, playing the part extremely well. My only complaint about the characters is about The Hood's henchmen, who are reduced to leftovers from old Looney Tunes cartoons, bumbling about as, amazingly enough, the kids take them on with ease.<br /><br />What's odd about this movie is that while I was watching the movie, I had fun. But once the lights went up, I realized that the movie was fairly bad, I was $8 lighter, and two hours of my time were now gone. A guilty pleasure? Perhaps. Nonetheless, Thunderbirds is a forgettable mess. Instead of a big ""go"", I'm going to have to recommend that you stay away from this movie. If the rest of movie could have been like the first ten minutes of it, it would have been an incredible film worthy of the Thunderbirds name. However, we get a movie that only die-hard Thunderbirds fans (if you'd like to watch your childhood torn to pieces) or the extremely bored should bother with.<br /><br />My rating for Thunderbirds is 1 ½ stars.",negative
"Best Star Wars film made as of yet. Everything about this movie was incredible, aside from minor issues. Every performance, the multiple extremely engaging plot points and insanely awesome character arcs and bonds, the ridiculously amazing fight scenes and chase scenes with the most stunning CGI, the humour and general Star Wars banter between characters and the creatures within the galaxy, the as-ever intense battle between the First Order and the rebels... usually I go in depth when reviweing a film, but the 5000 character limit holds me back. The only thing which I think they could've handled better was the way they scripted Finn, as I was kind of disappointed at the way his storyline ended. 100% go and see this film, regardless of whether you know what Star Wars is or not.

"all the criticism over excess feminism was a bit overblown.  The main problem with the movie was that Brie Larson, is not really suited for a superhero roll.  She lacks the fundamental charisma that is needed in a superhero lead.  Her timing seemed off on her one liners and just didn't have that presence of a great superhero.  With characters in the MCU like Scarlet Witch, you can feel her pain in her acting and motives, with Captain Marvel, it's just kind of bland and without passion.",negative

"I supposed I was actually expecting a Bollywood remake of ""The Fog"", from the title, but this is actually more of a Bollywood remake of ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", with some elements of ""Scream"", kind of, sort of, and not a very good one either. Apart from a couple very entertaining song & dance numbers, this is pretty terrible. It's obviously got a decent budget & yet it's wasted on reheated leftovers that weren't that tasty to begin with. A young woman is threatened by a creepy guy to not enter a beauty contest, because he wants his sister to win (she, thankfully, doesn't look as creepy as her brother), but she enters anyway and wins, and of course the creepy guy comes after her, and is killed, after which comes a rousing game of ""hide the body"". Of course, the body disappears and no one seems to know why, but someone knows, and they're waiting for the end to reveal a ridiculous plot twist. Interspersed with all this tired rehash are a few nifty dance numbers, especially the celebratory dance number at the party for Simran, the girl who won the beauty contest...it's highly colorful, it's well done & downright fun, and utterly wasted in this terrible film. I would much rather watch an old Ramsay brothers movie than this piece of crap, although someone has deemed that these don't need to be made available, for the most part, which is a crime in itself. But not as big of a crime as this film. I took one for the team watching this one, so take my advice, don't bother. 2 out of 10.",negative
"This review may contain some SPOILERS.<br /><br />Just when you thought they didn't make them so extremely bad anymore, along comes Rae Dawn Chong as a space vixen and Willie Nelson as a Native American witchdoctor! It's even worse when you factor in that these two are the BETTER aspects of `Starlight,' a film that should only be viewed for laughs.<br /><br />Chong is an alien sent to Earth to seek out the only remaining half-breed, part man and part alien. Apparently, the Earth is in dire straits. Something is wrong with the genetics of mankind, and in a few decades the world will be turned into a polluted wasteland. Only by duplicating the DNA of the half-breed can the kindly alien race save the planet. Don't ask me how that is, since the movie gives the impression that the world will be destroyed by pollution, which is caused by humans. You would think Earth could only be saved by getting rid of the polluting creatures, not saving them! Anyway, the half-breed turns out to be Billy Wirth, a man living in a small Southwestern town and is part Native American from his mother's line, despite the fact that his mother is a red-headed Caucasian and his grandfather is Willie Nelson. Wasn't this the sort of malarkey that made the bombastic Carmen Electra bomb `The Chosen One' such a howler? Chong arrives in her ship just as Wirth nearly drowns after driving his motorcycle into a lake in a fit of recklessness being the result of just breaking up with his girlfriend. Before you can say utter the word `hogwash,' Chong is revealing her secret to Wirth, who isn't surprised for a moment, and spreading the word to Wirth's family. Chong also makes pals with Wirth's mother, who seems to have lost a few of her marbles over the years. Well, this is because Wirth's father was an alien that abandoned her. Of course, he is the standard rogue alien that has conveniently picked this moment to come to Earth for Wirth so he can use Wirth's DNA to make the people of Earth his slaves. (Huh?) His laughable attempts to use his telepathic powers and capture Wirth suck up most of the screen time and are the worst scenes in the movie. Not only are they boring, but they are the scenes where you will be spotting the flubs the most.<br /><br />The ideas might be nice on paper, but they are handled here with the utmost of stupidity, particularly in the aforementioned scenes with the rogue alien. But the effects are the bane of the movie. The opening scene involves Chong on her spaceship, communicating with her superior, someone who we do not see but that Chong communicates with through a vat that emits pink light. They use no spoken words, but telepathy, so we are treated to subtitles. Trouble is, both Chong and her superior's subtitles both look alike, and the director gives you no indication as to which of the two are actually `speaking' at any given moment, which makes the whole conversation nothing but gibberish. The spaceship is the worst effect to come out of Hollywood this side of an Ed Wood film. Now, I am usually lenient on effects when dealing with a low budgeted film such as this, but these effects really got to me. The most offensive was the most simple one: a fake night sky. The stars in the sky are so phony they almost sound off a dial tone. Most notably are the moments where Chong tells someone she comes from Pleiades, and we get a shot of the seven stars. Thing is, the seven stars take up about half the night sky in the movie, but any stargazer knows that Pleiades is a star cluster between the constellations Perseus and Taurus, and the cluster doesn't take up much room in the sky at all. These effects just get so lousy that your jaw will hang lower and lower with every passing moment. Be careful, for it will go right through the floor during the finale when the effects have Willie Nelson turn into a human spotlight and . . . Oh, it has to be seen to be believed!<br /><br />Starlight, star bright; Last star I see tonight; I wish I might, I wish I may; not have to watch any more of this trash today.<br /><br />Zantara's score: 1 out of 10.",negative

"This is an epic film about the unification of the ancient kingdoms of China in the third century BC. What makes it interesting is the tragic downfall of the king and all the palace intrigue going on around him. It reminded me a bit of ""King Lear"" and some of the other Shakespeare plays.<br /><br />The king starts out with noble ambitions, to unify the kingdoms under one ruler and to stop all the quarrelling so that the people can prosper and lead better lives. He and his childhood sweetheart, played beautifully by Li Gong, concoct a scheme whereby she pretends to go into exile in a rival kingdom in order to recruit an assassin to kill the king, thus giving him a pretext to go to war. But while she's away, the king becomes sadistic in his lust for power and goes on a killing spree.<br /><br />There are numerous side plots that keep the action going. There is the Marquis, who pretends to be stupid and foppish but who's really very clever and wants to become king himself. He fathers two children with the king's mother and manages to keep it secret for years. Then there is the Prime Minister, a political rival to the king, who turns out to really be his father. <br /><br />The assassin is a complex character himself. An adept swordsman and killer, he is undergoing a reformation when the king's lover comes to recruit him. He wants nothing more with killing, but is eventually won over by Li Gong (who wouldn't be?) when he sees how cruel and vicious the king has become.<br /><br />Some spectacular cinematography, especially the battle scenes that are carried out on a grand scale - like they used to say, a cast of thousands, literally. The acting is OK, nothing special. It's the story that's interesting, though at over two and a half hours, it pushes the limit.<br /><br />Definitely worth viewing.",positive
"The 1930' were a golden age of Los Angeles with its film industry and great potential of various other possibilities to become rich and famous and happy. People were arriving there hoping to fulfill their dreams. Expecting open arms and welcoming offers there were only a few who managed to succeed and find their way to stardom, majority then condemned to live starving, disillusioned and unwanted, searching for a bit of respect in dirty bars and nasty hotel rooms. <br /><br />Young Italian-American writer Arturo Bandini arrives to LA on a similar quest - to spread his charms around to get one of those beautiful wealthy women and to write an excellent novel that would set him on a career path, having so far written a single short story published in an obscure anthology. Wishing to create a romantic masterpiece he seems to be unable to produce anything without experiencing it himself though, occasionally, he sends pieces of magazine stories to a local editor that helps him survive. He is proud to present himself as an Italian but deep in his heart he truly feels his Italian origin as a burden. The little money and the courage to conquer the world he once had are all long gone and watching his dream turning into a hangover he holds a last single nickel to spend. <br /><br />The coffee she brought him was cold and sour and spitting a curse on her triggers a never-ending relationship of insults, unspoken excuses and a love concealed beneath. Camilla being an uneducated girl trying to receive US citizenship through a marriage also carries her heavy cross of a non-perspective racial heritage. Though she is much of a stronger and life experienced person her situation as a beautiful Mexican woman is much harder to deal with than Arturo is able to realize. <br /><br />Is it obvious that Arturo eventually finds his inspiration to work on the novel? Is it possible that their love finally finds its place in the sun? Is it likely that their romance takes an unlucky turn?<br /><br />It is very surprising to find out that the chemistry between the two main characters, performed by Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, does not work. The relationship lacks the raw and authentic feelings. Hayek though livelier a character compared to Farrell's forgot to arm Camilla with the passion and strength of her once brilliant character Frida. Also it is hard to have faith in a character which being intelligent but uneducated and illiterate uses quite difficult vocabulary and complicated sentences. A tougher character of a Phil Marlowe sort would definitely suit Farrell better, though he looks stunning in a period costume, he seems very lost trying to find the fragile world of a twenty-year old dreamer balancing between a hidden love and desire to be true to himself. <br /><br />Feeling embarrassed watching the two on the screen is not right. Their relationship might have been wild but it is more likely what a thunder and a lightning are without a storm, far from real passion, feelings just described not felt inside. It is very sad that such a potential of an interesting script and good actors was wasted, turned into a grey average of soon-to-be-forgotten.",negative
"I don't care about all the controversy of this movie and Bree Larson to start off with. Out of all of the Marvel movies since 2008, I believe this film was the least enjoyable out of all of them. I had high expectations I guess. CGI for Samuel L Jackson was great though! Did not even notice it! There were a couple laughs in the movie. Great chemistry between Samuel and Bree on screen. Also, a surprising and satisfying twist. Overall, I couldn't watch this in theaters again, nor do I feel the need to ever watch this movie again. Once was enough, the cinematography felt bland and flavorless. It felt like millions of dollars was given to a group of highschool students for a film project. The execution of the character and idea was underwhelming, and over all just an unsatisfying film. ",negative
"This is a wonderful new crime series, bringing together three old stalwarts of British television (Denis Waterman, James Bolam and Alun Armstrong) as retired detectives brought back to help clear up old cases, under the leadership of younger, career-focused Amanda Redman. The three quirky, irritable old cops make a brilliant team, applying twenty-year old detection methods in a police force which has moved a long way on since then - sometimes with effect, at other times to the horror of their senior officers. The three are portrayed sympathetically, warts and all. There are splendid comic scenes, and some very moving ones as each of the three has to come to terms with growing old and the legacy of their pasts.<br /><br />At the end of the first six-part series (we are promised a further series next year) each of the characters had developed. Widower James Bolam cannot come to terms with his wife's untimely death. Lothario Denis Waterman is learning to accept his role as grandfather. And even obsessive Alun Armstrong is helped by his new friends to fight the demons of his past - and keep taking the medication! While Amanda Redman has to face the all-too-familiar conflict between having a life and a career. The story lines have been interesting, if rather heavily dependent on the wonders of DNA-testing. But it is the interplay of four of Britain's finest actors which has made the series unmissable.",positive

"This movie is a must for all people that enjoy soccer as an art. What strikes first about this movie about a soccer world cup is the way it is filmed. Besides following the play like a TV broadcast, there is generous footage dedicated to follow individual players in the games. This brings forward the emotions and situations these men go through as they attempt to reach glory. Today's TV broadcasting style, so different than that of 1986, is still inferior in quality compared to this movie.<br /><br />The players are not the only stars. The audience, the referees, the journalists covering the matches and the environment itself all play a central role in the development of what today is history. In this movie you can see how all these factors play together in a very explicit way. In that regard, today's TV broadcasting style has not yet reached this level of quality, although it is now much closer than before.<br /><br />There are several highlighted players: Maradona (Argentina), Elkjaer and Laudrup (Denmark), Francescoli (Uruguay), Platini (France), Lineker (England), Rummenigge (Germany), Butrague#o (Spain), Socrates (Brazil), and Sanchez (Mexico).<br /><br />This movie is not a collection of the best soccer moves of Mexico 1986, although most of them are well covered. Across all the movie, there is a stress for presenting several aspects of the game and the competition itself based on the progress of these players and teams, even at the cost of skipping relevant plays of the games themselves. This is what makes this movie so interesting and unique.<br /><br />Because of what happened because of referees during Mexico 1986, much of the comments about this movie and world cup are extremely Maradona-biased. Much of these comments do not take into account that there is a referee and two linesmen, that they are as human as the players, and that all of the abovementioned make mistakes one way or the other. Soccer rules do not allow referees to use TV based replays to make decisions, so for the most part referees have to decide on what they perceive. As a consequence, referees play an active part in the development of a game. Their influence can be seen in several parts of this movie.<br /><br />The sequel movie for the 1990 World Cup, compared to this one, is just a source of bitter disappointment. Much of it comes from the fact that it became too involved in the game, whereas this movie tells things from a more distant, unbiased point of view.",positive

"It was better than I thought it would be. Always good to see a Marvel movie on a big screen with a good speaker system. Glad I went see it. I almost didn't. The negative comments that the main actor said is the Real reason the negative Rotten Tomato comments were so high. That is also why I almost didn't watch this. I then focuses on the fact that Disney-Marvel did not make or stand behind the comments of the main actor. Hell, even Samual L. Jackson has made some suck ass comments off-screen. He still plays a great part. I will not punish a Franchise for the ignorance of actors. I think this Captain Marvel is important and needed for the final Avengers movie. I also saw many little girls coming out of the theater excited at seeing the movie. I am pretty sure they are not aware of the actors comments. A Childs world view is innocent. There were also many little girls waiting to go see it who where very excited. Super Hero's don't all need to be men. Don't let the Feminist B.S. ruin this for you. Watch the movie and support the Marvel Universe. Not the best Marvel Movie but definitely worth seeing!!! I wasn't disappointed. Although there were lots of little girls taken to this movie. There were men and boys there also. Just more little girls than usual. I am sure they liked seeing a woman Super Hero instead of always having to watch princess stories or other mushy stuff that is suppose to be girl movies. I believe Marvel-Disney did a good job with this. The Movie didn't attack men. It was very evenly balanced and had good and bad characters of both sexes. It wasn't a man hate movie. The main actor stepped out on her own and made these Feminist hate statements. She still did a good job acting. Support the goal of Disney and Marvel. This movie is not only an origin story for Captain Marvel. It is part of the background for the whole story being told. It fills in small areas left void in previous movies. Watch the movie. Voice your comments to Disney-Marvel directly to fix the actors breach of contract issues or poor contract agreements.

"This film powerfully demonstrates the struggle of two women in love in a culture so deeply entrenched in ritual and tradition.

"Audiences today will probably watch a film like Ossessione and not really consider how unprecedented it was during the time when it came out. The structure of the film really divorces from sap-happy Hollywood conventionsas well as other major theatrical elements. It relies more upon depicting reality in a very grim and sober light. Films of this naturethe neo-realist filmswere made to reflect the darkness felt during post-World War II times. Ossessione tackles some fairly provocative issues that were probably unseen on screen prior to the war, including: adultery, conspiracy, murder, pregnancy, etc. Aside from the one crane shot and certain musical swelling moments, the film aesthetic is very raw and gritty: shot on-location, uses natural lighting and most likely non-popular actors. All of these elements helped convey the issues explored in the film, yielding the following theme: Negative karmic repercussions will haunt those who deliberately act immorally.<br /><br />The two leadsGino and Giovannaare polar opposites, yet both carry the mentality: we're bored and we want to be entertained. Gino is a drifter; a lone traveler who embraces life and its constant fluctuations. Giovanna is a bored house-wife cemented in the familiarly of marital permanence: she doesn't want to leave her home and husband, but would rather remain where she is because it's safer. Gino's lifestyle represents the ideal lifestyle Giovanna craves; the only difference is that she's too afraid to live it herselfthat's why she falls in love with Gino: he represents everything she wants but doesn't have the courage to get. She wants to live in a world free from the monotony of living with her corpulent husbandGino is the perfect ticket into that world. The affair that ensues between the two most likely left audiences back in the 40's feeling somewhat uneasy. I mean, films prior to the neo-realist age never showed such scandalous behavior on screen before. To say the least it was probably a bit alarming.<br /><br />In conjunction with the theme, the neo-realist style helps show the negative repercussions of adulterous behavior. Succinctly put, adulterous behavior (as shown in the film) leads to depressing and ultimately deadened lives. When Gino and Giovanna conspire with each other to ""eliminate"" Giovanna's husband, karma comes to haunt them like a plague after the deed is done. They return to their home: the atmosphere is dark and biting (as can be expected from the neo-realist style). They are not happy; they're actually more depressed. They thought that by eliminating Giovanna's husband that they'd live happier lives, but they were duped. The film ends with Giovanna's deathit being in karmic similitude of her husband's death. I think this is a very satisfying ending for several reasons. Here's why.<br /><br />There's a lot of talk as to whether or not evil should be depicted on screen, and if so, to what extent. I think depicting evil is very necessary if and only if the evil depicted is not being glorified, but rather shows what negative consequences evil actions have. As the subtext of Ossessione asks, is adultery and murder evil? I think the film eagerly responds yes! The adulterous behavior between the two reveals how unhappy they are. Ironically though, towards the end of the film when they seem to be healed of their depression and are seen basking in each other's arms inside the car, the author of the film shows that their happiness is, in fact, a façade: the car crashes off the cliff and into the river, killing Giovanna; the police arrest Gino. I think it was the author's intention to say that even though people sometimes try and justify their immoral behavior, in the end karma will come back to haunt them. I agree. I think the two got what was coming to them because they both were incredibly selfishalways wanting instant gratification and not willing to endure through hard times. This was especially made clear after the first sign of difficulty that Gino and Giovanna experience in their relationship: he can't handle the pressure of living in Giovanna's husband shadow, so he leaves Giovanna and sleeps with another girl. Such is typical of the insatiable, hedonistic personality.<br /><br />All in all, the film seemed very risky for its time. The audience, however, was prepared to see such a film because of the sobriety the war brought. Those pre-war, happy-go-lucky films were no longer being believed. Movie-going audiences were ready to see and contemplate difficult films with complex characters: they wanted to see characters whose lives were entangled in so-called 'sin' because it was a reflection of their own life problems. Ossessione, then, acts as a great catalyst for where the future of film was heading. That is, a lot of the naturalism pieces we see today can be said to have been influenced by the neo-realist film movement.",positive
"I wanted to like this film, I really did. It's got some good actors but ultimately it falls flat. It tries too hard to be funny in some places (the daughters over zealous cooking attempts), over reaches in others (the scene where they clean up someone's yard, so he agrees to join the team) and has some scenes that, while mildly interesting, are really just filler (all the work scene's). And I didn't find the ""villians"" intimidating, or worth hating, so much as I found them to be childishly annoying. <br /><br />I've met people like those in the film while playing church ball. And I will say the referee's are spot on, Still, in the end, I really didn't care all that much about the characters, or their quest for church ball glory. Maybe because they were all so one dimensional, which I might not have minded so much if the film were funnier or seemed to flow a little more smoothly overall. <br /><br />Kurt Hale, and Halestorm entertainment, has made some good films, but this is not one of them.",negative

"This is a very chilling, and for the most part, a well thought out drama. I am very impressed at the film, not just for the plot and superb acting, but that such a unique movie was made. Most movies involving a spy or a war are filled with a slick talking Brit or a mighty battle, but not this. This isn't about this kind of war, its about the war between a man and his position in life, an American spy in Germany, posing as a supporter of an evil no one will ever forget. When the war is over, Campell thinks he will come home as a hero, but his true heroic stance must remain a government secret. Going back to America, Campell meets Nazi supporters as well as Nazi haters, providing for interesting conflicts, both internally and externally. Nolte more than pulls off the role, and fits the plot quite well for what it's asking.",positive

Her different style as a hero, her goals and finding her path were wonderful. nnAnd point blank, this is HOW female empowerment movies should be.  They absolutely nailed it. She's imperfect, she's not over compensating, she's powerful and confident, she's flawed and she's damaged... and free to be herself and show what she can do.  The small touches throughout brought that message home flawlessly and Bree Larson was phenomenal in this movie. nnPeople pointing to 'plot holes' in the MCU are either A, flat our liars.  Looking for something to harp on and slander the movie with.  Or B, lacking understanding or grasp of the material.

"Captain Marvel was very exciting for the eyes and packed with action. Not the funniest, much like early Thor movie's but had a few laugh moments.

"The rating goes from a 2-star to a 4-star depending on if you are previously a Ms. Marvel fan. nThere are many takeaways from this movie, so I'll try to sum them up:nThe MCU had always been brilliant at making their movies accessible to everyone. Old fans and young fans. Long time comic fans and brand new fans that ONLY know this movie universe. This is the first time they very obviously aimed the movie ONLY at new fans, and completely ignored long time fans. So if you know nothing about Carol Danvers, the Skrulls, Mar-Vell, Monica Rambeau, or various other things from Marvel Comics... this is actually a pretty good movie. WHAT they changed is pretty infuriating, but if you don't know what they changed than the takeaway of the movie is pretty decent. Some solid action, political cringe level is minimal, and (the biggest strength of the movie) there is a persistent subtle humor that keeps everything interesting. If you're a long time fan... the long and short of it is 1) prepare to nerd rage, and 2) this movie and this character will NOT remotely live up to the Carol Danvers Ms. Marvel you are probably be familiar with. It'll just leave you a hunger for them to make a ""good"" Ms. Marvel movie instead of a semi-crappy 2012 ""Captain Marvel"" rendition of Carol Danvers. nAs for the political cringe factor many were worried about, thankfully it's minimal. It's there, but minimal. A few scenes that clearly confuse BEING a badass female character with just preaching ""woo! grrl powah!"", some gender swapped characters for no reason other than ""Well we can't have her looking up to a MALE character"", and (honestly the only one that matters) a big twist in the movie that altered something important for the sake of shoehorning in a political message (won't go into it here as it'd be spoilers). nSo to re-sum up: If you've never read the comics, if you don't know how badass Ms. Marvel is, this is a 4-star movie. It's good and enjoyable. If you know ANYTHING about the comics, it's 2-star. It'll nerd rage you, it won't live up to the character you have in your mind, and it will on occasion insult you.",positive

Extremely disappointing instalment in the MCU.  Feels more like a forced character introduction than a true standalone film.  The character arc is formulaic at best and mind numbing at worst.

"Just saying you've got a movie about John Holmes is a guarantee to get some folks in front of the screen, but writer/director James Cox delivers oh so much more. A ""Rashamon"" of the sleazy Hollywood set, the film splitters the July 1981 Wonderland murders through a variety of angles (and film stocks), but mostly through the filter of John Holmes' coked out weasel brain. In a film full of bad guys Holmes is either the most vile, the most pathetic or both. Several versions of the story emerge and merge as Cox flashes jump cuts and twisting title cards amid effects and emoting. The dialogue is fast and naturalistic and never once rings false. While the film takes places two years after Holmes had fallen out of porn and into a truly wicked drug fueled depravity, Kilmer relentlessly exudes a sexuality so intense it can be measured in inches. This sexuality at its edges creates a sense of foreboding that hangs over the entire film almost as heavily as the violence at its center. Those murders are teased at through the whole film though are never clearly shown, not even at the climax,though the violence of them relentlessly infuses the whole picture and much blood is splattered across walls and crime scene photos. Once again Val Kilmer as Holmes shows he can act wacko better than anyone else working. Strutting, cringing, bragging or begging, Kilmer is constantly in character and the character is constantly a fascinating car wreck. Stand out performances beside Kilmer definitely include Ted Levine as the lead cop in the investigation and Lisa Kudrow as Holmes estranged wife. The trio of criminals Holmes falls in with include the frighteningly high energy Josh Lucas, the ever interesting Timothy Blake Nelson and an absolutely unrecognizable Dylan McDermott in a pivotal role as the teller yet another version of the murders. Cox suggests that no matter how much we learn about Wonderland, there is always a worse version possible, but looking through the debauchery surrounding it is much more fascinating than understanding the truth.",positive

"Movie is ok, not great. Some jokes don't land. Carol Danvers is over powered even before she gets full control of her powers. There's not really enough Mar-vell to explain why she's called Captain Marvel. There's some cool fight scenes, some cool visual effects but as a movie its just ok. The story isn't on the level of Black Panther, the humor and writing isn't as good as Ragnarock. The dynamic between Fury and Captain Marvel is entertaining, the 90s setting is a nice callback to block buster, Radioshack and payphones. The movie is more Iron Man 2 or Dark World than a top tier Marvel movie. Would rather of seen the transition of Carol Danvers from Ms Marvel to Captain Marvel...since that was the actual transition.",positive

What a shame that Alan Clarke has to be associated with this tripe. That doesn't rule it out however; get a group of lads and some Stellas together and have a whale of a time running this one again and again and rolling around on the floor in tears of laughter. Great wasted night stuff. Al Hunter homes in on a well publicised theme of the late 80s- that hooligans were well organised and not really interested in the football itself- often with respectable jobs (estate agent???). But how Clarke can convince us that any of the two-bit actors straying from other TV productions of low quality (Grange Hill) or soon to go on to poor quality drama (Eastenders) can for a nanosecond make us believe that they are tough football thugs is laughable. Are we really to believe that the ICF (on whom of course the drama is based) would EVER go to another town to fight with just SIX blokes?<br /><br />The ICF would crowd out tube stations and the like with HUNDREDS. Andy Nicholls' Scally needs to be read before even contemplating a story of this nature. The acting is appalling and provides most of the laughs- Oldman is so camp it is unbelievable. Most of them look as though they should be in a bubble of bath of Mr Matey. A true inspiration to anyone with a digital video camera who thinks they can make a flick- go for it.,negative

"Her bit-part as a masseuse, in the lurid sequel to the original 'Emmannuelle', evidently gave someone the bright idea of putting a spanner in the works of the French soft-core series' gambit by inverting the Caucasian carnality and casting Javan stunner Gemser in a leading role in this, the rather tame first of a series of sexploiters that became increasingly depraved as sleazier directors took on in-name-only sequels.<br /><br />Someone (and surely not the English-language over-haulers Warner?) was also anticipating an 'A Star Is Born' type meteoric rise out the results, judging by the way the actress is credited merely with the eponymous moniker of the on-screen heroine, albeit with a couple of consonants sacrificed as insurance against litigation.<br /><br />Gemser's tenure in the series saw her as an 'intrepid' photographer, allowing of course for all manner of subsequent globe-trotting adventures. But, whilst she may well have been one the very most beautiful actresses on the screen at that time, any thespian talent that may have been there to discern becomes mired in the same sort of unfeasibly facile cogitation (""I have to confess that since I've been in Africa, I find white skin less appealing..."") that was to be found in the French films.<br /><br />And in this particular entry, much to the consternation of the raincoat brigade the essence of on-screen carnality is as much to be found in puerile symbolism (pumping engine pistons!) as it is in prosaic couplings - although naturally these include generous dollops of 'exploratory' lesbianism. Connoiseurs of kitsch are however guaranteed a continuous stream of aural delights, what with such epithets of ethnographic wisdom as ""I do nothing to be a perfect black, she does everything to be a perfect white"".",negative
"I personally wasn't charmed after seeing the trailer but it turned out that it didn't show at all what the movie actually offers. I was pleasantly surprised and I would say that contrary to popular assumptions the message of the movie isn't shoved down our throat. The actress did a better job then I expected. I was ready to compromise with a bland one-sided character but honestly you could really feel the passion radiating through different aspects of the heroine. The action was top notch and it was more than just sci-fi fist fights. The story was above average thanks to its unexpected turn of events. The soundtrack was amazingly fitting and did well in supporting the setting. The comedy was abundant but thankfully not as much as in Thor Ragnarok. Of course it wasn't all laughs, it did have its fair share of teary moments and inspirational ones too. It actually did really well inspiring its viewers, definitely one of its strong points. Definitely a must watch for MCU fans since it gives an interesting look into an important part of the overall story.",negative

"A good and fun albeit flawed movie. It was enjoyable and Brie Larson is acting well with Samuel L. Jackson being great as always. However, the movie has some flaws with pacing issues, fairly flat direction and some odd and jumpy editing. A good movie but not an amazing one which will fit into the MCU welcomly. Whilst I dislike Brie's comments outside the movie she is was good in the movie if not a little bit flat in some of the moments that should be more emotional. Overall if you want a fun MCU movie with a simple but entertaining story and a new hero who is a sfx treat then this movie will surely suffice. On the other hand if you're looking for the next great Marvel movie or a cinematic masterpiece you may find it underwhelming and weak in places. 6.5/10 Enjoyable but not without it's flaws.",positive

It also does really well as a stand alone if you don't keep up with the whole marvel filmography, like my mother, who absolutely loved the film, or like the rest of my family, can spark 3 hour long discussions on how it affects the timeline of the MCU.

Miss Fontaine acted her part to perfection--she was at the same time cunning, calculating, innocent looking, frightened and charming. It takes an actress with extraordinary talent to pull that off.

"Perhaps more than many films, this one is not for everyone. For some folks the idea of slowing down, reflecting and allowing things to happen in their own time is a good description of their personal hell. For others an approach like this speaks to some deep part of themselves they know exists, some part they long for contact with.<br /><br />I suppose it's a function of where I am in my own life these days, but I count myself in the camp of the latter group. I found the meditative pace of this film almost hypnotic, gently guiding me into some realm almost mythological. This is indeed a journey story, a rich portrayal of the distance many of us must travel if we are to come full circle at the end of our days.<br /><br />Much as been written of Mr Farnsworth's presentation of Alvin Straight, though I'm not sure there are words to express the exquisite balance of bemused sadness and wise innocence he conjured for us. Knowing now that he was indeed coming to terms with his own mortality as he sat on that tractor seat makes me wish I had had the opportunity to spend time with him before his departure. I hope he had a small glimmer of the satisfaction and truth he had brought to so many people, not just for ""acting"" but for sharing his absolute humanity with such brutal honesty.<br /><br />Given the realities of production economics, I'm not sure full credit has been given Mr Lynch for the courage he showed in allowing the story to develop so slowly. An outsider to film production, I nonetheless understand there are few areas of modern life where the expression ""time is money"" is so accurately descriptive. Going deep into our hearts is not an adventure that can be rushed, and to his credit Mr Lynch seems to have understood that he was not simply telling a story--he was inviting his viewers to spend some time with their own mortality. No simple task, that.<br /><br />If you'd like to experience the power of film to take introduce you to some precious part of yourself, you could do worse than spending a couple of hours with The Straight Story. And then giving yourself some time for the next little while simply listening to its echoes in the small hours of the night.",positive

Both movies were utter rubbish.<br /><br />Whatever happened to character development? Whatever happened to meaningful dialogue? Whatever happened to ACTING? And, when watching something that vaguely purports to be ""historical"", whatever happened to attempting to capture some measure of accuracy, some realistic idea of the ""political map"" of the time, even some slight flavour of the era, especially in its social attitudes. Why do they all have to display the value set of 21st century America? I have read on the message boards of disclaimers that ""little was known"" of the dark ages. Not so.

How is it then that such a fascinating man has inspired such a boring melodramatic piece of drivel?? Ed Gein made belts out of nipples, bowls out of skulls, lamps out of skin, danced around under the moon in suits of human skin. None of this made it into the movie because they needed to give us a fictitious story of a ridiculously awful deputy and his rather homely, sex-starved girlfriend. This movie seemed to go out of its way to falsify history. What baffles me is that most movies stray from the path of truth to exaggerate history; this one seems to do it to minimize it.

"""Kalifornia"" is one of my all-time favourite movies, and it easily could be labeled as one of the best psychological thrillers of the 90`s. The film has a very stylish surface to it, but behind that are a lot of disturbing and honest depictions of homicidal maniacs and the terrifyng violence they inflict upon others. One of the film`s strongest aspects is it`s performances, Brad Pitt is startlingly great as a trailer-trash psycho named Early. Pitt potrays his frightening character almost flawlessly. Juliette Lewis is equally as good playing his naive girlfriend, her innocence is almost heart-breaking. ""Kalifornia"" has a very simple plot to it, that goes steadily and slowly forward for about an hour, but it suddenly plunges into a harrowing spree of murder, as Pitt unleashes his psychotic personality. There are alot of shocking scenes, and it all mounts to a power-house climax that will haunt you for days. ""Kalifonia"" is a film that should really be watched for it`s intense look at how monstrous a human being can be, and not only for it`s violence and gore.",positive
"I'd have given this film a few stars, simply because it was a ""Lifetime"" presentation actually filmed in the location represented in the story - here, New York City. Most on this channel, whether ""set"" there, in rural Iowa, Oregon, Virginia, L.A. etc., are filmed in Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto or some other Canadian locale.<br /><br />But if there ever were one deserving the top rating - 10* on this site, it's this movie. Certainly not for originality, for this story has been done many times, in many variations, with several very similar to this specific one. It's also been done pretty often on the big screen, with mega-stars, past and present, from Cary Grant, James Garner, Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks, et al - and Deborah Kerr, Doris Day, Meg Ryan, and many more. I can think of at least 10-12 more, just as prominent, past to present, off the top of my head, who could be added now, and there are probably many others which could be brought to mind.<br /><br />Not to drone on, but my point is that, in my opinion, this is by far one of the best of this genre I've seen. I caught it by chance on a mid-day Friday, at a time when I had the TV on only because I was taking a couple of hours following a particularly hectic week. I'd never run across this flick in the 8 years since it was made. And, while the two leads have done enough to be known to most, they were completely unknown to me. The only two actors I knew were Phyllis Newman (Anna's mother) whom I'd seen in some things from her younger days, and Michael Rispoli (Henry, Charlie's best friend) who was outstanding as ""Gramma,"" the menacing juice loan, tough, street guy from ""Rounders."" <br /><br />The chance meeting and coupling between both leads' best friends, as a sub-story romance, with the correlation of their being such to Anna and Charlie being only revealed to all later, is an oft-done plot contrivance within the genre, but makes no difference to the enjoyment here (in fact, it enhances it).<br /><br />Checking some other comments, I agree completely with those which are the most positive. The primary word describing this film is ENGAGING, in caps. This adjective describes the performers; the characters; the chemistry between and among all of the characters, in whatever combination presented, and all of the supporting and even minor roles.<br /><br />I love films with a ""harder edge:"" ""Rounders;"" the escapist Schwarzenegger/Stallone fare; ""Goodfellows;"" even the classics like ""Casablanca,"" ""Gone With the Wind,"" ""Citizen Kane."" But for pure, uncomplicated enjoyment, this one was outstanding. With a bare fraction of their budgets, it was equal to the results achieved by ""You've Got Mail"" and ""Sleepless in Seattle."" And Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan couldn't have done better than Natasha Henstridge and Michael Vartan here; the co-stars and support personnel here were equivalent to those in these mega-films, as well.",positive

"This 1981 comedy still sparkles thanks to the combined efforts of writer/director Steve Gordon and stars Dudley Moore and John Gielgud. Sadly, Gordon, only in his early forties, died soon after completing this, his only feature film. It's an especially unfortunate loss since he shows a truly deft hand at character-driven farce that makes the whole film irresistible. It plays almost like a 1930's-style screwball comedy revamped for contemporary tastes. The plot centers on Arthur Bach, a drunken, diminutive millionaire playboy who is at risk of losing his $750 million inheritance if he doesn't marry the dowdy and boring Susan Johnson, an heiress handpicked by his old-money father and dotty grandmother. Of course, he doesn't love her and by chance, runs into Linda Marolla, a working-class waitress (and of course, aspiring actress) after she pilfers a Bergdorf Goodman tie for her father.<br /><br />The standard complications ensue but in a most endearing way with loads of alcohol-fueled slapstick executed with classic élan by Moore. That he makes such a spoiled character likable is a credit not only to his comic talents but to Gielgud's feisty, acidic turn as Hobson, Arthur's devoted but reality-grounded valet. It's the type of role he could play in his sleep, but Gielgud makes Hobson such a truly memorable character that his fate in the film brings a welcome injection of poignancy in the proceedings. In probably her most likable film role, Liza Minnelli hands the picture to her male co-stars by toning down her usual razzle-dazzle personality and making Linda quite genuine in motivation.<br /><br />A pre-""LA Law"" Jill Eikenberry plays Susan just at the right passive-aggressive note, while Barney Martin (Jerry's dad on ""Seinfeld"") steals all his scenes as Linda's slovenly father Ralph. The one fly in the ointment is veteran actress Geraldine Fitzgerald, who overdoes the eccentricities of the grandmother. And I have to admit that I still can't stand the very dated, overplayed Christopher Cross song that inevitably won the Oscar for that year's best song. Unfortunately, the 1997 DVD, certainly in need of remastering, has no extras worth noting except some photos and production notes.",positive
"Before I begin, a ""little"" correction: IMDb states that Richard Gere is 180 cm tall. Wrong! I passed by him 10 years ago, and he can't be an ant's a** bigger than 165. I'm 183, and he looked like a child next to me.<br /><br />Should have been called ""Wheatlands""; an appropriate title to complement Malick's previous (and much better) movie ""Badlands"". This movie shows that not all directors have as their prime objective to entertain. In fact, some of them have as their main objective to show wheat in all its splendour.<br /><br />The movie is depressing and relatively uninvolving, with the obligatory tragic ending. Nothing more than an average and predictable love triangle drama, with the male two-thirds of the triangle not surviving the movie. Praised for its visual quality; while it does have that realistic 70s feel to it, there are limits to how spellbinding wheat fields can be. You can shoot them with 1500 mm cameras, for all I care, but they are still wheat fields.<br /><br />Gere, who at first seems miscast as some kind of lower-class factory-worker-turned-Wheatfield-worker, is quite solid, while Brooke Adams appears distant and cool for most of the movie, making one wonder just how much she loved either of the two hunks.

"Of all the movies I have seen, and that's most of them, this is by far the best one made that is primarily about the U.S. Naval Airships (Blimps) during the WW-II era. Yes there are other good LTA related movies, but most use special effects more than any real-time shots. This Man's Navy has considerably more real-time footage of blimps etc. True, lots of corny dialog but that's what makes more interesting Hollywood movies, even today. P.S.

"To anyone who actually reads this review, screw all the haters and trolls who are bashing this movie. nnHonest opinion from a white male here (the demographic most hating on this film), this movie was actually fantastic and a blast. I am a huge comics nerd and realize this movie could have been a whole lot worse should it have made Carol as bland as she is in all the comics. But no, they gave her emotions for once. And its a welcome change. The movie focused more on Carol as a person and gave her development a lot better than the Oscar winning Black Panther. I would give it a solid 8/10, but I'm giving it 10/10 here because of all the stupid trolls who are trying to ruin a good film. Captain Marvel is what super heroes should strive to be, teaching children they have the strength to be better, to go higher, further, faster.",controversial
"The key to Captain Marvel is moderated expectations. It's better than half the others. It's worse than half the others. Can't give details without spoilers. nBased on a Marvel standard, I give the following scores:nActing: 6/10 Brie Larson showed more range than Kristen Stewart and less than Anne Hathaway.nDirection: 5/10 Tone was uneven, some natural laughs, some forced humor, some good 90s moments, some forced exposition, some unnecessary and unexplained plot devices. Also, the soundtrack was forced in certain areas and a certain montage that attempts to be powerful, original and nuanced was pretty much appropriated from Joss Wheden's work in Buffy. A bit disappointed in Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck.nWriting: 6/10 The plot was good. The road to self discovery dragged on, character development lacked for certain interesting characters. Inconsistency with the SHIELD name; shield isn't known by its shorthand until Iron Man 2, yet somehow they are using it in the 90s? Certain gap explanations were underwhelming and detract from what we know of certain characters just to give us a laugh or two. Disappointed in the whole writing team.nI enjoyed it. I was entertained. I'm glad I saw it.

"Ironically, although he can do the ""splits"", Thomas is a complete stiff as an actor. <br /><br />This film is seared into my memory as one of the most side-splittingly cheesy and incompetent movies I have ever seen. As such, I'm actually rather fond of it. <br /><br />Still,the only reason this gets more than one star is that Thomas is great shape, and it's fun to see his tiny, muscular body performing various feats of gymnastic skill on the oddly shaped rocks and poles scattered about the East European country side (including the infamous ""pommel horse"" shaped well cap in the middle of a village square that Thomas uses to plant his feet in the faces of various insane villagers). But let the poor guy open his mouth and try to emote, and any illusion that he might have a film career is immediately dashed to bits. <br /><br />Thomas at least had the excuse that he wasn't really an actor. Everyone else in the film - actors, director, editor, camera guys, etc. is at least as bad, or even worse, and most of them are professionals. So Kurt doesn't come off quite as badly as you might think. <br /><br />I hope poor Kurt took the money and ran. If anyone ever asks him to perform in a martial arts film again, I'll bet that Thomas kicks the guy in the face.",negative
"I first saw it at 5am January 1, 2009, and after a day i watched it again and i want to watch it again. Love everything (well, almost, so 9 stars) about it. No color, beautiful naive stories, funny gangsters, Anna, camera work, music. Well, sometimes you just want to listen little bit longer and the music just stops. But this is not a musical after all. I like Anna's acting, this naive wannabe gangster girl, how she speaks, holds the gun, everything makes me smile. No, it's not that funny, though i have laughed a bit at some moments, it's just so subtle. Excellent work by Samuel Benchetrit. Though 3d nouvelle seems weaker, but they are also gangsters, maybe even worse, cause they are stealing ideas. And the last scene is my favorite. Makes me feel so warm and.. romantic. Yes, i would recommend this movie for the romantic souls with a taste for such art-housish movies. And i don't agree with those comparing it to Pulp Fiction. It's not about action and twisted story, though all vignettes intersect. It's calm, and maybe too slow movie for most of the people. It's about characters, their feelings, very subtle. Anyway, probably this review won't be of much help to anyone (my first), just wanted to express my appreciation.<br /><br />SPOILER: This movie doesn't have a Goofs section.

It was more real, because you saw them through the relationship, rather than the whole movie be about them getting together.

"SPOILER WARNING FOR CAPTAIN MARVELnnnnAverage action flick, below average Marvel movie. There were great moments that really show the lost potential that this movie had and long story short, Captain Marvel is at its best when its two main leads are on screen together. But unfortunately the movie has a political statement that is jarring to watch, and it almost ruined the experience first time around. But after some time and a second watch, I could see where this movie shines. nnCaptain Marvel stands as, at least to me, a contestant as the the unfortunate worst Marvel movie to date. I left the theatre the first time almost angry at what the movie tried to do and the fact that there was ANY political statement from the movie at all REGARDLESS of what side they took certainly put a dampener on my hopes for Endgame. Marvel movies should not have a political statement in them, it polarizes the audience and in the case of Brie Larson (You guys know what I'm talking about), it makes them angry before the movie is even out. Captain Marvel stands as an example to the testament that action movies should not have ANY political agendas ANYWHERE in the development process, as it causes more problems than it should. nnBut with that aside, the movie is inconsistant in quality.nn The way that they de-aged Samuel L Jackson looked phenomenal and at times I almost forgot that he was 20-30+ years older than the movie made him look. But at times the CGI in action scenes was jarring and very poorly done, almost ugly. The only movie worse in CGI quality in the MCU was Black Panther, and that says something. nnActing was all over the place. Brie Larson has her times to shine throughout the movie, and at times she sold herself as Carol Danvers, but she couldn't sell her role in serious scenes leading up to big fights. She tries to act like a Star Lord/Spider-Manhybrid with half-assed comedy lines thrown in poorly, and it almost worked, but it came off as cocky in a bad way, not in a Tony Stark way. Samuel L Jackson easily held up the movie in acting, and he had some of the best scenes overall. nnLive action fight scenes were well choreographed and entertaining to watch, but the big CGI fight scene in atmosphere at the end had some hilariously bad direction and horrible pacing. The photon blasts looked stunning however and I could easily see them occurring in real life (if that were possible) alongside the visual ques that Brie Larson gave while those blasts were being fired. Unfortunately the CGI cat scenes were poorly animated in comparison when tentacles weren't on screen. (Never thought I'd say that) nAlso the scene where music comes in during the big live action fight scene towards the end is an attempt to imitate Guardians of the Galaxy, but it comes off as jarring and out of placennHumor was great in some points but misplaced in others. It almost kept the score of the movie at 3 1/2 stars and held up the movie in the end, but it felt like the humorous scenes were misplaced and generic at worst, almost insultingly so. The cat was the best part for comic relief, aside from a truly infuriating scene that explains how Nick Fury got his eye scar.nnLastly, in terms of accuracy, it was terribly inconsistent. The Skrulls turned out to be the good guys in the end and that is completely wrong compared to the comics. Carol's powers were also inaccurately given to her, she got them from Mar-Vel's attempt to save her, not a light speed engine. In the case of gender swapping Mar-Vel, it's okay, but the offender in her/his/its case is that Mar-Vel is supposed to look Alien with purple-ish pink skin, but they decided to make it an old lady instead. They retconned a lot of the MCU, such as how the Tesaract got in Shield's hands amd how Captain Marvel is ultimately not supposed to be the strongest Avenger. (Canonically, it was supposed to be the Hulk and Thor, but after Marvel studios pushed for Captain Marvel to be it, it was shoe-horned in, hence why this movie is so inconsistent)nnOverall, Captain Marvel is best described in the words; almost, but, and jarring. The movie has marks of greatness that we see in most Marvel movies, -BUT- there are problems with acting, CGI, and poor direction. There was -ALMOST- really good comic relief in some scenes. Carol Danvers and the alien cat had some pretty -JARRING- CGI. nnYou see what I'm getting at?nnThis movie could have been great, and it had the potential to be an introduction to a great character, but in the end, terrible press on the part of Brie Larson, mediocrely animated CGI, misplaced humor at points, and inconsistency across the board hold this movie back. It had some truly great moments in it and it was at its best when Nick Fury and Carol Danvers we're on screen together. To me this movie unfortunately can't hold up to the high standards that the earlier movies placed, which is unfortunate, as Captain Marvel (or more accurately Ms. Marvel as she was once known as) is one of my favorite Marvel characters.",controversial

"Broadway and film actor-turned-director John Cassavetes (from Rosemary's Baby)creates a masterpiece with this 1977 film. It stars Gena Rowlands, John Cassavetes himself, Ben Gazzara, Joan Blondell, Paul Stewart, Zohra Lampert, Laura Johnson and there is a cameo by Peter Falk. The premise of the film: An aging stage and film actress (Gena Rowlands)re-evaluates her life after an obscessed fan dies in a car accident trying to get her autograph. The movie has a slow pace and a dark, moody, frightening quality. It has a 60's cinematic look and it even reminded me of Polanski's Rosemary's Baby without the supernatural horror. The fears here are the ones every successful actress has- she is getting old and she will become useless in her career. Furthermore, she feels she has lived a life that lacks any true spirituality, humanity and merit. She has lived only for her career- she has no children, doesn't do charitable deeds, etc. The gradual disintegration of her personality is the meat of this film. She is falling apart. She's in a crisis. Gena Rowlands really gets into the character's tormented psyche and acts the part quite well. She is a terrific actress and this 70's film is a refreshing contrast to the often violent films of the period and or the disaster movies or adventure thrillers. It's a movie with lots of deep-seated emotion but has a cold, cynical feeling, as if Cassavetes is criticizing the mainstream movies and actors of the 70's generation. Either that or this movie is a product of the 70's which was itself cynical in many aspects- Nixon's deception, Watergate, Vietnam, etc. Although the production values are not great, and this film is not well-known, it's a very haunting film with haunting moods. Kudos to the underrated and late director Cassavetes who died in the late 80's.",positive
"... and I DO mean it. If not literally (after all, I have not seen every movie ever created!), at least, obviously, among the ones, the many I know.<br /><br />5.3 ??? The rule of thumb with IMDb is this: sometimes movies rated very highly (for example, the piece of Kannes-Kompetition-Krowned-Korean-Kraap called ""Oldboy"") can be truly bad. But rarely a movie worth watching is actually rated under 6. This movie, very much worth watching, is. A disgrace.<br /><br />True, I give it a 10 in protest. The movie is not perfect. Its true rating should be an 8 or a 9. It has some acting flaws (Belafonte especially), the script wanders around, sometimes. However, what we have here is one of the greatest directors of all times, the Czech Jan Kadar, directing two of the greatest actors of all time, the beloved, larger-than-life Zero Mostel and the sublime Ida Kaminska in an acting/poetic/moral tour de force. A pair made in Heaven! It's true that this movie, little flaws apart, does not pander to the average audiences, but those interested in watching an excellent (while, again, not beyond criticism) movie of the incomparable director who gave us ""The Shop on the Main Street"" (the best movie ever about Holocaust) should not miss this just because some silly IMDb rating system decides that ""American Beauty"" is better than ""The Angel Levine"".<br /><br />It isn't.",positive

"Initially, the movie's premise was interesting, filled with age old device of potentially and soon enough ""great"" hero(oine) but then it gave away with very loose script nd a unmissable political undertone of our times, seriously ppl, I mean come on, it's just a superhero movie and can't you keep it that way, why making everything political ( though you are free to do it, and I am free to criticize it). The action sequence were not nothing new and with many predictable sequences, though new visual effects but I guess that's a standard we can expect from Marvel. nFrankly speaking, it would have been great movie provided the script would have been far more tighter with little complexity minus political undertone as end of the day it becomes plainly harebrained with nothing to root for the characters.nnPS: I think Thor's ragna rock nd winter solider is the best marvel movie ..",positive

"The opening intro was a beautiful tribute to Stan Lee, The beginning of the movie was surprisingly well done, I enjoyed a lot of the Kree world and the Dialogue between Brie Larson and Jude Law in the beginning, highly expecting him to be MARVELL (Wait for it). The pacing slowed down a bit as the skrulls captured carol and she escaped to earth, Then Brie Larson stopped being intriguing in the beginning and was pretty bland of a character afterwards, even in some fight scenes and dialogue between her a Sam L Jackson fell flat for me, the humor in the movie although a riot didn't flow well, a lot of it was random. The action sequences were average at best like a basic marvel movie such as Thor. I will give it some praise it wasn't boring it was entertaining, but I don't see the hype surrounding this movie as some critics would call it a game changer? Nothing about this movie made it a game changer. Without political bias affecting my review I'll give this movie a 3/5. Go watch it",negative
"From the very opening scene you will notice just how hard they tried to mimic the very smart and powerful 'Cruel Intentions', and how flat it landed. You'll also notice what a terrible choice they made by casting Robin Dunne as Valmont... Then in the second scene, you meet the two best things in this movie, Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers as Kathryn and her mother. That is, if you can get past the fact that Kathryn wasn't blonde in the first film... Then the movie goes on, you see the cheap romantic story from miles ago, and you notice Sebastian has already met an Anette in the past, here called Danielle, and a Cecile, here called Cherie... How original is that for a prequel. Then it turns into a low budget 'Wild Things' type of film with lots and lots of oh-my ""twists"". As I mentioned, Robin Dunne was a very bad choice. Not that he is a bad actor, he's good.. He just doesn't have the charisma Ryan did. Amy Adams, who is in my opinion one of the most talented young actresses of our time, once again delivers. But with all the talent in the world, there is no way one could save this trash. As a whole, this ""movie"" feels like a 'Beverly Hills, 90210' episode. The score has been stolen from 'Cruel Intentions' and 'Jawbreaker'... Yes, they used the score from JAWBREAKER... Couldn't they at least leave that one alone?! You'll want to pass this one. If you want more Cruel Intentions, watch Stephen Frears' Dangerous Liaisons.",negative
"I only recently found out that Madeleine L'Engle's novel had been turned into a TV movie by Disney and ordered the DVD. The book was a favorite of mine when I was a child and I read it several times.<br /><br />Despite some of the child actors not resembling the characters as described in the novel, the Murry family is well cast, with a likable (if too pretty) Meg at the center and a Charles Wallace who is convincing as a child prodigy without becoming irritating. <br /><br />The first half hour is promising enough, doing a good job in establishing the relationships between the lead characters and at setting the scene. Unfortunately as soon as the non-human characters appear the adaptation starts to unravel and once the children leave earth the whole thing falls apart. Alfre Woodward is too youthful looking and much too regal as the eccentric Mrs Whatsit (think Miriam Margolis or Joan Plowright instead) and Kate Nelligan face is so mask like and inexpressive, she must have visited Faye Dunaway's plastic surgeon in recent years. For some reason they make her Mrs Which look like Glinda from The Wizard of Oz when she should have resembled a benign Wicked Witch of the West.<br /><br />In the end what lets this down most badly are the terrible special effects and art direction. I understand that this is a TV movie, but the CGI looked like something that could have been done 15 years earlier. Mrs Whatsits' centaur incarnation is a disaster as is the Chewbacca like suit for Aunt Beast, who in the novel is a velvety, elegant creature instead of the ungainly Big Foot like thing shown here. I could go on and on, nearly every artistic choice is a disaster, presumably because there wasn't a large enough budget to do this justice, but also because the design work lacks imagination and good judgement.<br /><br />This really would have needed the sense of wonder Spielberg brought to his early films. What a shame that with the current popularity of adapting children's literary fantasy series nobody thought of adapting A Wrinkle in Time and it's sequels for the big screen, giving it the scope it deserves.",negative

"If I could give this movie lower, I would. It is sad really. I would have loved a good Captain Marvel movie, as she is a great character. The story is a mess, with so many issues that don't make sense. Also Brie is very bland in this. Most of the MCU cast have put in strong performances since the first movie and she fails to live up to the lowest bar. nnAlso, I understand that Nick Fury in this movie is 'young' but they have made him this, comic relief character who loses his eye to an alien cat because it scratched him. Nick Fury is a badass. There are -0s of amazing things you could have done with meaning and depth instead of this. Good job.nnI'm not bothered too much by the empowering scenes for women in this. At points they do seem forced but they are in the 70s, 80s and 90s I think? nnI liked the Skrulls but thought the Kree were, meh. Illogical and dumb. I want smart, well written villains. At the end of the movie, it would have been much better if Captain Marvel beat Jude Laws character in a fist fight rather than the blast. It would have been more impressive. nnActually, one thing with the Skrulls I didn't like was their plan. They are willing to sacrifice -0s--00s of their kind, to find a few dozen, by hopefully luring the Kree to the planet their on, and hopefully they bring Captain Marvel, and HOPEFULLY she gets separated and they can hopefully capture her. Also hopefully they can find info they need. nnHonestly, some funny 90s jokes here and there but not enough for me to actually say this is a good movie. When a movie or series has a character who learns nothing throughout the movie, acts like they know everything and seems to, just because, and remains almost emotionless throughout and is depicted poorly due to bad acting.. its not a good movie/series. Captain Marvel is an excellent character. She is strong and a symbol. She still has to learn things along the way. Everyone does. I also want to say, naming the Avengers after her is just so so dumb and all that B.S with the Tesseract was somewhat nonsensical. ",negative

I guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.<br /><br />The case had a couple of those little award winner/nominations symbols on it, so I figured it couldn't be too bad.

I guess if you see this movie as a stand alone it's quite o.k. but as a part of the MCU universe it's generic at best.

"This light hearted comedy should be enjoyed for entertainment value.

Another great performance is given by Laura San Giacomo. She is such an intriguing actress. Her performances take one by surprise. She delivers no matter what role she is asked to give - from wacko in Stephen King's ""The Stand"" to her television performances. However, ""Checking Out"" allows her to shine. It is a role she is meant to play. The film is brilliantly directed by Jeff Hare. He was able to bring out the best in his cast and his direction - in every aspect - made the film a wonderful treasure. Jeff Hare was able to make a difficult theme laughable and yet profound.

She was referring to the critics which seem to be completely detached from reality right now, and constantly at odds with the audience. This triggered a ton of nerds, who feel that anything featuring a strong female lead is too ""woke"", and instantly took it personally (even though she wasn't talking about them). And now this movie keeps getting hatred from audience votes. An honest, unbiased review? A good origin movie on par with all the other Marvel introductory films. Similar standard to Iron Man 1, Captain America 1, and Thor 1. No better or worse than any of those, and hopefully a good introduction to the next phase, where there will be earthbound stories, and others set in space to account for the different scales of power.

"Okay, I'll admit right up front that the Inki cartoons made by Loony Tunes are pretty offensive and I can understand why Warner Brothers has pulled them off the market. Seen today, the huge-lipped and very stereotypical Inki is not politically correct. However, the cartoons were well-made and it's a shame they aren't released with some sort of explanatory prologue (such as the one with Leonard Maltin they included with some recent politically incorrect Donald Duck cartoons that were recently released on DVD). In other words, throwing out the cartoons completely is to forget our history. Plus, Inki, Little Black Sambo and other racist cartoons are out there--especially on the internet.<br /><br />This Inki cartoon has our little hero out hunting. At first, he's chasing a cute little caterpillar but later accidentally happens upon a lion--a lion that is more than happy to make Inki his dinner. However, through all this, a weird Minah appears again and again...and eventually you'll see why this bird is so important to the story.<br /><br />Cute, well made and clever. I like the Inki cartoons. Plus, I take pleasure in showing them to extremely thin-skinned liberal friends just to watch them have apoplectic fits or even heart attacks. Loads of fun, folks!",positive

"Sigh, why couldn't this have been good.  Objectively speaking, viewing this movie outside of the established MCU, this movie is epicly boring. I can't even say it's a bad movie necessarily because that would imply that it made me feels something. Sam Jackson was the best part of this film. Brie Larson was a block of wood, whether that's her fault of the director it doesn't matter. She has like 2 emotions that she defaults to during this movie, and a lot of times just comes off as an unlikable jerk. The little girl in this movie acts circles around Brie. The plot has little focus, and the villian of the movie can't be pinned down to a single person, but more so this ideology of oppression that she has to overcome in this movie. Having said that, she doesn't really have a character arc in this movie. She ends the movie as the same character she started as. Her only change is she just gets the physical restraint on her powers lifted, and then we get to see her destroy everything in a horrible cgi sequence, that makes her look like the red and blue version of Ryan Reynolds green lantern. In the context of the MCU, it actually gets a little infuriating. They change the cannon around involving the tesseract, they change the character she was supposed to inherit the title of Captain Marvel from, and they essentially remove all chances for a secret invasion movie. The worst thing, however, is what they did to Nick Fury. I said Sam Jackson was the best part of this movie, and that is true, but only because he is a great actor and had fun with the role. The Fury in this movie doesn't even resemble Fury from the rest of the series. Yes I know he's young in this, but he was already a combat vet, and had done wet work for secret intelligence. There was no excuse to turn him into a bumbling idiot. And the explanation for how he loses his eye is beyond insulting, and lowers the intelligence of everyone who had to see it. Overall this movie is a bland shoehorned mess, and is not required in the least to see endgame. It honestly makes me worried about how much involvement her character is going to have in the movie.",negative
"When DEATHTRAP was first released, the poster--reproduced on the cover of this DVD--offered a graphic akin to a Rubik's Cube. It is an appropriate image: originally written for the stage by Ira Levin, who authored such memorable works as ROSEMARY'S BABY and THE STEPFORD WIVES, the play was one of Broadway's most famous twisters, and under Sidney Lumet's direction it translates to the screen extremely well.<br /><br />DEATHTRAP is one of those films that it is very difficult to discuss, for to do so in any detail gives away the very plot for which it is famous. But the opening premise is extremely clever: Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is the famous author of mystery plays, but these days he seems to have lost his touch. After a particularly brutal opening night, an old student named Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) sends him a script for a play he has written. It is called ""Deathtrap,"" and Sidney recognizes it as a surefire hit. Just the sort of hit that would revive his career... indeed, a hit to die for. And when Clifford visits to discuss the play, events suddenly begin to twist in the most unexpected manner possible.<br /><br />Like Anthony Shaffer's equally twisty SLEUTH, DEATHTRAP is really a story more at home on the stage than the screen--to reach full power it needs the immediacy that a live performance offers. Still, under the expert guidance of director Sidney Lumet, it makes a more-than-respectable showing on the screen. Much of this is due to the cast, which is remarkably fine. Michael Caine gives a truly brilliant performance, Dyan Cannon is funny and endearing as Sidney's relentlessly anxious wife, and Christopher Reeve gives what might be the single finest performance in his regrettably short acting career. If you can't see it in a first-rate theatrical production, this will more than do until one comes along.<br /><br />Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",positive

"It begins with a couple of disgusting sex-comedy gags, but soon it reveals its true colors: it wants to be a ""Death Wish"" clone.

From a love scene in a room inexplicably filled with candles, to ""heroes"" who dress up as commandoes and wave their machine guns because they don't want to attract attention to themselves(!), to bad guys who drive around the city in a black van long after it has been recognized as their vehicle, this film has too many ludicrous points to fit in a list. The other major problem is that you can't tell most of the characters apart; of course, you know who Borgnine and Roundtree and even James Van Patten are, but all the other roles could have been played by different actors in various scenes, and you wouldn't know the difference.

What is important in our life? Can you live without paying attention to the political changes? Is the protagonist guilty or not? These questions are more up to date than in the last 60 years.

"As an individual movie it's b;and but serviceable. As a piece of the over arching MCU, it's damaging. Anyone that tells you this is trash is lying and so are the people saying it's a triumph. As a standalone movie, Capt. Marvel is bland but serviceable. The only one having any fun is Sam Jackson which, normally I'd be into but this instantly trusting, overly friendly and forthcoming Fury is the antithesis of the roll in universe up to this point. nnMany plot holes others have raised are explained, though briefly and with a tell not show mentality.nnMy biggest problem is the way this movie undercuts key moments from the rest of the universe. As an example, Fury's appearance does not jive with his other appearances, primarily in tone but also as the result of a previously unknown character defining experience being used as punchlines. Captain Marvel herself has no arc. We are told she has trouble controlling her powers. It is my assumption that this was merely a lie to keep her under control but with that gone, I see no means for tangible growth from her. She is just as quick to trust her previous enemies as she was to trust those tho betrayed her. She does maintains her snarky one second/more serious that anyone has ever been ever the next acting gives me whiplash. Possibly a directing failure but it stands out none the less. nnAgain, this movie is not terrible. It's not great either. If you want to watch stuff explade and listen to 90's songs thrown on top you'll have a great time. you'll forget it by the time you leave the theater but could be worse.

"I originally saw this movie as a boy at the old Rialto Theatre as part of a Saturday afternoon matinée triple bill which also featured Vincent Price's ""Last Man on Earth"" and Mario Bava's ""Nightmare Castle."" I had nightmares about blood lusting ghosts for a week afterwards! Though I didn't know it then, all three movies would prove to be classics of the genre. No wonder I was so scared! Though all three films frightened me, it was Castle of Blood that had the most profound impact.<br /><br />It was the first on the bill. I didn't even get to see it from the beginning as we were late getting to the cinema and missed the first 20 minutes of the movie. That's lot to miss since the edited print only ran about 79 minutes (the unedited runs 87minutes). But despite this, the dark creepy atmosphere (complete with ruined castles, fog enshrouded cemeteries, shadows and cobwebs), Gothic set design, strong acting, and suspense (especially the last 20 minutes) scared the bejeepers out of me and made a lasting impression It took me years to finally get a copy of the film for my collection. Since it was a French - Italian import, it wasn't a movie that showed up on the late show in Winnipeg. I couldn't quite remember the title (remember I didn't get to seen the beginning of the film and was scared witless), and to make matters worse, the film had been released under literally a dozen different movie titles (aka Danze Macabre, Coffin of Terror, Castle of Terror, Long Night of Terror, etc...) and the USA/UK working title ""Castle of Blood"" was very generic, similar to dozens of other ""b"" horror and suspense films, making it illusive. But thanks to the internet and perseverance, I found it at last! What a treat to finally watch the film in its entirety after so many years! It may not have had quite the sheer emotional impact that it did when I was a boy, but as haunted house movies go, it's stands up well and compares favourably to similar iconic films of the period such as ""The Haunting,"" ""The Innocents"" or ""Black Sunday,"" The film is a fine early effort of Italian director Antonio Margheriti. It stars 60's scream queen icon Barbara Steele and features a well written screenplay by Sergio Corbucci about a sceptical writer (Georges Riviere) who, on a bet, spends the night in haunted house and unsuspectingly becomes part of an annual ongoing ghostly story. The hypnotic Steele is well cast as the ghostly love interest - as is Arturo Dominici as Dr. Carmus, and Margarete Robsahm as Julia.<br /><br />Many of the tricks Margheriti employs to create the film's eerie atmosphere (cobwebs, creaking doors, fog, etc) are bound to seem cliché to a modern audience, but they work far more effectively in black and white than they ever could in modern day colour. Rather than using body counts and special effects, the film creates scares the old fashion way, relying on a good story, stylish direction, fine set production, interesting camera work, and strong acting performances. Margheriti does a marvellous job taking these elements and building the film's suspense as the horrifying paranormal secret of the house gradually reveals itself to the unwitting writer.<br /><br />The film is not without faults. The pace drags at the beginning of the film (ironically, the 20 minutes I originally missed). This is probably worsened by Synapse films effort to restore the film to its original length. Though fans will likely appreciate the chance to see the film restored - in terms of the intro - it may have been more of hindrance than a help. The English voice dubs are merely passable and, in the restored scenes, the language shifts from English to French (English subtitles provided) which is sure to be annoying to some viewers.<br /><br />However, Synapse Films deserves kudos for the quality of the print. Clearly some effort was put into its restoration and deservedly so.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film immensely and highly recommend it to aficionados of 60's Italian Goth films, or anyone who enjoys a good ghost story.<br /><br />Rob Rheubottom Winnipeg, MB Canada",positive

"Having seen the first ten episodes, I must say this show sucks. <br /><br />What bothers me the most, is that the show was shot in Canada. I know it's cheaper, but they should have shot it in California, so we could have had scenes in the desert. That would have been more true to the movie. The first scene where they are outside in another world is in the mountains, with lots of pinetrees where it looks cold. That does'nt feel very Egyptian. What worked so well in the movie was that it felt like you were in the ancient Egypt. Here it feels like they're running around fighting aliens in a Canadian forrest. And it's so lame that appaerantly, on other planets, the fall comes as well. You can see leaves on the ground in the forrests that all look like forrests outside Vancouver. It just makes the show even more unbelievable and dumb. <br /><br />And then there is Richard Dean Anderson. He is no Kurt Russel. Sure he does a decent job and he tries to copy Russels performance a little bit, but he is just not as cool as Russel. And not nearly as good an actor as Russel. And Russells way of playing O Neill, well he was much more cynical. Andersons O Neil, is way too soft. I liked it that Russels version just did'nt give a s*** and had no trouble detonating the bomb until the very end of the movie. <br /><br />Michael Shanks does a really good job as Jackson though taking over from James Spader.<br /><br />Teal'c is a really annoying character. He is Jaffa. Not a Jaffa. Just Jaffa. Aaaarrgh!! A former bodyguard of a pathetic Ra character, seen only in the pilot and in one other episode so far. Teal'c speaks talks and acts like a robot. I've seen better acting from Jean Claude Van Damme.<br /><br />And the fact that Teal'c and the Ra character and the people they saved in the movie, can speak English all of a sudden is also incredibly dumb. What made the aliens so scary in the movie was that they spoke an ancient language and were real monsters. <br /><br />As for the special effects, they are really good in the pilot. But the very rare effects in the actual show are badly done and looks cheap. Especially a planet they visit with crystals. It's so obvious they walk around on a soundstage with a badly made painting in the background. It's an insult to us viewers that they made it look so cheap. Especially when they could have made it in front of a bluescreen with cgi backgrounds. <br /><br />The X-files had better effects when they aired their first episodes in 1993. That was 4 years before SG-1 started. And they did'nt have the apparent two million dollar budget per episode, that SG-1 supposedly had. They must have spend all the money on catering. Because I don't see it on the screen. <br /><br />Incredibly boring and pointless show, that could have been great if they had shot the show in Hollywood with a bigger budget and better writers and better characters.",negative

Being a Gen-Xer, it was a nice to finally see the mid-ninties shown in a sentimental way, though I think the music was a little to gratuitous and seemed out of place at times.nnCons:nnCharacter development. Unfortunately, what could've been heralded (and has been) as being Marvel's answer to DC's Wonder Woman, suffers irreversibly from shallow character development of our heroine. Brie Larson's acting is actually quite good contrary to some reviews but is crippled by lazy writing and, in my opinion, hohum directing.nnI didn't really feel for Cap Mar much at all and her plight was not an emotional one, especially when it's considered that her whole life has been one big, fat lie. Some breathing room with genuine emotional reflection by Cap Mar would have helped this big time. Instead, our supe is reduced to flat one-liners  as she goes through the motions like a high schooler trying to finish her shift at the McDonald's.nnI also found the veiled attempt at addressing the contemporary border and immigration debate to be insulting to both sides of the issue, if only because it seemed forced, convoluted, and made immigrants seem like shape-shifting, green creatures from outer space (yeah...just wow, man...why, why even try?).nnAll in all, I had fun time eating popcorn on my birthday with my wife. My wife, who had no idea what to expect, not being familiar with the character at all, was totally into it, as they say. I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed, only because Captain Marvel could've been so much more.",negative

"Which do you think the average person would know more/less about: Iranian cinema or Iranian football? Interestingly, the two come to the forefront of controversial Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi's latest film entitled 'Offside', a tale that uses football or access to football as a backdrop for a series of scenes revolving around one's right to do something or go somewhere and an individual's right to extend that courtesy if and when they'd like to. The odd thing is, you don't come away from Offside having learnt about Iranian football or too much about Iranian cinema (unless it's an education in Panahi's controversial style), but you do come away feeling enlightened, that at least someone from Iran has taken a controversial issue that is clearly still very much in force in a nation like Iran, and is willing to present it to an international audience rather than exploit it.<br /><br />I can remember the 2006 World Cup, I'm sure many people can. It was the summer after my initial year out at university and after the slog that was my first year, a summer of World Cup football acted as a nicely timed tonic. Needless to say, I saw practically every game bar the ones they show simultaneously with the other ones at the very end of the group stages so that to avoid incidences as seen in Spain '82 when it was thought West Germany and Austria transpired to get a result between them that would see them both through at the expense of Algeria.<br /><br />Anyone in Britain that was watching the BBC's broadcast of the Iran  Mexico game, both nations' first of the tournament, may remember that at the top of the show, the BBC's football anchorman Gary Lineker let off a snide comment to introduce the match. It went something like: 'We've seen giants Germany, England, Argentina and Holland play but now we get to see.........Mexico and Iran battle it out'. The emphasis on the latter two being inferior was clear and that maybe watching them was a chore. It's a shame because there are people, and films like Offside present them, who are really willing to see Iran play to the point where they risk their well-being to achieve it and it's sad when people in a position of power dismiss what they deem 'inferior' when there are others who'd do anything to have the chance to otherwise engage.<br /><br />When immediately thinking of the words 'Iran', 'football' and 'World Cup', my mind flies back to the France '98 game between said nation and America. Here is a film about a World Cup game of sorts involving Iran but where some or indeed most Iranian filmmakers may well have opted to present a tale revolving around Iran's famous victory over The United States and what that meant to them, director Panahi chooses to look at what goes on behind the scenes and presents a story from the stands as women are barred from football matches and are not allowed to live the ecstasy of winning a game of immense magnitude. You can imagine a heavy handed film detailing Iran's 'victory' as a lumbering propaganda film designed to exploit as they 'defeat' a Western power or 'enemy' at a sport they perhaps were not expected to do so in.<br /><br />A couple of films that spring to mind when it comes to beating the unbeatable at their own game are 2001 Indian film 'Lagaan', in which the Indian peasants defeat the ruling British at cricket. Similalry, 2005's 'The Game of Their Lives' sees the Americans defeat the English at a football match only this time in the 1950 World Cup. The differences between these films and Offside are immense; Offside is looking at a situation behind a state's mentality and dares to explore an essence of Feminism as the girls, trying to see their beloved Iran defeat Bahrain and qualify for the World Cup, are rounded up like animals and kept in a crude purgatory mere feet from a barred window that would allow them to see the game. The reasoning is to do with the foul language the men 'may', not will, but 'may' use during the game. The film presents Iran as so incompetent that they cannot take away a man's right to swear and ban the bad language but must ban a woman's right to see the game all together  it is no wonder Panahi's film was itself banned in Iran.<br /><br />But Panahi remembers to include what makes the rule so crazy in the first place by frequently allowing his female characters to both smoke cigarettes and use mobile phones, two things the doctors and scientists will have you think are far more dangerous to the human body/mind than hearing a little bit of foul language at a football match. Panahi pays special attention to the title of his film 'Offside' which itself is a ruling within football detailing when an 'attacker' is 'caught' trying to gain an advantage in the field of play. The parallels run with the womens' position in the film as these advancing (supposedly without right) individuals are caught trying to put one over the opposition team; that being the state itself.<br /><br />I think Offside is one of the better films to come out of the Middle East and surrounding Gulf area that I've seen. It's a tense but humbling film about people who do not carry any acting history according to the IMDb and thus, the acting is raw and real adding that quaint neo-realist aura to it all. The immediate ending is haunting and the constant verbal battle between the male soldiers and female wrong-doers who dared to defy the state is wonderful. I also think for anyone to actually dislike the film for the reasons I've mentioned shows a distinct level of callous, either that or you work in the Iranian government.",positive

"I found this a very entertaining small kids movie that actually is geared more for adults with a lot of jokes and humor only they would understand. A few things are inappropriate for the kiddies, but just a few. Othewise, ""The Grinch"" (Jim Carrey) cracks so many jokes you can't keep up with them all, ranging from sexual to cultural to insider-Hollywood to racial.<br /><br />The film is very colorful and looks great on DVD. The little girl in here, ""Cindy Lou Who"" (Taylor Momsen) is really cute and the costumes and hairdos of the little people in here are fun to view. Anthony Hopkins' voice is pleasing, too, so having his narrate this elevates the movie further. His rhymes are fun to hear.<br /><br />I saw this in the theater, though it was ""fair,"" but on DVD, it was far better. I've seen in three times and it got better each time.",positive

"Interesting concept that just doesn't make it. I watched the whole movie, but had to read IMDb comments to find out what Code 46 meant. If/when it was explained in the film, I must have been in a coma, or possibly brain-dead by then. I only watched it for Tim Robbins. The fact that I did not know any of the other actors should have been a tip-off. We all have to start somewhere, but this film should not be it. As to the 'anti empathy virus virus'-Holy Utility Belt, Batman! Where were The Joker, The Riddler, etc? Also, why are the women all so damned ugly?

"What I expected, at the very least, is a solid entry in my favorite superhero franchise with a fairly decent story, but the movie, and the script in particular, really has some serious issues: a first act that is nearly unwatchable incoherent mess that's littered with an unbelievable poorly-edited scenes, major pacing issues, a blatantly generic origin story, shamelessly stolen, and also underdeveloped, themes and plot-lines from other movies, a glaring lack of a fixed tone, unremarkable, and sometimes even incomprehensible, action sequences, exposition-heavy dialogue, flimsy characterization, to name but a few.nnLet alone tons of absurd and cringe-worthy stuff: paying homage to the '90s by showing slow loading processes and not-working web pages, a pandering to diversity through the movie's so-called messages in a most heavy-handed, and superficial way, outdated CGI, some of the corniest and cheesiest lines, etc.nnAs much as I love this franchise, the humor in MCU usually doesn't work for me as it does for many people. But I can't remember not chuckling even once during every one of these movies. In Captain Marvel, though, I swear that I didn't even smile for one time!nnAlso, I hate to say it, but Brie Larson is really stone-faced here. I just want to let you know that her Oscar-winning performance in Room is one of my all-time favorite performances by an actress!nnWhat I liked:nnThe de-aged Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury is incredibly impressive.nGoose the cat is just a scene-stealer.nI didn't expect the plot-twist, to be honest. (I wasn't invested in the story in even the slightest degree, though).nThe first act is stupidly chaotic and fast-paced that didn't bore me for a second. So that's a plus... I guess!nThe second act is interesting at some points, and it's when the story begins to find its footing.nIt's not a boring movie overall. In fact, it's quite enjoyable, except for the absurdly overlong third act that almost made me want to skip and fast forward till I get to the very end.nnnOverall, Captain Marvel is a soulless and bland sci-fi/action movie, and an undeniably second-tier superhero flick that doesn't deserve to be among most of the installments in an otherwise Marvel franchise.nn(5/-)",negative

Captain Marvel is so BAD, I now refuse to give marvel anymore money so they can keep PROJECTILE VOMITING out these movies to make toys and sell t-shirts. nDon't waste your hard earned money or precious time.

"The first two-thirds of this biopic of fetish model Betty Page are very interesting. Betty, as portrayed with enormous sincerity by Gretchen Mol, comes across as a pleasant, girl-next-door type, who saw nothing wrong with what she did (and there certainly wasn't anything ""wrong"" with it). Director Mary Harron, who also made ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" and ""American Psycho"", recreates Betty's America by mixing old black and white stock footage with new, degraded, black and white footage. Once Betty lands in Florida and starts working with Bunny Yeager, color is introduced. Betty's notoriety was mostly the result of her work with Paula and Irving Klaw (Lili Taylor, in a great performance, and Chris Bauer), as well as John Willie (Jared Harris). The scenes where Harron recreates Betty's bondage photography sessions are fascinating and adroitly executed. The early purveyors of fetish material are not portrayed too condescendingly and we get a sense that these folks were part of a tight ""community"". Betty never had too much of a problem with her notoriety, although we get the impression that her reputation prevented her from gaining legitimacy in the straight acting world. Because the film's third act is virtually non-existent, we are left with the impression that we have been watching a feature length documentary on Betty Page rather than a structured drama. Flaws aside, it's a film well worth catching and represents yet another fine feather in the cap of producer Christine Vachon.",positive

"at first i thought 'nasaan ka man' might be one of those progressive new filipino films. as someone noted earlier, the movie does not look poorly made. it's clear that the directors used more expensive cameras to shoot, better angles, better sound equipment, good-looking actors, and nicer locations.<br /><br />however, the improvements are all purely superficial. if it weren't for all the polish and expensive filters, 'nasaan ka man' would feel just like your typical, second-rate local movie - - hyperactive drama, predictable plot twists, ""yeah right!"" moments, crying, screaming, and characters you could care less about, all shoved down your throat.<br /><br />a couple of things annoyed me about this movie. first of all, since when is it okay to have sex with adopted family? that not-blood-related argument does not make an ounce of difference. second, would a woman really not tell anyone for 40 years that she was raped, simply because the father told her to keep it secret? and, where the hell were the lights in this movie? i know the director tried to make things look super dramatic, but i was simply forced to turn up the brightness feature on my TV set.",negative

"The Last Jedi is an emotionally complex, deeply philosophical movie with great lightsaber duels, spaceship dogfights, and actual humor. Yeah, it's REALLY that good. Anchored by some truly remarkable performances, and a host of good to great ones, the people are both more believable and more important than the effects, and the effects are amazing . Mark Hamill's turn as Luke Skywalker will be on my list of best performances of the year: he is funny, heart breaking, and legendary, it is the best acting this series has ever seen. Carrie Fisher's performance is wonderful, but the tragedy of her loss was impossible for me to separate, but it is a perfect farewell if it is her last appearance. The new heroes and villains carry the story and make it clear that the Force is still with Star Wars and the rebellion. If you don't love this movie, you don't like Star Wars, you like the Star Wars you have in your head not the one that exists. A great movie on its own terms, The Last Jedi is without question either the best, or alongside The Empire Strikes Back, one of the best this series has given us.

"The fact that most of the budget for this presumably went on the heavy-duty cast list shouldn't have mattered if it had been staged with flair and imagination and some sympathy for the original's satirical intent. Instead we get risibly bad song and dance sequences featuring picturesque beggars and whores, and the final alienation is accomplished by pulling back to reveal the action has taken place on a music-hall stage, appropriately enough for a production that's more Lionel 'Oliver' Blair than Brecht. The acting talent is shamefully misused: Migenes and Walters are good but don't have to try very hard: Migenes at least has a great voice and some feel for the material. Julia looks perfect as Mack, but struggles with the character, straitjacketed by a fake plummy accent. Harris's Peachum is embarrassingly mannered and Polly is atrocious. The adaptations of lyrics, script and music are often awkward: it was a bad move to base the film on Marc Blitzstein's bowdlerised Broadway version, but at least his words were singable, unlike most of what's been interpolated in gestures of faithfulness. And the attempt at overcoming the low budget by filming at claustrophobic angles on mist-shrouded sets lit in garish blues and oranges as if by some bargain-basement Vittorio Storaro fails utterly -- the film just looks cheap, shoddy and thoughtlessly made. Disgraceful.",negative
Just terrible. Worst MCU movie ever. I'm sure Disney wish they had a redo on this one. Really missed the ball on casting Captain Marvel. Wasn't connectable.

"I watched the 219 minute version and have to say that dollar-for-dollar, it it probably one of the worst films ever. Now I am NOT saying it's THE worst film ever--but if you look at a ratio of cost over how much an average person would enjoy it, this is a very, very bad film.<br /><br />I would say that the single biggest factor making this a bad film is the writer/director, Michael Cimino. Rarely can so much blame be placed on a single person. Had he not been so self-indulgent, a film just as bad could have easily been made at about 90 minutes--saving the studio millions! <br /><br />The film begins with a completely unnecessary prologue that's supposed to be set at Harvard. The scene is HUGE but completely without context. You have no idea exactly what is occurring nor do you know why the students (in particular, John Hurt) are behaving so boorishly. I find it very hard to imagine a commencement going like this in 1870--and it looks a lot more like 1970. This is a half hour where you have no idea what is happening, who the characters are or their motivations. <br /><br />The next scene is 20 years later. Inexplicably, the two Harvard grads (Hurt and Kris Kristofferson) are in Wyoming. So, they went to the best school in America and now one is only a law man in the middle of no where and the other is....well, what IS John Hurt in the film?!?! He just appears here and there and seems to be either a jerk (the prologue) or a pathetic and pointless drunk who hangs out with murderers--even though he is apparently against them!? His entire character made no sense. They never explained why he was a Brit living in the middle of nowhere (it was impossible to hide his accent), why he bothered to come along with the hired army IF he was so against their wicked plan nor why he would risk his life for a cause he didn't believe in at all. As for Kristofferson, his excellent acting and better defined character made his character more believable, though having him move to Wyoming AND risk his life for a prostitute made no sense at all.<br /><br />This brings up the worst aspect of HEAVEN'S GATE. While the scenes are WAY TOO LONG and needed trimming, the worst part of the film is that the characters were like cardboard. John Hurt (a wonderful actor with nothing to do in the film), Jeff Bridges and many other big names are there but you have no idea why. In fact, other than Kristofferson, Isabelle Huppert (as a hooker with a heart of gold--quite the cliché) and perhaps Christopher Walken, EVERYONE is completely one-dimensional. It's hard to imagine a movie THIS long where you don't know or understand the characters. <br /><br />Much of the film also seems anachronistic. Who would have thought to have a giant roller rink constructed in the middle of no where in 1890? I am sure that just getting the basic supplies in this region in the West would have been very, very difficult--and yet we are expected to believe that trains filled with roller skates and lumber arrived instead of FOOD. Maybe if they hadn't spent a bazillion dollars building and frequenting the roller rink, the farmers could have afforded to BUY food and avoided this war over purloined cattle!!! And what's with the guy on roller skates with the fiddle? What did this have to do with a land war? <br /><br />The most obvious problem you are left with is that it's a film where very, very little actually happens until the big battle late in the film. There are lots of scenes of filth and flat nothingness. So much nothingness that by the time the battle occurs, many audience members would have left or are now so hostile to the film that it's inevitable that nothing could salvage the film.<br /><br />As for the final battle, it was done reasonably well but had problems. First, this minor skirmish on the prairie lasted longer than the D-Day invasion!! Second, while details of the actual events of the so-called ""Johnson County War"" are a tad sketchy, we do know that the characters played by Huppert and Kristofferson never actually were there, as they'd both been hung BEFORE the battle. Third, I can't believe that Cimino actually killed animals throughout the film--especially during the final battle. While I am far from a bleeding heart about animal rights, his need to use animal guts and actually kill some of the horses is a low point in cinematic history. Watching and knowing that some of the horses died to achieve Cimino's ""vision"" for the film is very sad.<br /><br />Finally, after the big battle, we have an epilogue. While it is blessedly short, it also seemed completely unnecessary and vague. We see Kristofferson on a fancy yacht, so we can assume that he's finally putting some of that Harvard education to work for himself. We also see a woman who appears to be one that Kris looked at a couple times during the prologue. Most importantly, nothing is said and you have no idea what the final outcome. I read up on it myself and found that the film often got the facts wrong.<br /><br />Overall, to say the film is long and needed tons more editing was like saying WWII was a ""minor tiff"". Well, I've certainly seen a lot worse, but if you factor in the cost of production, I truly think it might just be one of the worst films in history.<br /><br />Finally, when a film has this much explicit nudity I warn parents. However, as no child COULD sit through this film (even with a promise of sex), the warning is not necessary.",negative

"I really liked this movie.<br /><br />Everyone has something to be blamed for, everyone is real. No paperboard heroes or cold, omnipotent, know-all characters.<br /><br />I read many others viewers here complaining about Anne morality and about James will to maintain his love for her, despite her cheating on him, but I don't agree.<br /><br />I found Anne (Emily Watson) absolutely wonderful and I felt love for her.<br /><br />She was a heavily repressed woman, her actions were not planned: once she started to break free she was in confusion and did many errors. But so it's in real life, when you gain freedom you are likely to do errors (expecially at the start point).<br /><br />Was she a little too ungrateful? Maybe. But we must remember that she is running with her feet for the first time. She knows that James after all is a good man, maybe a little too stiff, serious and work centered; but she also feels the urge to live the life as herself.<br /><br />Is she to blame more than him? I think no.<br /><br />But the turn happening into their lives generates some changes.<br /><br />James instead of letting his wife go out of his life (as other viewers suggested as the right choice) bites the bullet and waits, hoping for the better. He starts to understand that what he superficially though was OK (his marriage) in reality was a control game played by him on his wife.<br /><br />This is not a story with characters having over-emotional and precarious nature (i.e. the usual clichè Latin American or Italian jealous guys), this is a story of men and women that use both heart and brain.<br /><br />It can be very painful but if you really love a person (women or man) and if you are not a terribly unstable nature, you are likely to forgive his/her cheating and let him/her go. Unless you are a jealous, prehistoric, crime-of-passion inclined, possessive and mentally instable individual.<br /><br />A really good movie. The last scene, when James - despite all the things happened before - goes with Anne to the train station is really moving: She is free and He understood what freedom means for a person.<br /><br />Guido",positive

"You can't hold too much against this knowing that it was made in four days, and I had expected it to be campy anyway. (It's not all that campy in reality. With the exception of Kevin Kalisher and Huntley Ritter, who don't take themselves seriously, the rest of the cast plays it halfway straight; Riley Smith is exceptionally bad.) The ridiculous story is actually paid attention to, which kind of shocked me; I assumed the whole purpose with these ultra-low-budget horror movies was to cater to the basest sexual fantasies and not give a damn about the story, but they use lots of words like ""technological"" and ""physicality"" in the script to get their point across. (Although it's possible that the story is important only to explain why there's so few cast members.) Nobody cares about this stupid storyline, and the only things that are interesting in the film are the mocking of cults and the soft-core homoeroticisms (which aren't all that edgy). I would have enjoyed it more if there were just some random killings for no reason. The film is grainy, with a TV-quality look and acting level. There are a few ""sexy"" scenes that are alright -- the boys writhing in bed in their boxers, feeling themselves up; or being tied down and making orgasmic faces while wine is poured on them -- and some of them are kinda funny.

I have never seen a gore-movie with superb acting, but hey, who's surprised? The acting in Live Feed was... well, not there! I've seen some commented this as it must have been a school project or something. Okey, but not by students in media or acting school. This was NO class at all! And what about the story? A really sad rip-off on Hostel. And what about the gore? What about the psychopathic torture scenes that supposed to make your guts twist and leave you cold-sweating? That was the most disappointing about the hole movie! Short, quick and NO edge. More like an execution rather than a torture. Okey, there where buckets of blood, but it didn't even look real. The slaughtering and the violence reminded more of Braindead than Hostel or any of the Saw-movies. And Braindead was fun! Okey, I laughed at Live Feed a couple of times, but that was more out of disappointment than out of sheer fun!<br /><br />So instead of wasting 80 minutes by watching Live Feed, watch ANYTHING else!",negative

"Captain Marvel was a last minute shoe-in to the marvel universe.  Each character was more forgettable than the last with none given the opportunity to prove their significance to the story. Cheated out of two films, Captain Marvel felt like more of a justifucation for her being in the much anticipated Endgame rather than an exploration into the depths of the character. The film however did a good job of showcasing just how powerful she can be but ultimately dropped the ball in developing a character we care to see have such power.",negative
"I want to preface this review by saying I did enjoy The Force Awakens and despite that films flaws I was excited to see how the new trilogy developed. Unfortunately after seeing The Last Jedi I have nowhere near as much enthusiam for seeing the next film. If I could describe The Last Jedi in one word it would be ""Dissapointing"". I feel like this film could of been so much more but ultimately fell flat in meeting my expectations. While there were some fun and visually appealing scenes throughout the movie they didn't make up for rest of the films weaknesses. I guess I could say this film lacked the spirit and fun the other films had ( Yes even the prequels ). It almost didn't feel like a Star Wars film at times but something else entirely different. It seems like the writers for this film couldn't decide what they wanted this film to be and after running out of time put out this jumbled mess. Ramblings aside, I can only hope the next film is able to redeem the franchise and if not I won't be tuning in for anymore Star Wars films",negative

"This movie is bufoonery! and I loved it! The ""dragon lord"" (Jacky Chan) and his buddy, ""cowboy"", totally made the movie fun, meaningful, and just plain silly. The movie is a rare blend of a good vs. evil fight and (somehow) the wonders and fun that is growing up. Long Shao Ye takes the viewer through the daily activities of the young ""dragon lord"" (so named because he is the son of a wealthy family) and ""cowboy"", which include implementing clever, elaborate ways to escape studying (with the help of the entire household, including the tutor), competing in rather boyish (and idiotically interesting) ways to gain the affection of a local girl, competing in ""soccer"" (you will see what i mean) and the list goes on. Somehow they find themselves in the midst of a fight to save the a shipment of valuable antiques and the lives of several people.<br /><br />The movie has its serious moments. But they do not depress, but rather inspire. The playfulness of the boys are not lost in this exchange, but is actually employed against evil. What I really loved about this movie is how it ends. Not the typical confrontation (which in itself was awesome), but well, you'll see. Let me just say it truly captures the spirit of the movie.<br /><br />silly, witty, meaningful, and nostalgic. great movie.",positive

"When you first sit down to watch this movie, keep in mind that you are about to see something you've probably never seen before. Keep in mind that this is a movie where they obviously spent INSANE amounts of cash on explosions and not enough on acting or anything else for that matter. The crazy thing I noticed is that every character is completely over-portrayed, and it seems (most of the time anyhow) that the film had been 'sped-up' to make the characters move faster! (I wonder if the Hong Kong version was dubbed too?) I understand the cartoon had this, but it doesn't work for live-action. It just looks odd... as if the camera crew decided to act because they couldn't afford real actors.<br /><br />The English version is horribly dubbed, and the character's words do not match the mouths at all. I would have preffered subtitles, but since this is a kids movie, and since some kids cannot read well, I'll let it go. But there is something extremely odd about this movie. It's supposedly a kids movie, but there's a lot of material about SEX, RAPE, and STRIPPING which isn't exactly for young Western audiences. (In the Orient, they have different laws and sexuality in children's movies is much more accepted). But parents be warned! There is a scene where two characters talk about rape, multiple scenes where people say 'sex maniac' and a scene where this insanely young japanese girl does a sexy dance for one of the 'sex maniacs' and shows him her breasts! Who was this movie made for anyway?<br /><br />Oh, and the special effects are laughable. You can tell the spaceship-like things that bomb the village are cardboard cutouts (or animation, I wasn't sure) that look unconvincing, even to a kid. The makers of this movie left out a lot of cool things from the cartoon, simply because they couldn't budget the kind of money they'd need. I didn't like how the names of all the characters were changed... it made me wonder if this movie was made by the same people as Dragon Ball Z.<br /><br />I don't really recommed this movie to anyone. Kids, adults, or Dragon Ball Z fans. It's just a poor representation of the cartoon, and obviously, one will be able to tell that this movie was rushed and no care whatsoever was put into it. I won't even get into the camerawork... just wait until the end credits at the still picture that sits there for 2 minutes... most of the shots are not framed correctly AT ALL and the movie just seems made by amateurs. Grainy film quality too.<br /><br />Just all around horrible!!!!<br /><br />",negative

"Having seen the movie I can honestly say that the debate over her and the movie was blown out of proportion, it is a good movie to watch, being neither the best or worse of the MCU. I did have small issues with the film (spoilers to follow) since when have the Scrulls be a sympathetic race? Casting them as refugees seems wrong on many levels, I can understand the battle between good and evil as a fundamental part of a movie, but to make the Kree into the monsters seems over the top. Best bet would have been to make both races  despicable and have Mar-vel tired of the Atrocities committed by both sides to catch the innocent in the middle. I thought making Mar-bel into a woman was the wrong choice but will let it slide because it would not have fit the movies narrative to have Carol to look up to a male role model. All in all it is worth the price of admission and a popcorn.",positive

"Over-powered mobile suits that can annihilate entire armies - Check! Weapons that hardly need to be aimed and still annihilate everything - Check! Mobile suits based on angels - Check!<br /><br />OK - its a Gundam series. This one, Gundam Wing, has good character development, real-world complexity, interesting ideas and some pretty eye-candy.<br /><br />With characters, the initially weak Relena Dorlan (later Peacecraft, then back to Dorlan) gets stronger and more independent (although is still absolutely besotted with Heero Yuy, the series main character). The aforementioned Heero, initially a cold, hard butcherer, becomes more and more human, while still remaining in-character. And seeing the lost Millardo Peacecraft (whos nomm de guerre is Zechs Marquise) float between OZ, freelance, and command of White Fang shows how some people can really lose themselves in their own creations.<br /><br />The complexity of the political and military situation is also quite good - reflecting how the real world works. However, in 49 half-hour episodes, it does become a bit of a liability in that this complexity isn't used to its full potential.<br /><br />The ideas at the core of the series - the necessity of fighting, the desire for peace, etc - are ones that resonate even today. In retrospect, the series was ahead of its time, what with the ""War on Terrorism"" and all. But its exploration of these ideas, the monologues, especially those of Treize Kushrenada, is an incredible dramatic piece, forming some of the best writing in the series.<br /><br />But that sometimes good writing is also sometimes extremely poor, which dramatically causes it to lose some of its edge.<br /><br />In terms of eye-candy, which is what this one has in bucketloads, everything from the mobile suits to the battleship Libra (No not the tampons you idiot!) is wells designed, and explodes in big balls of orange (which is bad, because better animation would've had better explosions). But who cares?! Stuff explodes, and thats all that matters.<br /><br />In short though, the sheer complexity of the series means that if you miss out on a few episodes, you've missed out on a lot. The poor writing can leave you cringing, and sometimes the animation makes you go ""WTF?!?!"" But this is made up for in its classic animation style, its scale, sparks of incredible dialogue, and its more mature exploration that one expects of such Japenese animations.",positive
"I can't quite say that ""Jerry Springer:Ringmaster"" is the worst film I have ever seen. The film would be better off if it were, because at least the worst film I've ever seen, (Prom Night II) interested me enough for me to hate it. My only reaction after leaving the theatre happened when I looked up at the clock and discovered that only 90 minutes had passed. It had seemed much more like years. It is an endless repetition of poor people, (or what Jerry Springer seems to believe poor people are), screwing each other, hitting each other, insulting each other, and then repeating the process with the same attention to duty the rest of us use when shampooing. The plot, which covers how a group of stupid people mangle their lives badly enough to provide grist for the Jerry Springer mill, advances solely because of the idiocy of the characters. This makes it impossible to care what happens to them. It never mattered to me whether they got on the show, or what they said, or who slept with whom. Maybe I'm not supposed to care about them. Maybe I'm supposed to look at them as some kind of comic type-- to see their outrageous behavior as inherently funny. Too bad it isn't. The humor is not outrageous. It's innocuous. It's predictable. Humor has to have something behind it, some kind of painful irony or life experience, in order to function. Scatology is not wit. An example. A mother catches her daughter and her husband in bed. To take revenge she marches across the trailer park and gives oral sex to her daughter's boyfriend. Since I was over the shock of Jerry Springer's show a long time ago, I had the same reaction I had to Andrew Dice Clay's obscene nursery rhymes; not laughter, just yawning. Lastly, I found Springer's pose as a populist tiresome and unconvincing. If he really were an advocate of the poor, he would bring on a single mom from Bed-Sty to talk about trying to raise her kids in New York City on $12,000 a year. Or, failing that, he would at least give the participants of his shows a cut of his profits. Jerry Springer gets millions for his shows, his movie, his book and videos. His guests just get round trip air fare, hotel accommodations, and a chance to humiliate themselves. If he liked poor people so much, he'd give them at least some of the money they earn for him. It appears that Springer wanted to make this movie to grab some legitimacy for himself. Jeez, with all his fine work, you'd think he'd have earned our respect already. Anyway, the film is weak and boring. It doesn't even succeed at being offensive. If you want to have a better evening, videotape a bug zapper for a night and then watch that.",negative

"Let me begin. The disappointment of this movie begins with Jude Law manipulating her to control her emotions in order to prevent her from seeking the truth about her visions. I believe it was several times where the point was made to suppress her emotions. Apart from one tear and one watery eyed moment, (I'll get to the part where she breaks out of her restraints at the end) I saw ZERO emotion come from this grown woman. nNext, in the process of escaping the skrulls' ship she creates an immense hole that started a vacuum effect. She miraculously pulls herself back into the ship and walks effortlessly out the area and around the corner even though ever other being and object in that room went flying out. Ok, ok, so you'll argue, she IS Captain Marvel, and to that I say, remember her escape pod also got damaged? No, Captain Marvel protection power there, the girl was holding on for dear life. nBy the way, the movie is saturated with scenes of her as a young girl being taunted and yelled at by every male throughout her life. Seriously, she has no other memorable moment in life, other than the less than genuine friendship she has with her fellow pilot and her mentor. Can I just add that Mar-Vel was originally a man who she fell in love with and tried to rescue her after she was kidnapped. A good male relationship in her life??? Nah, let's just make everyone she loves female down to her 'friend's' child. (Dear Disney, some of us love our husbands, dads, and brothers). Oh and by the way, would you leave your family and adopt another one just because your dad yelled at you for doing something stupid like crashing a go-cart that would have resulted in a major permanent injury?!?!? I'm of Spanish descent, yelling would be the least of my worries. Ha!nLet me go back to the friend she had. I have a better relationship with the cashiers at my grocery store. It looked like an amateur and less than talented drama club played those scenes out. ""Act like the two of you are friends."" ACTION! :-/.nOne thing the friend revealed was ONE big CHARACTER FLAW of Captain Marvel. Her friend revealed that she cheated on a race, to that she responded, 'What's wrong with taking a shortcut?' Her friend responded by saying the shortcut was against the rules, and our hero just smirks. That makes sense, in the beginning when Jude Law was doing hand to hand combat with her and she started feeling like she was losing, she immediately cheated by using her powers. Anything to get ahead huh, forget the rules as long as you come out on top? I wouldn't teach my dog to be like you. (by the way in reality she was a NASA genius and worked for the CIA...not this garbage)nThe movie is just repetitious to say the least, but now that I mentioned pets, I believe the cat was sent to save the movie, it took up several humorous scenes that I'm sure would have been otherwise taken up by another flashback of a crying little girl. The relationship between Samuel L Jackson and the cat saved the two hours of torture from Larson's dry and unimpressionable personality.nThe ending topped this off with a putrid stench that I pray to soon forget. Why?! All I could ask myself is 'why would a hero destroy missiles and further more, destroy one ship of the beings who caused so much death and destruction to just let them go in the end?' She went through that ship like a knife through butter and Lee Pace looks at her, makes a declaration to capture her, and then leaves with no objection from her! She floats there so they could bask in all her glory then let's them get away?? To what end? You think they will have turned over a new leaf? Of course no! She tells Jude Law to send them a message that shes coming after them....uh wow, they were right in front of you why did you need a messenger?? Jude was on a wrecked ship, and yet she rushed back to finish him off and let the greater evil escape. nFinally, skrulls being compared to immigrants... subtle :-/ (in reality the skrulls aren't exactly good). I come to the movies for a break from all this. You want to get into politics, run for office otherwise it's just propaganda. nFinal note, I'm so ready for someone to make fun of the scenes where she's standing up throughout her life before she breaks through the restraints. Here are some ideas, standing up out of a chair, standing up after tying your shoe, standing up after picking up a pencil, stand up after slipping on a banana peel, etc.",controversial

"Star Wars: The Last Jedi' throws so much at you than any other ""Star Wars"" movie, that you walk out feeling both confused and exhausted... but, it isn't short of its fair share of thrills. The movie pretty much begins where 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' (2015) left off, Rey (Daisy Ridley) has finally found Luke Skywalker (a powerhouse Mark Hamill), and is ready to take her training. Gone are the days of her being a desert scavenger on the planet Jakku, and she has become what she never thought she could be. The Resistance is back with Leia (the late Carrie Fisher), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega), as they try to escape the First Order after the destruction of Starkiller Base, and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is not wasting any time as he is being constantly tested by Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). Now, I already know that just by explaining the plot, it already sounds similar to 'Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back' (1980), but no... it isn't. There are similarities for sure, and similarities to another ""Star Wars"" film which I won't mention, but you'll know when you see it. Director Rian Johnson ('Brick' and 'Looper') was adamant about how this is a more ""different"" Star Wars movie, and he is right. Aesthetically, this is one of the most stunning ""Star Wars"" movies I've seen, there is a lot of uses of the color red here. Not to mention that Johnson does break some rules (if I can say that) regarding the ""Star Wars"" lore and mythology, but at the same time, he also shows us how powerful something like the Force can be, and we may not have realized that. There is one scene however, which turns away from all that. Without spoiling too much, let's just say that there is a small plot where two characters have to travel to a particular planet to find something, and while on that planet, it feels like a completely different movie (maybe this was Rian Johnson's intention). The scene does go on for a bit too long, and ultimately, I could do without it. For 2 hours and 32 minutes, cutting out that scene would shave at least 20 minutes. The main reason why I would prefer ""The Force Awakens"" more is because that movie's plot was minimal and simplistic, despite it being infamously similar to 1977's ""A New Hope"". But it had great character development, and fast-paced action, and the story never lost focus. Here, just with that one scene, it did lose just a touch of focus, but Rian Johnson isn't afraid to throw so much at you. This movie tells a brilliant story regarding where our main characters go, and what fate lies ahead of them. There are also so many plot-twists in this movie, breaking the narrative code and taking as many risks as possible, this might just be the most complex entry in this iconic franchise. Obviously, I really enjoyed this movie, and cannot wait to see it some more. It is a fantastic follow-up to a very entertaining ""The Force Awakens"", and is sure to open more doors for the upcoming ""Episode IX"", Rian Johnson clearly has a unique vision for this franchise and its characters that no other director - not even George Lucas or J.J. Abrams - would dare to take. Johnson took some risks, and for the most part, it paid off, which makes his upcoming ""Star Wars"" trilogy all the more anticipated. ",positive
"A sharp political comment posturing as a coming of age story is what this movie is. The annoying thing is that it works effectively on both levels. It isn't supposed to but it does. This tale of four boys and a girl growing up in 1953 Communist Belgrade is a heart warmer. It is what gentlemen refer to as classic cinema. Obviously, 1953 Belgrade is not as harsh a dictatorial and fascist environment as the Communist society is often portrayed. One can listen to rock and roll music, one of the songs played is the song ""Hey Babu Riba"" ala the title of the movie. But jeans cannot be bought nor certain drugs which are illegal to possess. Unlike a heavy-handed criticism of a communist society this movie does it by showing how it affects the lives of the five protagonists who refer to themselves as we four. The girl who has a father in exile in Italy and is awaiting a passport for her mother and she to travel out to join him, the piano that is taken away from communion use from one of the boys, the sudden giving of your home and quarters to your new comrades because they need it. The boys spend a lot of time listening to music and it is made clear they despise the fascism that communism has created as they engage in tiffs with a fascist charlatan who has Stalin tattooed on his hands. These all leads to the actions they take later on and the remembrance of a time fading away, as this movie was released in 1986 in the twilight of the Soviet Empire. A great movie worth seeing again and again. ""Repentance is not your enemy but yet it is also nobody's friend.""",positive

".I loved it, I'm not a fan of the MCU especially because I don't like the absurd humor and overacting of most of the Marvel movies, so I went to see Captain Marvel with low expectations waiting for the typical origin of superhero and I was surprised, the actress does the best work I've seen in this type of movies, she is natural, relatable and has a lot of chemistry with the rest of the characters. The only 'but' is: the story is fast and doesn't give you time to assimilate it, besides that I think some parts need more development time, it still works thanks to the chemistry of the characters. The Captain Marvel's origin story is so different from the typical structure (get the powers - learn to control them - something emotional happens - unleashes the full potential of the powers) that has been new and fascinating in addition to the mix between a start with science fiction environment and for later the 90' atmospherenIn short, it left me with many unknowns and intrigues that will certainly force me to go back to the theaters to see Avengers Endgame just to know more about this character.

"""RVAM""'s reputation preceded it. I first heard of it in one of those Medved style movie books, ""The 50 Worst Movies Ever"" or ""The Golden Turkey Awards"", or something like that. Every review of the film basically said that this movie was so bad that it would make you bleed from the eyes to watch it. So when the Exposed Film Society finally got around to showing it, I was anticipating the kind of cathartic experience that only a true cinematic stinker can provide. <br /><br />However, ""Robot"" wasn't really all that bad. <br /><br />Oh, this is definitely a ""Z"" film through and through. Some of the voice dubbing (as is usually the case for K. Gordon Murray imports) is awfully cheesy, and the movie itself seems to be structurally something of a Frankenstein, since a huge chunk of it seems to be footage from a previous ""Aztec Mummy"" movie, narrated with a voice-over by the leading man. A dead giveaway: anytime the question ""Then what happened?"" is asked more than twice in the dialog, you are looking at reassembled footage put together with little regard for plot coherence or momentum. In RVAM, ""Then what happened?"" or ""What happened then?"" is uttered at least four times in the 1st hour. <br /><br />Even without the structural problems, the plot and dialog don't translate well to an older American audience. For instance, as the hero explains (and explains and explains) the back-story. he includes a remark about Doctor Krupp, ""a doctor who suddenly turned into an evil master criminal"" and began his quest for the treasure that the Aztec mummy guards. No background, no explanation, he just ""suddenly turned evil"". Obviously, this was aimed at a pretty undiscriminating audience. <br /><br />The clincher, though, is the ""Robot"", the supposed ""showcase"" of this movie. This Robot is the worst robot special effect since ""Undersea Kingdom"" or even ""Santa Claus Vs. The Martians"". Compared to this hunk of junk, the Tin Man from the ""Wizard Of Oz"" looked like the Terminator chassis that chased Linda Connor through the foundry in T2. The Aztec Mummy himself is well designed and executed; he's recognizably undead, familiar enough to look like a mummy, and yet distinct from the ""Boris Karloff"" bandage collection familiar to most American audiences. But whoever designed the Robot in this followup had no feel for the concept...or no budget. They could at least have given him some knees, for heaven's sake. <br /><br />In addition, the titular battle is terribly executed and lasts less than 60 seconds. (I've seen shoving matches on junior high playgrounds that are more convincing.) Then the movie basically just stops. That seems a bit of a rip off considering the amount of time the movie spends building up to the battle itself.<br /><br />In spite of all these problems, the movie isn't horrible or incompetent the way a Coleman Francis film or a Larry Buchanan film was. Compared to ""Monster A-Go-Go"" or ""Attack of The Eye Creatures"", ""RVTAM"" is like a Coppola film. It's just kind of dull and boring and silly. The actors are competent (in a mannered B movie way) and reasonably photogenic; Dr. Krupp, in particular seems to be having a wonderful time as he leers and plots and capers about in his cape and ""Phantom Of the Opera"" suit. I often found myself rooting for him, in spite of his being the villain. <br /><br />Anyway, I've seen much, much worse. File this with ""Samson Vs The Vampire Women"", under ""interesting Mexican juvenile oddities"".",negative
"Until today, I thought there only three people, including me, who considered Heaven's Gate (1980)to be a masterpiece and perhaps the last great western, (since the 1970), after, Little Big Man (1970), Jeremiah Johnson (1972), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) and The Long Riders (1980).<br /><br /> I was stunned and pleased to see that 22.5% of those voting at IMDB rate this movie a 10, as do I. A recent book, the Worst Movies of All Time, includes Heaven's Gate. Through it's production and release it was vilified, as no movie since Cleopatra, almost twenty years before. At one time it was considered the most expensive over-budget movie of all time, surpassing even Cleopatra. It was blamed for the downfall of its studio, United Artists, until everyone finally saw all the studios were falling. Michael Cimino, fresh from his glory with the Deer Hunter was hated and despised for his success and movie making excess, but clearly, that was petty jealousy at its worst.<br /><br /> Cimino ended up fashioning one of the great expositions of the American experience. This film is not to be missed but any serious student of American filmmaking.",positive
"I saw this last night, very excited about this character coming to big screen, and usually Marvel does great job. But was  very disappointed. The storyline was very confusing and all over the place, there wasn't a strong antagonist, and Bries Captain Marvel was rather bland. Strange plot twist of Skrulls who have been trying to take over Earth turn out to be the good guys? The Skrulls look & makeup were extremely Star Trek been-there-seen-that ordinary. Could have been much more flushed out, more depth, and unique. Annette Bennings character was conceptually interesting but executed very poorly. Jude Laws character was really a waste. The cat was ok but just all of the sudden was hers, even though she crashed landed on Earth? Samuel Jackson was actually fantastic here. But overall the movie is not unique, not as powerful as could be, and really quite pedestrian.",negative
"The Last Jedi is a amazing film, but it does suffer from some pacing issues. This film is amazing, there is no doubt about that, the action sequences are fantastic, the character development is better than in any other Star Wars film and the Actors, both new and old, are performing to the best of their abilities. Although the themes in this film are maybe a little darker than The Force Awakens, it still manages to combine comedy elements with more meaningful moments, something Star Wars has always been able to do. The only issue I had with the film was its pacing, I guess when you start off in the way this film does you have to expect the it to slow down, but I feel like The Last Jedi took a little too much time before we were treated to some more of the amazing action sequences that the film does so well. Overall this film is a fantastic addition to the Star Wars universe, picking up where The Force Awakens left off and leaving the trilogy perfectly poised for Episode IX.",positive

Entertaining, interesting, actors did a fine job with some standouts, some great moments, no overbearing nostalgia trips or political messages (small political notes, but not at the forefront)  - overall a strong recommendation. The largest weakness was that it moved a bit too quickly in order to get to certain points. Understandably so, but still took away from our ability to invest in some of the characters. There was enough there to make it so you wanted the characters to see things through, but in simple terms, I did not cheer as much as I feel I could have at certain moments. Does not detract from the performances, action, or decent writing. And of course, as I think both parties seem to agree, that mid-credits sequence.....",controversial

The movie starts out like it could become interesting and ends with a poorly executed, disappointingly boring, twist. Watching the first 10 minutes and last 5 minutes of the movie would have made this movie OK but everything in between makes this an absolutely boring movie to watch.

"This film is so 1980's and that is what I like so much about it. It does an excellent job of conveying the feel of that odd decade. The reality that Russian nukes could wipe you out at any time. Reagan in the White House telling everybody that things were great, while more and more social programs were slashed. Young people dropped out, but not as far as their parents of the 1960's did. Young people still went to school, they just smoked so much dope that their sensetivities were all but dead. Nothing effected them, not even the death of one of their classmates at the hands of one of their friends. How weird is it to realize that the murder was wrong, but you are not sure why. Watching the characters deal with the crime is fascinating and telling of a very sick society. Glover is great, Keanu is great, Hopper is incredible.

"This movie made me think....of how I could write something about it without personally dissing the director and all the actors, who, as an Australian, I am proud of for actually getting out there and making a film.<br /><br />But the movie itself? Let me tell you a story....<br /><br />Found this DVD in my local rental shop yesterday and had vague recollections of the reviews at the time of cinema release here, so I thought I would give it a go.<br /><br />For some reason, I decided to watch the 'special features' before I watched the actual movie, not something that I usually do. Turned the 'making of' off halfway through, as I'd had enough cringing at the 'aren't we so wonderful for putting together such a hard hitting film with such a raw script' attitude.<br /><br />The movie? Ugh. Full of clichés and pathetic character development. The actors? Well done guys, you are Aussies and I applaud you. And, just like a footy team is only as good as the coach that directs them, you unfortunately did NOT have a great script to work with.<br /><br />I felt that the movie actually trivialised so many of the subjects that it seemed to want to cover. I have seen many reviews here that refer to it as nothing more than a soap. Agreed.<br /><br />Finally (and forgive me if I don't phrase this correctly), I was extremely disappointed that there were no optimistic overtones at all. Yes, we all know that life is full of hard stuff, and yes we know that things such as incest DO occur, but I really find it hard to applaud a movie that has not one piece of joy in it. I believe that a director has a responsibility to put it in there SOMEWHERE. Otherwise, the movie is all about THEM and THEIR feelings, they have created it for themselves, not for an audience.<br /><br />Which I think is the basis of why this movie isn't so great. The special features mention that the director wrote the screenplay in a 36 hour sitting, the day after he himself tried to end his own life. Well, it may have been cathartic for him to do this, however the movie reeks of self-indulgence when you know the story behind why it was written. ""I feel horrid, I'm going to write a movie about feeling horrid"". (Note: I have read the interview with Andrew Urban, and understand WHY Thalluri needed to write something to help him through his own issues, but I believe there is a line in film that cannot be crossed - the line of making a movie purely for your own emotional needs, and I feel that this is what has unintentionally happened here)<br /><br />By his own admission, the director had no technical experience at all, and sadly, this makes the movie come off looking like nothing more than a year twelve media project.<br /><br />As for any recommendations that this movie should be studied at school, or that all teenagers should watch it - not sure there either. Because there is a VERY dangerous line at the end. I too have been in a place where I have thought that someone who no longer has to 'face life' is 'lucky', but as an adult, I do worry that this line could be influential on a young viewer that was in a vulnerable frame of mind. Might be in there to promote discussion, but again, it reflects no possibility of redemption or joy in this story as a whole. In fact, it almost indicates that there is more sadness to come.<br /><br />I haven't seen Elephant, but I just might go find it, given all the comparisons here.<br /><br />Nothing personal here guys, I do hope you can make another movie someday, and we all have to start out somewhere, so forgive me if I've been too harsh. I am glad that you are proud of what you created, which in the end is what life is all about. It's not a movie I would recommend though.<br /><br />Oh, I DID like the way the time-frames often collided, thought that was an interesting way to film. <br /><br />But the whole ""Its the quiet ones you have to watch"" - we already know that.",negative

"Oh Dear Lord, How on Earth was any part of this film ever approved by anyone? It reeks of cheese from start to finish, but it's not even good cheese. It's the scummiest, moldiest, most tasteless cheese there is, and I cannot believe there is anyone out there who actually, truly enjoyed it. Yes, if you saw it with a load of drunk/stoned buddies then some bits might be funny in a sad kind of way, but for the rest of the audience the only entertaining parts are when said group of buddies are throwing popcorn and abusive insults at each other and the screen. I watched it with an up-for-a-few-laughs guy, having had a few beers in preparation to chuckle away at the film's expected crapness. We got the crapness (plenty of it), but not the chuckles. It doesn't even qualify as a so-bad-it's-good movie. It's just plain bad. Very, very bad. Here's why (look away if you're spoilerphobic): The movie starts out with a guy beating another guy to death. OK, I was a few minutes late in so not sure why this was, but I think I grasped the 'this guy is a bit of a badass who you don't want to mess with' message behind the ingenious scene. Oh, and a guy witnesses it. So, we already have our ultra-evil bad guy, and wussy but cute (apparently) good guy. Cue Hero. Big Sam steps on the scene in the usual fashion, saving good guy in the usual inane way that only poor action films can accomplish, i.e. Hero is immune to bullets, everyone else falls over rather clumsily. Cue first plot hole. How the bloody hell did Sammy know where this guy was, or that he'd watched the murder. Perhaps this, and the answers to all my plot-hole related questions, was explained in the 2 minutes before I got into the cinema, but I doubt it. In fact, I'm going to stop poking holes in the plot right here, lest I turn the movie into something resembling swiss cheese (which we all know is good cheese). So, the 'plot' (a very generous word to use). Good guy must get to LA, evil guy would rather he didn't, Hero Sam stands between the two. Cue scenery for the next vomit-inducing hour - the passenger plane. As I said, no more poking at plot holes, I'll just leave it there. Passenger plane. Next, the vital ingredient up until now missing from this gem of a movie, and what makes it everything it is - Snakes. Yay! Oh, pause. First we have the introduction to all the obligatory characters that a lame movie must have. Hot, horny couple (see if you can guess how they die), dead-before-any-snakes-even-appear British guy (those pesky Brits, eh?), cute kids, and Jo Brand. For all you Americans that's an English comic famous for her size and unattractiveness. Now that we've met the cast, let's watch all of them die (except of course the cute kids). Don't expect anything original, it's just snake bites on various and ever-increasingly hilarious (really not) parts of the body. Use your imagination, since the film-makers obviously didn't use theirs.<br /><br />So, that's most of the film wrapped up, so now for the best bit, the ending. As expected, everything is just so happy as the plane lands that everyone in sight starts sucking face. Yep, Ice-cool Sammy included. But wait, we're not all off the plane yet! The last guy to get off is good guy, but just as he does he gets bitten by a (you guessed it) snake (of all things). Clearly this one had been hiding in Mr. Jackson's hair the whole time, since it somehow managed to resist the air pressure trick that the good old hero had employed a few minutes earlier, despite the 200ft constrictor (the one that ate that pesky British bugger) being unable to. So, Sam shoots him and the snake in one fell swoop. At this point I prayed that the movie was about to make a much-needed U-turn and reveal that all along the hero was actually a traitor of some sort. But no. In a kind of icing on the cake way (but with stale cheese, remember), it is revealed that the climax of the film was involving a bullet proof vest. How anyone can think that an audience 10 years ago, let alone in 2006 would be impressed by their ingenuity is beyond me, but it did well in summing up the film.<br /><br />Actually, we're not quite done yet. After everyone has sucked face (Uncle Sam with leading actress, good guy with Tiffany, token Black guy with token White girl, and the hot couple in a heart warming bout of necrophilia), it's time for good guy and hero to get it on....In Bali!!! Nope, it wasn't at all exciting, the exclamation marks were just there to represent my utter joy at seeing the credits roll. Yes, the final shot of the film is a celebratory surfing trip to convey the message that a bit of male bonding has occurred, and a chance for any morons that actually enjoyed the movie to whoop a few times. That's it. This is the first time I've ever posted a movie review, but I felt so strongly that somebody must speak out against this scourge of cinematography. If you like planes, snakes, Samuel L.Jackson, air hostesses, bad guys, surfing, dogs in bags or English people, then please, please don't see this movie. It will pollute your opinion of all of the above so far that you'll never want to come into contact with any of them ever again. Go see United 93 instead. THAT was good.",negative

"This is another case of Hollywood Arrogance presuming to eclipse French Style. The original, Mon Pere ce heros, was one of the most charming films of 1991 so naturally the accountants in Hollywood thought they could hire Depardieu and phone the rest in. They did, however, take the precaution of hiring Francis Veber to write an English version albeit one utilising virtually every word of the original. Depardieu brings his Gallic charm and Katherine Heigl shows all the promise that is now paying off. The thing is that when the French make a sort of Lolita-lite they get away with it because the 'dirty French postcard' thinking works in their favour; here the Hollywood idea of lightweight subtlety is to have Depardieu (totally unaware that his daughter has let it be known he is actually her lover), prevailed upon to play and song 'something French', launch into a spirited version of Thank Heaven For Little Girls.

Just went and saw captain marvel last night and I was really hoping this movie was going to be good. In truth it was pretty bad compared to all the MCU movies that came before. It felt the hero never really had any stuggles to overcome and she was always just super powerful and nothing can stop her. In every MCU stand alone movie there is a moment when the hero overcomes a specific struggle and defeats the bad guy this movie has none of that. She just beats everyone way to easily. Then the scrolls are actually the good guys like what?? This movie also throws is alot of politics into the movie you pick up on it when people say certian lines. Im just really worried that once endgame comes there just going to have her show up and destroy thanos. Like I want her to be able to defeat the big bad one day but thanos should be defeated by one of the heroes we as an audience have been growing up with for over - years now. Let her defeat the next big bad. I think this movie would of been way more successful if they would have waited until after endgame to introduce her cause then she is the new face and can help lead the new avengers not try to shoe horn in and take over after - years of movies with the characters we have.

"By 1950, John Ford had already fully-developed the ideas and motifs that would form the core of his most successful Westerns. Always present, for example, is a strong sense of community, most poignantly captured in the Joad family of Steinbeck's 'The Grapes of Wrath (1940).' Within these communities, even amid Ford's loftier themes of racism and the pioneer spirit, there's always room for the smaller human interactions, the minor friendships and romances that make life worth living. 'Wagon Master (1950)' came after Ford had released the first two films in his ""cavalry"" trilogy  'Fort Apache (1948)' and 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949)'  and it covers similar territory, only without the military perspective and, more damningly, the strong lead of John Wayne. Ben Johnson and Harry Cary, Jr. are fine actors, but they feel as though they should be playing second-fiddle to somebody, and Ward Bond's cursing Mormon elder, while potentially a candidate for such a role, isn't given quite enough focus to satisfactorily fit the bill.<br /><br />In 'Wagon Master,' Ford seems so comfortable with his tried-and-tested Western formula that any character development is largely glossed over. Ben Johnson's romance with Joanne Dru is treated as an obligation more than anything else, and Harry Cary Jr's charming of a Mormon girl is so perfunctory as to be almost nonexistent in the final film, leaving one to ponder the survival of deleted scenes. Only in Charles Kemper's charismatic and shamelessly-villainous Uncle Shiloh does Ford try some different, and it works, even with his being surrounded by a troop of insufferably hammy slack-jawed yokels. Where Ford does succeed is in orchestrating the conglomeration of three distinct races of Americans  the values-orientated Mormoms, the easygoing horse-traders, the eccentric travelling showmen  into a cohesive community of pioneers looking towards a bright future. This apparent harmony is thrown into disarray by the arrival of Uncle Shiloh's gun-toting outlaws, who exploit the lawlessness of the Western frontier but ultimately lose out to the noble cowboys who ""only ever drew on snakes.""<br /><br />Ford reportedly considered Wagon Master among the favourite of his films, and perhaps this has something to do with the absence of big names like John Wayne or Henry Fonda. Armed only with his stock selection of usual players, Ford is able to generate a sense of community by avoiding placing focus on any one character, though most of the Mormom travellers still remain completely anonymous. Despite being undoubtedly well-made, I can't help feeling that this film only does well what other Ford pictures did even better: the terrific majesty of the the Western frontier was presented more beautifully in 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon'; the romances and friendly squabbles among community members took greater prominence in 'Fort Apache'; the early relations with Native Americans, only hinted at here, were more thoroughly examined in 'The Searchers (1956)'; the bold pioneering spirit of the early settlers was explored more movingly (albeit by Henry Hathaway and George Marshall) in 'How the West Was Won (1962).'

"I am a massive fan of Jet Li! He is THE best HK action film star alive... and consequently - This film rocked! I saw it in the video store and, as it was in the mainstream section of this mainstream video store, I didnt register its presence at first, and had to look twice. I immediately knew what I would be renting out. My only qualm (I suppose I expected it) is that it was dubbed (AAARGh) and not subtitled. Elsewise, the movie's original/strange/cool plot, and full on action made it one of Jet Li's better movies... even though they all fall under that category....",positive
"I finally got a chance to see this movie and I enjoyed it.  The cast was great, and  I liked Nick Fury's interactions with Goose the cat.

"""Der Todesking"" is not exactly the type of film that makes you merry Jörg Buttgereit's second cult monument in a row, which is actually a lot better than the infamous ""Nekromantik"", exists of seven short episodes  one for each day of the week  revolving on unrelated people's suicides. In between these already very disturbing episodes, Buttgereit inserts truly horrifying images of a severely decomposing male corpse. The episodes aren't all equally powerful but, as a wholesome, ""Der Todesking"" is ranked quite high on the list of all-time most depressing art-house films. Particularly the episodes on Wednesday, involving a man explaining his sexual frustrations to a total stranger in the park, and the one of Sunday, focusing on a younger man molesting himself to dead, are extremely intense and devastating to observe. The added value of this film, or any other shockumenary like it, is debatable and I'm not even sure whether or not Buttgereit had any type of message to communicate here. There's the vague mentioning of an eerie chain letter that encourages its readers to commit suicide but mostly we remain uninformed about these people's motivations to end their lives so dramatically. Entirely unlike I expected, ""Der Todesking"" isn't exploitative or repulsively graphic! On the contrary actually, I never could have hoped Buttgereit would be so subtle and thoughtful regarding the portrayal of pure human misery. The Thursday episode is a perfect example of this, as it stylishly shows different viewpoints of a famous German bridge while the names, ages and occupations of persons who jumped off appear on the screen. The production values are inescapably poor and the editing often lacks professionalism, but this isn't what really counts in this type of cinema. The subject matter is strong and forcing us to contemplate about the less cheerful  but also indispensable  aspects of life. GREAT use of tragic music, too!",positive

"It's a crime the first female led MCU movie was so lackluster. The character was bland and not even Samuel L. Jackson could charm his way out of this dumpster fire. The action was decent aside from the few ""shaky cam"" moments but it definitely belongs at the bottom of Marvel's barrel as just okay which knowing their A Game, like Black Panther or Civil War, is insulting that they gave little care for a film that is naturally going to get scrutinized from the beginning.

"The first thing that struck me about this movie was the terrible acting. The whole cast was so uniformly inept at delivering their lines that I started laughing at the awful dialog midway through the film. An even bigger issue with this movie is that at no point do we ever find out what motivates the actions of each character. The one somewhat redeeming aspect of the movie is Halfdan Hussey's innovative visual effects. However, as eye-catching as they may be, they do little to make up for the gaping flaws mentioned above. A dreadful script mixed with community theater level acting does not make for a pleasant viewing. I was honestly shocked at how bad this movie was.",negative

And with that goes the legitimacy of the narrative. Besides that, the time-space continuum in the film is all off, and I'm not necessarily against that in films as a tool, but here it serves only to confuse the viewer into wondering what was said when; thus leading me to the question: is this a documentary or a docudrama?<br /><br />cococravescinema.blogspot.com",negative

The dialog was choppy and bland. It felt like every science fiction trope for the last 30 years was wedged in with little to no originality or thought.n  This was a character I had never heard of but was excited to see because I have always trusted Marvel to understand what we want and give us truly enjoyable movies. I'm going to have to do more research in the future since it seems you can no longer trust Marvel to deliver high quality entertainment, and I'll be doubly mistrusting when they are introducing new and unheard of characters. n  With the price of movie tickets and the variety of good alternative movies to see in the theaters, I strongly recommend that you do not waste your money or time on this film.

"Checked out Captain Marvel this past weekend and really enjoyed Larson's take on the character. Even though the movie does start out a little slow, it picks up about 1/3 of the way through, and we get a good look at how Captain Marvel as a hero is borne from Carol Danvers the woman.nnJackson puts on a solid performance as a young Fury, and it was great to see Agent Coulson back on the big screen. By far my favorite player is Ben Mendelsohn's Talos. Back to Larson Ă˘Â¦ forget the haters, she masterfully plays the part of a combat trained Kree soldier with no memory of her past. Larson's robotic, semi-detached performance as Vers in the first 1/3 of the movie aligns perfectly with someone who only knows what the Kree have trained her to be. Vers gets a much more human touch from Larson as the movie goes along and she reconnects with her past as Carol Danvers as well as how she fits into the events taking place during the movie.nnAnyone who thinks that Captain Marvel, Disney, and Larson are a threat to their manhood aren't real men to begin with. There's no preachy SJW moments, no hidden political agenda, and no room for trolling a decent addition to the MCU. True MCU fans came out in hordes to see this movie, so it's time for the review bombing losers to retreat back to their parent's basement.nnWas the movie perfect? No. Was it a good movie? Yes. Boden and Fleck took some liberties with the origin story, but that's not a deal breaker as it happens in every MCU movie. Way better than Iron Man 3 but not as good as Infinity War, this movie earns it's rightful place in the MCU while setting up nicely for Endgame.nnAfter a slow start, the movie earns 4 stars.",controversial

"Theo Robertson has commented that WAW didn't adequately cover the conditions after WWI which lead to Hitler's rise and WWII.<br /><br />Perhaps he missed the first ONE and a quarter HOURS of volume 8? Covers this period, and together with the earlier volumes in the series, shows clearly the existing conditions, I feel. A friend of mine grew up in Germany during this period, joined the Hitler Youth even, and his experiences were very similar to that mentioned in WAW.<br /><br />This documentary is SO far above the History Channel's documentaries I also own, that there is no comparison.<br /><br />The ONLY fault, and it is a small one, that I have with WAW is this: the numbers are not included, many times. For instance, if you're talking about lend-lease, then how much war material was lent/leased? How much to Russia, how much to Britian? How many merchant ships did the U-Boats sink, and when? How many ships did the German or Japanese Navy have, total, in 1941? What type were they? How many troops? How many troops did the allies have, in total, and by country? Lots of numbers could have made a lot of viewers nod off, but I would have preferred MORE! And naturally, I always want to see more military analysis. Like WHY didn't Patton & Clark trap the German army that was at Cassini, after they had it surrounded, instead of racing Monty to Rome, and letting it escape? I don't think you can begin to understand war until you've seen some of these video segments on ""total war"", like the fire bombing of Dresden. It's like trying to understand Auschwitz, etc., before you see the clips of the death camps: you just can't wrap your head around it - it's too unbelievable.<br /><br />Unknown at that time, and of course, unfilmed, were the most egregious cruelties and inhumanities of the Japanese, including cannibalism, (read ""Flyboys""), and some LIVE vivisection of medical ""experimentation"" prisoners, w/o any anesthetic! <br /><br />Dave",positive

"Greetings again from the darkness. Based on the mega-best seller from author Khaled Hosseini, the film provides us a peak at the ugliness of post-Russia invaded Afghanistan and the terror of the Taliban.

"I must admit, this is one of my favorite horror films of all time. The unique way that John Carpenter has directed this picture, opening the door to so many mock-genres, it will chill you to the bone whether it is your first time watching it or your fiftieth. The sound, the menacing horror of Michael Meyers and the infamous scream of Jamie Lee Curtis gives this film instant cult status and a great start for the independent era. I love the music, I love the characters, the familiar yet spooky setting, the simplistic nature of the villain, and the random chaos of it all. There is no really rhyme or reason to the killing in this first film, giving us a taste of Michael's true nature. Is he insane, or in some way just a very brilliant beast? That question may never be truly answered, but Carpenter gives us his 100% and more devotion to this amazing masterpiece.<br /><br />John Carpenter is the master of horror. While lately his films have not been the caliber that they once were (see Ghosts of Mars), Halloween began his powerhouse of a career. This is his ultimate film. While he did release other greats, I will always remember this one as the film that caused me to turn on all the lights, beware when babysitting, and check behind closed doors, because you never knew where the evil would appear next. Carpenter has this amazing ability to bring you into the world in which he weaves. With the power of his camera, he places these images of Meyers in places you least expected while giving you the perception as if the murderer is right next to you. I loved every scene in which we panned back and there was Michael, watching from the distance, without anyone the wiser. That was scary, yet utterly brilliant. I loved the scenes in which Carpenter pulled your fright from nearly thin air. There you would be, minding your own business, when suddenly that horrid mask would appear out of nowhere. Like the characters, you too thought it was just a trick of the eye, but that is where Carpenter gets you, it isn't. Michael isn't a ghost, he is a human being (or at least we think), yet he has a stronger mental ability than most of the main characters. This leads into some really dark themes and unexplored symbolism, but even without that, this is a spooky film.<br /><br />Then, if you just didn't have enough of Michael just vaporizing in the windows of your house, Carpenter adds that chilling theme music. I still have that tapping of the piano keys in my mind, constantly wondering if Meyers is looking at me through the window. Carpenter has found the perfect combination of visual frights and chilling sounds to foreshadow what may happen to our unsuspecting victims next. It is lethal, and it is done with refreshing originality and more unique thrills than anything released by today's Horror Hollywood could muster. Carpenter's Halloween is a breath of fresh air in the midst of what could be a rough horror year, with actual scares being replaced by Paris Hilton, you know that the quality isn't quite the same.<br /><br />Finally, I would like to say that even the simplistic nature of the opening murder in this film is terrifying and chilling. The use of the ""clown"" mask sent shivers up my spine. The way that it was filmed with that elongated one shot using the child's mask as if it were our own eyes is still one of the best horror openings ever! It completely sets the tone for the remainder of that film. You have the babysitter theme, you have the childish behavior which carries with Michael throughout the film, and you have the art talent of Carpenter all rolled into one. I could literally speak for hours upon hours about this film, but instead I would rather go watch it again. It is worth the repeat visit many times! <br /><br />Overall, I think this is one of the most outstanding films in cinematic history. Skip all those foreign films that think that they are going to chance the face of movies leave it to a budget tight Carpenter and the slasher film genre. This singular movie redefined a whole generation of horror films, and still continues to be an influence on modern-day horror treats. The lethal combination of a genuinely spooky murderer, the powerful cinematography of the events (which normally doesn't amount to much in horror films), and the beauty of Jamie Lee Curtis is exactly what makes Halloween that film above the rest. Sure, Freddy is cool and you feel sympathetic for Jason, but Michael is real, he is troubled, and he is on the loose lusting for the blood of babysitters. What can be better? <br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****",positive

It's a shame that so many people are trying to destroy this movie (many without even seeing it)  because it is a genuinely fun movie from start to finish with great chemistry between all the cast members. I agree that it is a lot of power to drop into the MCU so suddenly and presents a challenge Endgame in giving everyone a fair shake but this does nothing to take away from Captain Marvel itself.

"Wow!  outstanding additional to Marvel universe.  a real treat!.  I wanted to add a bit more to this review, having watched this a second time on dvd originally in the theater.  I am very aware of the critiques of some fans about SJW or identity politics being injected into movies in an over the top kind of way, and that has also been said of this movie.  However, I consider that those elements are very subtle, the story line, arc, and plot of this movie make sense, it is visually appealing, and while the Kree-Skrull war could be utilized much better and expanded on, and I hope it will in the future, this movie still stands as a great visual treat, with a good story line, plot, and a good overall message.  I agree that in some movies today, a political agenda (right or left) forced down an audiences throat is not a good idea at the expense of good film making, I just don't think its the case here and I recommend the movie.",controversial

"If I were to pitch this movie idea to some Hollywood bigwigs, I'm sure it would sound like this: <br /><br />ME: ""Four boys at a private high school are good friends, AND they are witches.""<br /><br />Hollywood: ""That sounds like ""The Craft."" <br /><br />ME: ""No, no, I said four boys, not four girls."" <br /><br />Hollywood: ""That still sounds like ""The Craft"", just with boys instead of girls."" <br /><br />ME: ""OK, but there is this fifth unknown boy that comes into the picture and he wants more power.""<br /><br />Hollywood: ""Still not much difference, because one of the girls in ""The Craft"" also wanted more power.<br /><br />ME: ""OK, OK... I'll make these boys part of the ""in crowd"", they'll be rich, AND the school is on the east coast.<br /><br />Hollywood: ""Now that sounds original. That is nothing like ""The Craft"", here's a billion dollars."" <br /><br />This movie was so cliché and uninspiring. Even the manufactured drama between Chase and the brothers of Ipswich was very blasé. A bunch of rich kids, with their biggest problem being what color Bentley they want for their 18th birthday (and 18th car), don't interest me at all, even if they have powers. Every single kid in this movie looked like they stepped out of a magazine, and of course there had to be the gratuitous male nudity and female 80% nudity just to drive home how out of shape you are. I wanted to rename this movie ""The Witches of O.C."". Oooh, rich kids and their problems... let me pretend to care.<br /><br />This film was completely unimaginative and predictable.

It's sad to see such a highly anticipated Marvel movie be such a let-down. Also, the main character, who's a female by the way, is so bland and emotionless throughout the entire movie (with the exception of the little kid scene).

Flashbacks are meaningful (when Alice acquires a gun we know she has some familiarity with how to use it) and it does not end in cliché. The cast really ""sells"" their roles. It is adult material and the audio is a bit too grainy. Allow it 15 minutes to so to draw you in.",positive

"David Burton(Richard Chamberlain, quite good)is a lawyer, more adept at handling corporate taxation(..and suffers from unusual dreams which bother him seeing this aboriginal man shrouded in darkness), who is called on to take a case concerning a group of aboriginals charged with the murder of one of their own named Billy..we see that he tries to steal stones with ritual painting on them and is killed when a leader of an aboriginal tribe named Charlie(Nandjiwarra Amagula)uses a ""death bone"" to stop his heart. Meanwhile, revolving around David, bizarre weather patterns effect Sydney such as rain beating down polluted dirt and rock-sized hail during bright blue skies(with no sights of clouds, such as the one that hits a school in central Australia), not to mention, a ""deformed"" rainbow which is split(!)into groups. As David pursues the case he finds that he is far closer to the weird events taking place than he could ever realize. One aboriginal named Chris(David Gulpilil)appears to him in a dream holding a stone with blood and he finds that this man is one of those he is to represent at trial! He finds that it's quite possible, after some strange meetings with Charlie and conversations with Chris, that he very well might be linked to a spirit named Mulkurul and that his dreams are actual premonitions of possible horrors yet to come.<br /><br />Absorbing apocalyptic drama builds it's story methodically and is completely original and unpredictable. With Peter Weir in charge, the film is visually arresting as we see these very overwhelming images of possible doom towards civilization, but the film's most compelling angle is certainly David's journey to find that monumental truth that plagues him as he questions Charlie and Chris countlessly, at first to help his men get off from a crime they didn't commit, and ultimately to find out what he has to do with anything catastrophic that is occurring or might occur later.",positive

"Captain Marvel certainly exceeded my expectations. It had great visual effects and the overall story line was absolutely amazing and fluid. Captain Marvel was a very dynamic character that kept you on the edge of your seat wanting to know what side she'll take.The protagonists and antagonists were changing places throughout the movie, leaving the audience with no sense of security in one particular character. The only part that I was distressed with was the over-the-top social justice warrior and feminist aspect of the characters, diverting the actual concept of the movie from good beating bad to women empowerment. I am not against that, I just found it irrelevant in a superhero movie. The movie gave me a scent of nostalgia because of the star-wars like battles. If you noticed, Captain Marvel used the same method to destroy Korans ship as Luke Skywalker did with the Death Star.

Unfortunately, Brie Larson just fell flat as Captain Marvel.  I mean, where is the emotion? Is she supposed to be so stoic? I didn't feel anything, her anger, or frustration, or self-confidence.  There's just no endearing or defining  moment that makes me think Brie Larson can't be replaced by somebody more convincing or intriguing. Honestly, most marvel actors have really nailed their roles. Canu anyone replace  scarlet Johansson as black widow? No way'!  I didn't get that from Brie Larson. On the other hand, I really loved  roles played by Annette Bening, Jude Law, Samuel L Jackson. They're acting was a fantastic. Some of the 90's music was too distracting. I know they were going for a 90s feel, and I do love 90's music. But it feels forced at times. I was hoping  to see a story with some intelligent, clever problem-solving.  Unfortunately, I got a Mary Jane used a  sledgehammer to do brain surgery movie.

"Let me start out by telling the people who see every Marvel movie and television project but won't see Captain Marvel for some asinine, one sided feud you have with Brie Larson Ă˘"" get over yourself! The movie never brings up female empowerment even a little. The ending will still be attacked for doing so despite the fact that the scene is about a plane and has little to do with Carol Danvers. If nothing else, go to the movie for Stan. The Marvel logo at the opening is beautiful (and he's always had a Liberal agenda). Sorry people, but you've got to stop claiming political media wasn't around in the 60's and 70's.nnAll of that being said, Captain Marvel is just okay as a movie. Overall, the film did well with the 90's setting however it tripped on it's own facts. The line, Ă˘No one calls me Nick. Just FuryĂ˘? has already shown up in memes (Ă˘Ok, how about this time and this timeĂ˘?, etc.) Also, in Iron Man, which takes place in 2008, they have a running gag with Agent Coulson having to spit out Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division. Tony keeps blocking him, forcing him to repeat it until the end when he states, Ă˘Just call us SHIELD.Ă˘? The Captain Marvel film ignores this and everyone just simply says SHIELD throughout the movie. Captain Marvel is clearly a set up movie and Captain Marvel herself is definitely not Tony Stark. But Brie Larson, from what I've heard, is playing a comic accurate toned Captain Marvel and is not meant to be a witty Stark-like character. For that, she presented the character successfully.nnWhat would have helped this movie is if they actually used the TV-to-movie Ă˘~it's all connected' stuff as a build up. When Jessica Jones was being planned as an ABC show, Carol Danvers was the best friend character but Marvel Studios demanded that no set-up strings were to be put on Marvel Studios' productions. However, this movie needed some growing time. I think more people would have thought differently if she was already Ă˘~our girl'. Let's be honest Ă˘"" if Agent May had a cameo in Captain Marvel, fans would have cheered. There was no cheering at all in my theater and a lot of that is due to Captain Marvel not being a widely read comic. The Guardians of the Galaxy had a great comic run before their film, ensuring familiarity with the audience. Captain Marvel needed a more established fan base in order to be a much bigger success as a movie.",controversial
Movie was bad. It feels like it was made by people who had not taken the time to watch and understand the MCU. Larson work with what she was given... seem a little wooden half of the time.

"I recently got back from seeing Captain Marvel and here are my thoughts. Before I start, there a lot of sexist, biased reviews that are making this film look bad, but don't follow them. Overall it was a pretty good movie. As expected with Marvel Studios and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it expands on things already put in place yet feels so perfectly fit. It's not the best Marvel Studios movie, but it's a pretty great lead-in to Avengers: Endgame. Let me also say that this film takes place in 1995, just so less people are confused. Brie Larson makes the character of Carol Danvers fun, entertaining, and one of the most powerful beings in the MCU. Samuel L. Jackson has the best performance in the movie in my opinion and brings with it the best jokes. Ben Mendelsohn gives a great performance as the Skrull Talos, and I've always wanted to see Skrulls in these films. Jude Law gets interesting in his role, and that's all I'm going to say. Good performance, but very spoilery if I said anymore. the other characters give great performances themselves, with characters even returning from past films such as Guardians of the Galaxy. The action's pretty good with one very memorable sequence. I loved all the references to the 90s, Goose the cat is a great character. I really only have a couple of complaints. I feel like some of the line delivery and jokes were a bit forced, only in moments though. My only other complaint is that the First Act is a little slow. I feel like they could have made it just a tiny bit more interesting, but that's all. Of course there are 2 post credit scenes with one of them being very very exciting. The film also retcons some things within the MCU that I could see annoying many, but they didn't bug me too much. So this is a great addition to the MCU that I would give an overall 8/10. It's so surprising that as the 21st movie within the MCU, it can all still feel so fresh. And the movie starts with a fantastic and touching tribute to Stan Lee, and a reference to Kevin Smith that made me happy. So go see Captain Marvel now!",positive
"First of all I saw this movie without knowing anything about it I just knew that Joel Schumacher did it and that was enough for me. A friend and I went to see it at a Danish film festival called the night-film festival which is a lot of different movies shown after hours the festival pretty much specializes in showing movies that wouldn't otherwise be shown in Danish theaters.<br /><br />Anyway My friend and I went to see it and we were astonished at how real it seemed and that it really struck a cord with our feelings, we really got caught up in the plot without being able to figure out the ending which is a great plus in our book.<br /><br />The film is recorded in a style that reminds me of the Danish initiative ""dogma 95"" which was started by 4 Danish directors including Lars Von Trier (Dancer In the Dark).<br /><br />In conclusion the movie is really worth seeing it gives a different perspective on how things were for the American G.I.

I don't have any hate for the movie but the story was FLAT.  nThere is so much more to Captain Marvel that they could have done. Only good thing was seeing Sam Jackson and the guy that plays Coulson (that guy is an awesome actor).  Oh and the guy that Jude Law playing the bad guy did a good job too.  But yeah the plot sucked and that's what ruined it for me.  Also the whole montage of people telling her she couldn't do something (no one talks like that)was very very dumb.  I would of loved to see this movie put more effort into the story of the character than try to piecemeal so many different things that it lost itself.,negative
"In sum, overlong and filled with more subplots than swiss cheese has holes! The director and co-writer says he wanted to mix genres - in this case drama and comedy. Well, at least here, these two mix like vinegar and oil. To boot, the comedy is not very funny and juvenile. Additionally, the film is not really realistic. Liberties are taken regarding the legal system in committing French Citizens against their will and the apparent ease of absconding with drugs in French Hospitals. I watched this film on my big screen TV at home and found myself shouting at the film to move on. Eventually toward the end I fast forwarded the final long speech one of the main characters makes to his ex-lover's son. By that time I was worn out by the preposterous confused plot that deals with a dead lover, marriage of convenience and a nutty ex-lover. At times the plot diverts to the families of the two main characters and then reverts back to one of them - either Ismael or primarily Nora. To the detriment of the audience, viewpoints keep changing from Nora and Ismael, her ex-lover confined against his will in a psychiatric hospital. There probably are two potentially interesting films here neither of which are well developed. The epilogue does not really wrap up many of the sub-plots and seems to want the viewer to believe Nora somehow will find happiness although given her circumstances in real life the chances are equivalent to a snow ball's chance in hell. The actors do their best and are appealing, but this is not enough to overcome all the glaring faults of poor writing, editing and lack of focus.",negative
"A decent enough film. It was not terrible, but it wasn't good either. The world this movie creates has its charms and the performances of Sam Jackson Ben Mendelsohn were on par, but Brie Larson and Carol Danvers herself were heavily disappointing. Putting aside Brie's terrible attitude and behavior outside of her role, her performance was stale and the characterization they chose for this interpretation of Ms. Danvers is even more of a Superman than the man of steel himself. With no inherent flaws to ground her and make the character relatable, Captain Marvel comes off as less a champion and hero of earth and more a romantization of the modern offshoot of classical feminism. Marvel should take some pointers from DC's Wonder Woman who characterizes their heroine as a human to look up to, not a goddess who looks down on everyone who doesn't agree with her.",negative

It was a successful combination of all its elements from stories, cast and productions that made it exceptional. Lorne Green had his defining iconic character from this series.

""Dressed to Kill,"" while loaded with style and technical skill, is one of the tackiest thrillers I have had the displeasure of sitting through. The plot is absurd and tired.

"Overall quality of the film was ok but as far as marvel movies go it was terrible. Captain Marvel is like Superman, she is not an underdog. Her main trial to overcome was understanding how strong she is which is stupid. All the other marvel heroes followed that similar pattern except they were still the underdog in the fight. Ironman's villain had a stronger suit, Black panther's villain was a better fighter . Even Thor which was probably the strongest hero until captain marvel could not defeat his sister on his own. Captain Marvel is like the superman of marvel which makes her film terrible because you can not make a good film on someone who is fighting people who are incredibly weaker than she is. As a character she really didn't bring a lot of humer to the movie, that was main done by Nick Fury. With Fury her movie would have been trash.

"All day now I've been watching dinosaurs, and all day they've had the same fundamental problem.<br /><br />They don't believe in firearms. They just don't seem to have been _told_ about them or something. Bullets _bounce_ off of dinosaurs! Maybe it's because they became extinct millions of years before the invention of gunpowder, and the laws of physics were just different back then... Aah, no. Come on. If they're close enough to chemically operate today, they'd have to be vulnerable to fast (even subsonic) lead projectiles. It's that simple.<br /><br />Look, the toughest-skinned reptiles on the planet today, alligators and crocodiles, are completely vulnerable to basic rifle fire. They're nothing magic. You can shoot a pistol round right through the heavy scales on their backs. They don't take armor-piercing bullets or anything special. Small bullets penetrate them, they just don't kill them. Somewhat (but not REALLY) large bullets are preferred because the challenge (as with most game) is to kill the animal with one shot, so it doesn't run. (Hunters consider it immoral to allow prey to run off and die unharvested.)<br /><br />Most animals, including predators, are easily repelled by gunfire. Between the noise, and the pain of even a non-lethal wound, most will run away. An exception are big bears, which are so fearless that they're merely enraged by mortal wounds. Cape buffalo are regarded as highly dangerous because they are well known to charge when wounded. We've seen video of the big bulls of a herd of cape buffalo rescuing a calf from an entire pride of lions. A big cat will run if it can, but if it can't it will charge as a final act of desperation. Where a T.Rex would fit in this spectrum is unknown. Their behavior simply has not been observed. With these larger animals, safe hunting becomes a matter of applying an appropriately large and powerful projectile, and/or applying several of them rapidly enough to counter its charge. With a T.Rex, of course, this could be a serious problem. I've seen a T.Rex skull (they have one in the museum downtown) and carrying a gun big enough to bust that might be impractical. Chewing its neck off with lots of smaller fire might be a more viable approach. Small bullets would still _penetrate_ them, they wouldn't just bounce off just because the animal is too big to easily kill! <br /><br />So here we have Cortez and his men (this is _before_ the famous Mexican campaign, apparently) captured by American natives and scheduled for sacrifice on the pyramid. It appears that all those human sacrifices were about appeasing the bloodthirst of the pair of T.Rexes that terrorized the continent in the day. Rather than just having their hearts cut out and being fed to the lizards, Cortez et al talk the Aztecs into letting them hunt & kill them. OK, maybe they don't have M-16s like the guys in the ""Carnosaur"" series, but they _do_ have flintlocks, crossbows, pointed sticks (big ones, made from trees) and swords. Maybe that's a little less uneven than squads of soldiers with full auto, but they've several guys and I'd quickly bet on them over a dinosaur. Oh, wait, there's a _cannon_, about a 4-incher. That's just the ticket for busting a Tyrannosaurus' skull! So they lay a trap, with a squad of men, cannon, pointed sticks in a ravine, and lure the first T.Rex into it, using a pretty brown girl as bait. Cortez points out that they'll NOT have time to reload, so they'll have to close the range until they can be certain of their aim. T.Rex totally ignores their volley of flintlock fire, and we see both a crossbow bolt _and_ the cannon ball _bounce_ off! Forget it. End of credibility. A crossbow bolt would defeat Cortez' torso armor, and a 4"" cannon ball might penetrate the hull of a wooden ship! This would also _certainly_ get through the hide, ribcage, or skull of any animal ever to walk this planet. (Do you think a _whale_ could withstand a 4"" cannon ball?) And here's T.Rex, still standing, not even bleeding. So Cortez lures it to the ravine, where it falls onto the pointed sticks, which (I guess by magic) penetrate it and kill it. Yaaay, pointed sticks! <br /><br />The dinos aren't completely invulnerable to gunfire - they manage to put out an eye of the second one with a pistol. This runs it off, so it's NOT as mean as a bear or a buffalo, at least in the movies.<br /><br />They kill the second dinosaur with a bomb - made from a gourd filled with gunpowder and gemstones. My money would still be on the cannon. It's engineered function is to concentrate all the gunpowder's energy in one direction - toward the target. A bomb is a much more diffused application of force. A _real_ bomb (NOT a gourd bomb) has a steel casing which contains the explosion to extremely high pressure. (Think: pipe bomb vs firecracker.) A pile of gunpowder set on fire will simply go POOF. (Trust me on that one.)",negative
"This film has a lot of strong points. It has one of the best horror casts outside of the Lugosi-Karloff-Chaney circle: Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray, and Dwight Frye, plus leading man Melvyn Douglas. It's got all the right ingredients: bats, a castle with lots of stone staircases, a mad scientist, townspeople waving torches and hunting vampires, an ""Igor""-type character, a beautiful girl, even a goofy-haired Burgomeister. The soft-focus camera work is moody and imaginative. There's even some good comic relief nicely spaced throughout the script.<br /><br />But it's not really a monster movie because there is nothing supernatural going on in ""Kleinschloss"" (""little castle""). The plot revolves around the generic crazy scientist (nicely played by Atwill) who values his work more highly than human lives.<br /><br />It's not top-tier material, because of a ho-hum resolution of the plot and some embarrassingly bad dialog for Dwight Frye. But it's worth a look if you like early b/w horror pictures.",positive

It wasn't the worst marvel movie, but then there are like 22 at this point so that isn't exactly high praise.

"No, ""Lifeforce"" is not a great movie.<br /><br />It's not a good movie.<br /><br />It is, however, an average movie with some good effects and a compelling storyline (and, of course, Mathilda May). It may actually be one of my favorite SF/horror flicks for the very simple reason that they try to reason their way through the science of the space vampires. How often do you see that? Not even in ""Alien"" (the SF/horror flick of all time) does science come into the story at all. In ""Lifeforce"" they are trying to make reason of an unreasonable world.<br /><br />Now, do I think it's successful? No. I think the movie has the issue of a massive ensemble cast that Hooper is straining to keep collected and on track and that the viewers have to focus on more than one 'villian' and there are one too many road trips.<br /><br />To be honest, the movie is eye candy and fun to watch. but there is great potential here for a superior remake to take a hold of what Hooper was trying to do and really create a strong, scary, SF/horror movie.<br /><br />If the remake does happen, however, I demand that Mathilda May have a cameo.",positive

"After ignoring the die hard fans who 5 star and the trolls who no star I went in with an open mind to see what this film added to the MCU. I was let down during the first half of the movie, it seems they spent all the budget on the latter half causing the first half to be out of focus most of the time, dark and with various jump cuts which constantly brought me out of the experience. This was also compounded by the lack of utilisation of Brie Larson. The second half seems to be where the most effort was put into the story and post production with visuals more on par with what is now expected of a Marvel film. Overall this film adds very little to the MCU and most fans would be best to avoid it and just watch the post credit scene for the Avengers tie in.",controversial

"I remember watching Police Squad! when it first came on ABC in 1982 and I thought it was a very funny show, thanks to the many sight gags, non sequitors and scripts filled with word play. In one episode, there was a line where a man named Once was shot twice. <br /><br />But unfortunately, ABC canceled the show after only six episodes. I felt it deserved a much longer run but a network executive thought the show demanded too much attention of the viewer because of all the sight gags in each episode. One that I remember was in the opening where the episode's title was different from the one shown on the screen. <br /><br />Leslie Nielsen's portrayal of Frank Drebin was deadpan, yet very funny and his role was in the narrative style of Jack Webb of Dragnet. Alan North did well and Peter Lupus, in one of his few roles since Mission: Impossible wasn't bad as Norberg, But the one character that stood out was Johnny the Shoeshine Boy, played by William Duell. After giving advice to Drebin, there were cameos from Dick Clark, Dr. Joyce Brothers and then Dodger manager Tommy LaSorda. <br /><br />Even though Police Squad! had a short life on ABC, the Zucker Brothers didn't give up on the concept which turned out even more successful in the Naked Gun movie franchise.

"PLAN B has the appearance of a quickly made, unedited, sloppy script for a movie with the attempt for an outing for the actors involved - an outing that should have been nixed from the start. It is just another Mafia-based 'comedy' that has nothing new and lowers the standard for those participating.<br /><br />Joe Maloni (Paul Sorvino) is the crime boss more concerned about clothing and appearances than about his business of control. His personal assistant Mario (Anthony DeSando) is dumber than dirt and his ignorance is supposed to be funny. Maloni has whacked one of his debtors (who just happens to be married to bookish Fran - Diane Keaton) and Maloni takes Fran on as his assistant to work off her dead husband's debt by being Maloni's 'hit man'. Fran is afraid of her own shadow and is unable to carry out Maloni's assignments, electing instead to transport her 'whackees' to Florida to hide at her brother James' house until she can figure out what to do next. This alternative to killing the three candidates is called Plan B, Plan A being to kill them! The ending is wholly predictable just as is every line assigned in the script to the characters.<br /><br />Diane Keaton has made a lot of fine films and is one of our most talented actresses and comediennes, but here she screams and rants and twitches her way through a ridiculous part that quickly becomes annoying to watch. Paul Sorvino is, well, the Paul Sorvino type cast from other mobster films. The supporting cast is likewise allowed to play to the balcony in the broadest slapstick, pratfall fashion imaginable. What is supposed to be a comedy ends up being just silly and overdone. Director Greg Yaitanes needs to go back to TV sitcoms: had this flimsy story been compressed into a half-hour gig it might have had a chance. Grady Harp",negative

"Now infamous Western that was (at its time) the biggest budgeted disaster in Hollywood history. I was ""lucky"" enough to see the full 220 minute version at a theatre in 1990. It was truly staggering how BAD the film was!<br /><br />They had a great cast, a story based on a true incident (a fight between foreigners and Americans in the 1800s), magnificent scenery...so what went wrong? Three words--director Michael Cimino. He was so full of himself after ""The Deer Hunter"" he went out and made this god awful Western. He's not totally to blame. His previous film ""The Deer Hunter"" was considered a masterpiece and United Artists gave him free reign to do anything. They let him all alone...and everything went wrong. The cost went barreling out of control and Cimino insisted on redoing sequences again and again until they were perfect.<br /><br />First off, the sound is horrible. Entire sequences go by and you can't make out a word the characters are saying. For instance, Jeff Bridges' character is introduced during a dance sequence, but I STILL have no idea who he was! The dialogue in his introductory scene is incomprehensible! That's the director's fault--he should have made sure the dialogue could be heard. Some scenes are shot with so much dust flying around you can barely make out what's going on. The story line doesn't make a whole lot of sense and Cimino took great liberties with the facts--in the real story only one person was killed--Cimino turns it into a massacre. There is some admittedly beautiful sequences here totally destroyed by lack of story and incomprehensible dialogue. Also the bad sound was not the fault of the theatre--all the prints sound that way.<br /><br />This garbage effectively closed down United Artists and was the end of Cimino's career. A textbook example of a director so full of himself he doesn't realize what he's doing. Jeff Bridges has said this is the worst movie he ever did. This is from a guy who made ""Tron""! A definite must-miss.<br /><br />There is a pretty good book called ""The Final Cut"" which details the whole disaster. This gets a 1. I wish IMDb had negative numbers--this deserves it!",negative

"It was once suggested by Pauline Kael, never a fan, that Cassavetes thought not like a director, but like an actor. What Kael meant was his supposed lack of sophistication as a filmmaker; to take that comparison further, to me, it never feels like Cassavetes is directing himself in a film, it feels like Cassavetes implanting himself inside his own creation, like Orson Welles. Cassavetes is just as much of a genius as Welles, but far more important as a true artist (as opposed to a technician or rhetorician). This is like a cross between Italian passion (though Cassavetes was actually Greek) and Scandinavian introversion. Never before have inner demons been so exposed physically.<br /><br />It's about the mystery of becoming, performing, and acting. Like a haunted Skip James record, it's got the echoes of ghosts all around. Rowlands' breakdowns, which are stupefying and almost operatic, surprising coming from Cassavetes, are accompanied by a jumpy, unsettling piano. Who is this dead girl? The metaphysical possibilities are endless, and it's amazing to find this kind of thing in a Cassavetes film, just the overt display of intelligence (there is also a brief bit of voice-over at the beginning). But then, he always was intelligent, he just never flapped it around for easy praise. This is not ""Adaptation""; here, the blending of reality and fiction and drama is not to show cleverness but to show the inner turmoil and confusion it creates.<br /><br />There's so much going on. The pure, joyous love when Rowlands greets her doorman; the horror when she beats herself up... The scene where the girl talks about how she devoted her life to art and to music is one of the most effective demonstrations of understanding what it means to be a fan of someone. You can see some roots of this in ""A Star Is Born,"" and Almodovar borrowed from it for ""All About My Mother."" I think the ending is a little bit of a disappointment because of the laughing fits, but the preparation leading up to it is almost sickening. (You can shoot me, but I think the alcoholism, despite its urgency in many of the scenes, is a relatively small point about the film.)<br /><br />It's a living, breathing thing, and it feels like a process: it could go any direction at any time. Like ""Taste of Cherry,"" we are reminded that ""you must never forget this is only a play."" Yet it is dangerous: when Rowlands says that line, is it great drama? How will the audience take it? Is she being reflexive or does she just not care? Her (character's) breakdowns are incorporated into the performances, and ultimately the film, in such a way that it's like witnessing a female James Dean. 10/10",positive

"I've seen almost all of the MCU movies and have really enjoyed all of themâ€”except this one. I was hoping for a run ride, but I was bored throughout the movie. The story had a lot of potential, but nothing was well-executed except the special effects. Brie Larson was miscast. Her performance is emotionally flat and uninspiring. She delivers most of her lines robotically, and her attitude is snarky and smug throughout. Captain Marvel is a completely uninteresting character, who is not well-developed and who never undergoes any significant change or growth. I feel like we never really get to know who Carol Danvers is, which is a shame. The biggest shame is that Captain Marvel never really overcomes any significant internal or external conflicts, and doesn't exhibit any significant weaknessesâ€”which are the two things that keep super-powered humans interesting. A lot of the dialogue feels awkward and wooden, except for Ben Mendelsohn as Talos. There were a couple of good jokes, but most of the attempts at humor miss the mark. If you want emotional connection in your superhero movies, you probably won't find it here.

It had a nice plot with a compelling twist which drove story elements to keep you engaged but ultimately left the film confused as to who its main villain was leaving it in an strange space when compared to other MCU 'Super Hero' Movies. nIt was funnier than I thought it would be.,positive
"Well I like superhero movies which is the only reason why saying it's 3 start a little less hoopla involving its release and I'd maybe gone with the four as far as that goes not that inspiring and overcoming adversity agenda seems kind of pushed and disingenuous on the plus side I didn't fall asleep during it like the first three times I tried to watch infinity wars I have yet to finish that movie Ă°~, not a bad action movie to watch with my kids but nothing to think about .",controversial
"I found the movie to be okay. It seemed pretty predictable after watching the first Guardians movie. The majority of the casting I felt to be okay, but writing at most times to seem mediocre compared to other marvel movies. Yeah I got a few laughs, but the again the story itself just seemed abit bland. Another thing a found to be lacking is animation. The scenes in which CGI was used looked very awkward and cheap. I much more felt like I was watching a movie that would have come out 5+ years ago at times. The scene in which Captain Marvel are in space probably shoes the worst of this. She simply looks un-human. The biggest draw from this movie though is Carol Danvers. I won't directly blame the actress on her performance, but she just seemed uninteresting. I felt very little emotion from her character and felt no real character arc with her. Yes she learned the truth about herself, but her personal self didn't change. She started as a extremely cocky person and ended as the same way. I'd still see the movie so you don't miss any information when End Game comes out, but unlike most marvel movies I wouldn't go see it a second time.",negative
"Solid. enjoyed it. First action movie I've seen in a while where I thought: wow, slow down. But the pace was fun and my kids loved it.",positive
"On one level, this film can bring out the child in us that just wants to build sandcastles and throw stuff in the air just for the sake of seeing it fall down again. On a deeper level though, it explores a profound desire to reconnect with the land. I thoroughly empathized with the artist when he said, ""when I'm not out here (alone) for any length of time, I feel unrooted.""<br /><br />I considered Andy Goldsworthy one of the great contemporary artists. I'm familiar with his works mainly through his coffee-table books and a couple art gallery installations. But to see his work in motion, captured perfectly through Riedelsheimer's lens, was a revelation. Unfrozen in time, Goldsworthy's creations come alive, swirling, flying, dissolving, crumbling, crashing.<br /><br />And that's precisely what he's all about: Time. The process of creation and destruction. Of emergence and disappearing. Of coming out of the Void and becoming the Universe, and back again. There's a shamanic quality about him, verging on madness. You get the feeling, watching him at work, that his art is a lifeforce for him, that if he didn't do it, he would whither and perish.<br /><br />Luckily for us, Goldsworthy is able to share his vision through the communication medium of photography. Otherwise, with the exception of a few cairns and walls, they would only exist for one person.",positive
"I loved it. As a teen girl, not only was it awesome to see myself and my struggles reflected in this movie. Brie Larson was AMAZING and I liked that there wasn't a romance side-plot, other than Carol and Maria. (I ship it) It was also cool that she wasn't sexualized like so many other superheroines, even if she is very attractive.",positive
"Seemed contrived... doesn't follow the lore, Fight scenes were lacklustre. Brie may be a good actor, however there was no real emotion or passion in this movie. Sam and the cat were great, but what a poor explanation given for the eyepatch. C'mon give me a break. How screwed up is the MCU now. Was any thought given to the storyline we've been following for the last decade? Why was the audio mix so darn loud with the girl song, couldn't hear the action or dialogue (if there was any). Did a good eye roll at that part! Surely was not choreographed well! There's 13 bucks down the toilet. Oh and just to be clear, my daughter thought it sucked as well...",negative
"Not sure why my review hasn't been getting posted...But it was honestly just a disappointingly boring movie. Carol is just an uninteresting, emotionless brick of a character with no good backstory. Movie drags out way too long and all the developments in the story just feel forced. Definitely a let down, and has me worried about what to expect from endgame which I was really looking forward to prior to this movie.",negative
"I'll admit that I am a HUGE fan of Marvel and slightly biased to what they release, so I'll tone down this review:nnOverall, a decent, solid movie. It isn't amazing or among the best that Marvel has to offer but it certainly isn't among the worst. It's right in the middle of the road for the MCuĂ˘""fortunately, the MCU has pretty reliably produced good movies so this is not a bad thing. It has a fair bit of humor which helps, though it doesn't live up to Thor: Ragnarock. It is especially driven by the reactions of Samuel Jackson and it definitely rides the high off of Infinity War, but that's what it is supposed to do. It links a HUGE amount of things in the Marvel/Avengers universe that many fans love to see and it sets up Endgame even more.",positive
"Probably the worst movie I've ever seen don't watch this movie, it will ruin your night",negative
Definitely feels like a phase one film. Very sloppy and more concerned with an agenda then being apart of the MCU. OP character done poorly. I wouldn't be surprised if you don't need to see it to know why she's in endgame.,controversial

"My husband brought this home from the video store, so I could watch something while stuck home sick. The sort of sick where you could never concentrate on a book, but a sorta silly, light, romantic flick sounds just right (that, and a bowl of chicken soup). Well, he meant well.<br /><br />My first thought (as some others post here also) was that the house MUST be fake...it's not only isolated alone on the beach, but set on moorings into the loose sand, and so close to the ocean that the surf waves go directly under the house! This looks so obviously dangerous (in hurricane country, in THE FALL), so potentially disastrous that I was sure filmmakers had simply CGI'd the whole thing (or used movie magic to plunk a cute B&B into the surf).<br /><br />But I have to tell you guys, thanks to ""teh interwebs"", I can say that the house, ""Serendipity"" is very real, is indeed near Rodanthe and except for some window dressing and shrubs, appears mostly as it does in the film. You can rent it yourself, off season, for $1710 a week (or about $3850 in summer)! Go for it! But...interestingly, the house has severe problems. The second thing that struck me after ""would be washed away"" was ""what about the plumbing/electrical? in that surf?"", and sure enough, ""Serendipity"" was condemned for a break in the sanitation, caused by overwash from the ocean. (They are rebuilding.)<br /><br />And the house isn't from the ""Civil War"". Not to mention that Viola Davis, playing ""cliché black best friend"" (thankless role for a fine actress, last seen in ""Doubt""), is not remotely old enough that her GRANDMOTHER could have built anything in the Civil War! HELLO! that was 150 years ago! Try great-great-GREAT! (In reality, ""Serendipity"" was built in 1988, laughably recently.) <br /><br />The basic film is built on a typical Nicholas Sparks weeper, which means a lot of coincidence and trite predictable happenstance. It is also aimed in a very pandering way towards ""women"" -- you know, us women who love B&Bs, fusty antiques and knick-knacks...who dream of romance and guys who look like Richard Gere and dancing in the moonlight. Don't give us plot, or thoughtful character development; just set up some mechanisms and bring on the love scenes!<br /><br />Gere plays a plastic surgeon, who lost a female patient during a routine surgery for a benign cyst on her cheek. Of course, she died of an overdose of ANESTHESIA, so you wonder right away why the surgeon is guilted up and not the anesthesiologist! HELLO! where is that guy? Why is the wrong doctor feeling guilty?<br /><br />Gere has come to pout and confront the woman's husband, and is staying at the remote B&B...who should be there, why the ONLY OTHER PERSON IN THE INN...Diane Lane! She's a lonely divorcée, with rotten kids, and an ex-hubby who wants her back. While she's trying to decide about that, the cliché best black friend has her subbing as hostess at the B&B.<br /><br />Now, in the real world, if this set up ever even happened, the doctor would look like Ernest Borgnine...and the lonely divorcée, like Rosie O'Donnell. He'd spend his vacation horndogging 22 year old girls on the beach, while she sulked and thought about going on a diet. But this isn't the real world; I digress.<br /><br />The couple confess all, fall in love, a hurricane hits...they make love, fall in love, he has to go away, he dies and she cries a lot about that. The end.<br /><br />There, I've saved you from it; now you don't have to torture yourself or any male acquaintances (husbands, sons, boyfriends) from sitting through this tripe. Very wearying.<br /><br />Someone else asked why Diane Lane, a perfect tiny woman (whom filmmakers seem to love to cast, because she's just pretty and thin enough that most women would like to look like her, but she's 45ish and not over-the-top, so she isn't threatening) is constantly covered in big tarp-like shawls. This would make sense if she was chubby, but she isn't.<br /><br />Anyways, someone throw a pretty, paisley shawl over this film. So we don't have to watch it. Conclusion: read a book, unless you are too sick. If too sick, go to sleep.",negative
"Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys, but providing a compelling story that was easy to follow.<br /><br />The plot, backdrop, music and talent were all top notch.

"As an avid Marvel fan, i'm always very critical of how each installment in the MCU will play out. As an origin story and an essential part of the MCU, Captain Marvel not only delivers on every level, it neatly exceeds all of my expectations. I'm constantly bored with the cliche'd and vanilla plots that leave me feeling like I wasted my money. I'm married with three kids, going to the movies is EXPENSIVE. Please give me something that stands out otherwise i'm going to punch myself in the face!!! Not only does this picture make the two hours playtime seem like thirty minutes (which is a must if you have young ones), it delivers the action I crave from a superhero movie, and yet refuses to gloss over social issues present in our everyday lives. Human heroes should have human issues, consistent with the time, situation and circumstances....it's how we get to see what makes them a hero at all!!! And the twists, so many twists that I left with a ridiculously crooked charlie brown smile on my face. If you want to watch a good movie, watch something else. If you want to watch a GREAT movie, watch Captain Marvel.",positive

"(Mild Spoilers) Frankie Machine had been dealt a bad hand in life. A card dealer at an illegal gambling den in his Chicago neighborhood he was busted when the joint was raided by the cops and given six months in jail. <br /><br />While behind bars Frankie was treated for his heroin addiction at the prisons hospital and learned how to play the drums as part of his rehabilitation program. Now out of prison and back in his old neighborhood Frankie is trying to put his life back together by getting a union card in the Musicians Union and then a job as a drummer in a band and put his old life behind him but instead it catches up with Frankie in no time at all in ""The Man with the Golden Arm"". <br /><br />Otto Preminger's ground-breaking 1955 film about heroin addiction with Frank Sinatra giving the performance of his life as the drug addicted card sharp Frankie Machine, the Man with the Golden Arm. Frankie tries to getaway from the life that he lead but has this monkey or, better yet, gorilla on his back that just won't let him. Soild performances by the entire supporting cast starting with Frankie's friend Sparrow, Arnold Stang. Sparrows attempt to get Frankie back on his feet by shoplifting a suit of clothes for him ends up putting him and Frankie in the slammer, and almost back to prison, until his former boss at the gambling den Schwiefka bailed him out. <br /><br />There's Frankie's psychically as well as emotionally crippled wife Zosch, Eleanor Parker, who sees that her hold on Frankie is slipping and is slowly driven to madness murder and suicide. There's Frankie's drug dealer Louie, with Darren McGavin in one of his first acting roles, who's hold on Frankie is only good as long as he stays addicted and Louie goes out of his way to make sure that he does. <br /><br />There's the owner of the gambling joint that Frankie works at as it's top card dealer Schwiefka, Robert Strauss, who like Louie goes out of his way to get Frankie back to work for him even though if he's arrested again Frankie's hopes for a new and better life will go down the drain. And then there's Frankie's next-door neighbor and friend Molly, Kim Novak,who goes to almost impossible lengths to get him over his addiction by locking him up in her apartment. It's there that he goes ""Cold Turkey"" and almost ends up dying trying to kick the habit in one of the most harrowing sequence ever put on film.<br /><br />A no holds barred movie with explosive performances by everyone involved makes ""The Man with the Golden Arm"" one of the great classics of realism in motion pictures coming out of the 1950's.",positive

"A worthy and fun entry into the MCU. Where shouldnI start? This film and all the controversy surrounding it has made reviewing this somewhat of a paradox. I'll save you the backstory and cut to the film itself. I had my doubts walking into Captain Marvel, hoping to avoid getting sucked into anyone's Ă˘agendaĂ˘?nTruth be told, once the credits rolled, I left the theatre feeling satisfied and actually more excited for endgame to be honest.nMaybe it's the Nod to Generation X that sat dearly with menDuring the films clever musical ques.nMaybe it was finally seeing the Skrulls in full form, and being just as weird, creepy, geeky (and funny) as they are in the comics. And much credit goes to Goose the catĂ˘""but I'm sorry, Ben Mendelsohn stoke the show. His quips and motives were both funny and solid. He's just as crafty and likable as he was in Rouge One as he is in Captain Marvel. And of course, there's Brie Larson donning the role of Carol Danvers herself. I'll say this right now. She's badass as Captain Marvel and not as stone and emotionless as the trailers made her out to be. She belongs in the MCU. And somehow, the 90's setting worked for her Character. She's a stern but vulnerable Gen X Brat. If you grew up in the grunge era, you know what I'm talking about. The film uses a nice color palette of purples/Greens and of course, sky blue. And a young Samuel Jackson (Fury) running around 1995 L.A. was awesome to see. His CGI youth was downright amazing, even down to them shedding a few pounds off his frame. The soundtrack rocked (Hell yes Nirvana) it's got some sci-fi elements reminiscent of The Matrix and Star Trek, but it's the MCU, so it's got its own identity. This honestly was a great lead on tonAvengers End Game, and I just might see this again before that drops. I'm glad I didn't let the internet decide whether I saw this film or not.

"Will some company PLEASE make a (good+) DVD of this film!??? Aside from being a wonderful film about relationships and friendships, ""Four Friends"" is the ONLY film I've ever seen -- And I have, literally, spent *years* of my life watching films! -- that captures the essence of the 60s experience (and I was there!): the idealism, the hope, the freedom, the confusion, the betrayals, and ultimately its upbeat but bittersweet denouement. And all of this is accomplished without being a story about any of the numerous upheavals of that era, although many are just touched upon... as part of the tapestry. But the story is primarily about the characters and their friendship over about 10~15 years... and that those survived and deepened, despite the tragedies of that turbulent decade.

The main reason to watch this one is when Bobby Lo fights a lion, which is quite obviously a guy in a lion costume. Jang Lee Hwang is also the villain, who is usually pretty awesome but his screen time is significantly small.

"Despite its flaws, I enjoyed ""Cigarette Burns"", John Carpenter's Season One episode in the Masters of Horror series. Yes, the story seemed like a cheap cross between IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS and 8MM, but it was still quite good for the budget and time constraints given to it. With ""Pro-Life"", however, the low budget and time constraints definitely show more than anything else. There is solid directing as always from Carpenter yet there is a quality to the writing and whole production itself that gives the feeling it was made in a total and complete rush. The script isn't always clear, the message fuzzy, and the story is full of plot holes once you look back on them. Maybe had Carpenter re-written the script, it could have been a worthwhile episode. Instead, it's a mess that only hardcore Carpenter fans will find the slightest enjoyment in. Definitely the worst Carpenter has ever done. 2/10",negative

Plot is weak and has certain points that make no sense or appear to be empty. She doesn't age from the 1990s to Endgame which is a bit strange. The change from having Carol Danvers' origins as Captain Marvel robs her of character development and evolution that would have been better for its feminist undertones if she would have progressed from Ms Marvel to Captain Marvel.

"Surprisingly enough does movie does have some redeeming quality in it when it moves toward its end. For the other part this movie is being a really bad and lame one, with a small budget, insultingly bad written script and everything that goes with it.<br /><br />It's silly that with all the money going around in the Christian circles they never can seem to get sufficient funds to make a decent movie with. I'm not a religious, so I couldn't care less really but film-making does some like a good tool to reach a new audience for churches and getting people more interested and curious in reading the bible for instance. In that regard these movies always seem like a wasted opportunity.<br /><br />The low budget does really hurt the movie and brings it down. It makes the movie laughable to watch with its effects and it just gives the overall movie a campy B-movie like feeling.<br /><br />But what's hurting this movie more is its writing. The stuff that just happens in this movie is just insulting to the intelligence and then I'm not even complaining or talking about the religious aspects of the whole story. The way the movie progresses is just so improbable and the people within this movie do such highly unlikely things that it's being insulting to its viewers.<br /><br />I also hated how the movie was being like a soap opera at times. Seemed to me that they simply had a hard time turning this into a full length movie and they added in some characters and dramatic developments just to fill things up. I just couldn't cared less really at times.<br /><br />Still it needs to be said that the movie gets more solid and steady toward its end, when its story gets more focused on its essence.

Beside, the story of the movie really got me. What do you expected more than this! I mean, I'm not exaggerating anything, just my opinion. nAnd if u don't know why I don't rate it maximum, lol.

"My wife and I just saw the movie and we loved it! Brie portrayed Captain Marvel very well!

And oh, Goose the Cat stole one of the spotlights which made the film even more surprising! It was hilarious! On the other side, haters and trolls just have no appreciation with this kind movie, don't worry they're just capsuled with a lot of insecurities and delusional judgment...never listen to these nonsense-immature people!

"The movie is actually too slow. There are some nice images but it cannot outweigh the fact that the movie is in fact boring. You see a sexual intercourse a lot of watermelons and a sexual intercourse while eating a melon and maybe a little bit more. It may sound even interesting to someone but believe me to watch it for 2 hours isn't fun at all. Though you laugh several times but it's really not enough and it may be more out of despair and disbelieve than out of fun. To disturb the boredom director tries to put few movie video-clips into the movie. They are really colorful clips of absurd songs maybe from the 50's but it's hard to say exactly and they are trying to be funny so hard that it's really sad. Several times you have a feeling that the plot could evolve into something, that a powerful scene is being created but at the end it just somehow evaporates and that's it. Beside the clips there are hardly any dialogs let alone music. The director is trying to be original and artistic at all cost. Personally I cannot recommend the movie. I believe that art is something that shouldn't be boring. During the projection there was yawning all around the cinema which just corroborates my short review.",negative
"I think I expected more from Captain Marvel and maybe that's feeding the patriarchy it's trying to fight: to expect more from a woman than you do a man. I guess I felt Brie Larson was a little stiff and lacked the comic timing needed for a Marvel superhero, but Marvel origins do tend to be a lot of foundation work and that takes time away from the fun that Marvel is famous (to be fair, most jokes revolved around 90's references and were more corny than what we've come to expect from Marvel). I am looking forward to Captain Marvel returning and enjoyed getting more back story on the Kree. I loved the friendship between Carol and Lashana Lynch's Maria Rambeau - it felt very real. The special effects were on point - especially fascinating was the ""de-aging"" done on Samuel L. Jackson's Fury, etc. nAlso note: the only reviewers that have a problem with the ""feminist agenda"" are men. ",controversial

"The film maybe goes a little far, but if you love the show it's what you expect. It's not a bad movie; it's actually pretty good. If you don't like the show, don't see the movie. It starts off a little slow maybe, but then picks up and turns out to be pretty funny. There are even a few ""heart-wrenching"" scenes toward the end. After all the protagonists have gone through these scences do get to you. Also Jerry throws in his opinion why his show upsets people and justifies his show's existience. He's got a pretty good point. We care so much about the private details of celebrities lives, so why is it wrong that these people tell their private lives on national TV, too. If they were celebrities we wouldn't mind at all, we'd eat it up. Do we not like his guest doing this just because they're poor white trash and it reminds us that there really is poverty in this world and not just rich glamous movie stars living in a ""Leave it to Beaver"" world?",positive

"Is this movie good? The short answer is ""no."" Not even Samuel Jackson could save this one. This movie suffers from a massive problem....Brie Larson either can't act, or was unsure of how to deliver the character. Judging from her performance in Avengers: Endgame, I'd say she can't act. Her performance is, bland, flat, unmemorable, and disappointing. Fortunately, this movie can be conveniently omitted from your Marvel home library without disrupting the fantastic saga laid out by the other movies. Let's face it, the shelves at my local Walmart are fully stocked with this movie for a reason. It misses the mark on multiple levels : casting, performance, story, directing, and writing. When Nick Fury tells you the last time he trusted someone, he lost an eye, and your answer for this is a cat scratching it, you've just mailed it in. They were handed a golden opportunity to really use the eye situation to lay out some interesting twists. Unfortunately, they decided to answer that with the most insulting - seconds of Marvel cinema yet. And it's hard to screw up a Marvel movie these days. Keven Feige has the formula well in hand, you just need to show up. Do yourself a favor, pass on this movie, see the rest, and pray Kevin Feige cuts this character loose before Brie Larson does some real damage to it.",negative

"""Gone With The Wind"" is one of the most overrated movies in history. It is a film loved by mothers, grandmothers, and shut-ins who go to the movies once every five years. As a zombie movie, it blows. There isn't a shambling corpse in sight, and it's terribly light in the gore department. ""Zombie 3"", on the other hand, is big on shambling corpses and quite generous with its blood-spilling -- therefore, it is better than ""Gone With the Wind"". It is also not overrated. Most reviewers are under no delusions that it is rubbish. It is, however, not boring rubbish. After a terrorist steals a virus, he drops it while being pursued by a helicopter, and the chemicals leak into the ground. The terrorist, who has been exposed to the nasty concoction, hides in a hotel room where he slowly morphs into a flesh-eating zombie. One of his first victim's is a cleaning lady. Once she's bitten, Lucio Fulci's brand of hell breaks loose. As usual for a Fulci flick, the acting is atrocious, the storyline is riddled with plot holes, and the gore is plentiful. Turns out the film was directed by Fulci and Bruno Mattei, so that explains its rather schizophrenic nature. It is badly shot, too, poorly edited, and the sound design is flat. Still, it is saved by its gleeful adherence to the goriest of murders and its impatient pacing. Definitely worth picking up if you're an undead completest. Or don't like ""Gone With The Wind"", undoubtedly the worst zombie movie of all time.",negative

"I always wrote this series off as being a complete stink-fest because Jim Belushi was involved in it, and heavily. But then one day a tragic happenstance occurred. After a White Sox game ended I realized that the remote was all the way on the other side of the room somehow. Now I could have just gotten up and walked across the room to get the remote, or even to the TV to turn the channel. But then why not just get up and walk across the country to watch TV in another state? ""Nuts to that"", I said. So I decided to just hang tight on the couch and take whatever Fate had in store for me. What Fate had in store was an episode of this show, an episode about which I remember very little except that I had once again made a very broad, general sweeping blanket judgment based on zero objective or experiential evidence with nothing whatsoever to back my opinions up with, and once again I was completely right! This show is a total crud-pie! Belushi has all the comedic delivery of a hairy lighthouse foghorn. The women are physically attractive but too Stepford-is to elicit any real feeling from the viewer. There is absolutely no reason to stop yourself from running down to the local TV station with a can of gasoline and a flamethrower and sending every copy of this mutt howling back to hell. <br /><br />Except.. <br /><br />Except for the wonderful comic sty lings of Larry Joe Campbell, America's Greatest Comic Character Actor. This guy plays Belushi's brother-in-law, Andy, and he is gold. How good is he really? Well, aside from being funny, his job is to make Belushi look good. That's like trying to make butt warts look good. But Campbell pulls it off with style. Someone should invent a Nobel Prize in Comic Buffoonery so he can win it every year. Without Larry Joe this show would consist of a slightly vacant looking Courtney Thorne-Smith smacking Belushi over the head with a frying pan while he alternately beats his chest and plays with the straw on the floor of his cage. 5 stars for Larry Joe Campbell designated Comedic Bacon because he improves the flavor of everything he's in!",negative
"This movie is not that interesting, except for the first ten minutes. The pace and editing are a perfect introduction in an ensemble piece, even better than say Gosford Park. Then it inexplicably slows down, loses focus and starts resembling a traditional French movie only to regain focus in the end with the love relation between Antoine (Depardieu) and Cécile (Deneuve). In the middle there are too many sidelines and loose ends in the story, several threads started are not ended.<br /><br />*******SPOILERS AHEAD The main story is the relation between Antoine and Cécile. He has been loyal to her after his relation with her many years ago, despite her remarrying and setting up home in Morocco. As builder he now rebuilds his own life and recovers hers by taking the mask of Cécile's marriage. Having accomplished this, he is buried after a freak accident (literally) and becomes a comatose. He wakes only after she has burned their old picture as indication that they've reconciled with the past and can properly start their lives again together. *******END OF SPOILERS<br /><br />It remains unclear what vision this director wants us to see us because there are so many other stories here: Illegal immigrants want to enter Europe, there are frequent radio broadcasts about the overthrow of Iraq's former regime. Cécile's child is bisexual and is bitten by dogs (loyalty) once he meets his boyfriend, whereas the girl he lives with seems to be sick (of that?). Her sister is traditional Islamic, and enters a relation with Cécile's husband. It portrays Morocco as unnecessary backward, despite all the building there is a strange colonial vision shining through that almost glorifies the past. It portrays Islam as backward and prone to extremism, which may sometimes be true, but certainly not in general. In the end it can all best be described as adding some couleur locale and l'art pour l'art.<br /><br />Deneuve and Depardieu are great. With this material they are so familiar they are able to spin something extra in every scene: lifting an eyebrow, body language, radiating pride, awkward behavior. The movie itself is disappointing and only confirming the limited role of French cinema in the world nowadays. With some notable exceptions of course.",negative
"I don't know why, but Brie Larson didn't seem like she was committed to the role most of the time. There were a few instances where she delivered some emotion, but for the most part she almost seems like she's reading the lines. There were a few scenes that could have been very moving that was completely ruined by Larson's wooden acting. I know a lot of times these things can be partially blamed on the script or the directing, but the supporting cast actually does a great job most of the time. Sam Jackson is charismatic as usual, and the actress who plays Maria Rambeau, Lashana Lynch , was excellent. She carried the emotional scenes between her and Larson, which is a bit of a let-down because of all the hype this movie has had.

The filmmakers seem to have wanted to validate what they view as an unworthy platform by pushing what they think is a worthy agenda, without delivering good action, visuals, or a coherent plot. Brie Larson is uncharismatic to the point of being repulsive. I became depressed a little while through when I pictured the character being played by Gal Gadot, and how much her charm would've improved the movie. The cherry on top was how condescending the film is to men, who are easily the largest demographic of MCU fans.

"Uwe Boll has done the impossible: create a game adaptation that stays at least somewhat true to the game; he has turned a game full of antisocial and offensive content into a movie full of antisocial and offensive content. So, as an adaptation, it's a success.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's still Uwe Boll we are dealing with here, so don't expect the movie to be actually any good. while it does have it's moment, ""Postal"" wears out his welcome very fast and becomes a pain to sit through.<br /><br />At its core, Postal is a satire on the United States, as done by a twelve year old kid. Boll seems to think that offensiveness is linearly proportional to comedic value: the more offensive, the funnier, and the more exaggerated the funnier. This results in a movie that sets new levels of tastelessness while being extremely hit and miss. Yes, some gags do work but it seems to be pure luck. High points include the director satirizing himself, and people getting hit very violently by trucks and other vehicles. Low points include..well pretty much everything else.<br /><br />After the initial surprise wears off, Postal simply becomes a bore to watch. Yes there is a good joke every and good point ten minutes, but everything else consists of hordes of annoying characters shooting and chasing each other all over the place for what seems to be an eternity.<br /><br />This probably would have worked as a short movie, but it's just not enough content for something that lasts over 90 minutes (although it feels twice as long).

"I will be honest, I went and saw this movie twice. I really wanted to get a full understanding of what it was the movie had to offer. The second time i saw it i could take my ""hype"" and emotion out of the equation. What i concluded was that this movie was mediocre, at best. Larson's performance was dismal, the writing was atrocious and the directing was nothing special. The CGI wasn't half bad but if that's the highlight of the movie, than you surly will be in for a disappointment. The SJW agenda they were force feeding down your throat when watching this movie really put me off from giving this movie a better review. If people want to make our childhood superheros into movies, but what to add some new age flare to it, I am fine with that. But this movie executed on it poorly. If they wanted to make a movie more ""SJW"" friendly to us normy's, they should have taken some notes from Spider-Man Homecoming. That movie felt a lot more organic when it came to addressing some of these issue and I absolutely loved it. When you find out at the end of the movie that ""Michelle"" is ""MJ"" I was genuinely excited and happy. I was glad she would be playing that Iconic character opposite to Peter Parker. It felt great because you got to know the character and create that sorta of ""emotional attachment"" to her before tying her to someone iconic and hold dear to our hearts. Also, her chemistry with Tom Holland was really great. You could feel it through the screen. Captain Marvel missed that completely. Larson had little emotion and she failed on delivering it, even at the end when she found out about the Kree being the baddies and the Skrull being hunted. The only reason i don't give this move 1 star or lower is because I actually like the Skrull twist and Ben Mendelsohn & Samual L. Jackson gave great performances. This movie, IMO, ranks at the bottom of the MCU. I wouldnt saw its as bad as Thor the Dark World but I honestly didnt think it was better than Iron Man 2, and that is saying something.

"I hate that I felt the need to rush to defend a Marvel movie getting bad press, but I feel I must be Ă˘that guyĂ˘? and write up this Ă˘strongly wordedĂ˘? review.nnThe audience rating for Captain Marvel is currently like 30%, while critics are hovering just over 80%. I could see xenophobes disliking this movie, but it's honestly not overtly-feminist (or anything to the degree like some people have been saying) and she's really not all that over-powered as a superhero, at the end of the day. Yes, she does become incredibly strong, but no, it never feels like the win is being straight-up handed to Carol Danvers for the sake of it. It does, however, become slightly empowering for women (followed by a tinge of male humility) but it's not unfair or unfounded, and it isn't super oppressive in it's application, thematically. (Heck, there are multiple female characters with equivalent levels of humility endured, so to say this film is Ă˘radically feministĂ˘?, Ă˘anti-menĂ˘? or anything of that nature, is most likely a brash and absurd presupposition.nnThis film includes plenty of action, laughs, and classic Marvel surprises that still deliver, despite being part of a more recognizable formula at this point. If this were the last film in the Marvel canon to make full unfettered use of this formula, then I would say it was the perfect final execution.nnHonestly, things get pretty emotional too, but the context of everything might go way over the average action fan. It's super politically relevant, I think, as far as the state of war and military are concerned (regime change wars and refugee situations), but your enjoyment could strongly depend on how you feel about these issues. People who watch this film on a surface level, could definitely become disappointed due to the confusion of purpose. They'll probably sit there wondering Ă˘why is Brie Larson doing this?Ă˘?, which is fair, but only because this strongly depends on your own personal view of the military-industrial complex. That being said, surface-level viewers will ultimately miss out on a lot of the more wholesome story elements we've come to expect from the Marvel franchise. Comic book and sci-fi action fans should be more than pleased with the spectacle of this film alone, and anyone looking for a good time is sure to find it in a younger-looking Samuel L. Jackson and a lovely orange cat named Ă˘GooseĂ˘?.nnAlso, &*@! everybody saying Brie Larson ruined this movie. She's a top-tier performer and she gave a top-tier performance. Everything she said about the film industry prior to this release, in regards to diversity and representation in media, is founded in fact, and garners no ill-will towards anybody, objectively speaking. She wasn't any more stiff in her acting than Carol Danvers would be in person, as a strong-willed, militant woman. nnFinal Score: 9/10, there were some odd decisions being made at the Ă˘Department of Rushed CGI""",controversial

Like the next movie is just gonna be 5 mins long.nI can go into so much more detail if necessary.

I didn't know what had happened when the movie was over, but I find life is that way. It didn't bother me. The unfairness of the ultimate rejection of an innocent character strikes me as sadly real. I loved the faces, the way the camera dwelt upon them. The camera gazed at the set with the unfocused eyes of a daydreamer. Borderline was real to me in a way movies aren't. It was exactly the lack of explanation, color, sharpness that made it enter my consciousness like a thief in the night. I love this movie. Someday I will own it.",positive

"Pretty darn good for a French film. I have not seen any of Catherine Breillat's previous films, and so have no opinions about this compared to her previous work. French cinema usually sticks to the ultimately arty films, and leaves the shoot-em-ups and star vehicles to Hollywood. That is probably a good business strategy, as no other nation's film industry will likely have the resources to compete on those sorts of projects. Films about film-making are often a bore, as it has little resonance for people not in the business. But this one held my interest much more than I thought it would. In spite of the title, (oddly in English) it really isn't much of a comedy, in spite of a few droll moments. I've only seen a few of Anne Parillaud's films, but she shows a generous amount of talent and range, from the action/psychological drama of ""La Femme Nikita"" to the wry comedy of ""Innocent Blood"". This film also extends her range as she plays a more or less ordinary woman, yet is still compelling on the screen. Kudos also to Roxane Mesquida, with whom I was unfamiliar. She plays a very inexpressive actress for most of the film, whose talent is drawn out at the end. If you don't HAVE to have car chases and explosions to be entertained, check this one out.",positive
"As the title suggests there is a philosophical, meritocratic thread running through this film: if a man has the talent and looks to find his way into society and money what might be the outcome if he is denied it for failing to have the X factor? This question is unsatisfactorily dealt with in this adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's book and left me rather cold along the way.<br /><br />Matt Damon is the Ripley of the title and apart from blagging his way on a funded jaunt to Europe falls under the spell of his commissioned target, Dickie Greenleaf (Law). Homoeroticism and social insecurity get all tangled up in a violent conflagration which escalated and complicate themselves for the rest of the movie. Law, Damon and the damningly pleasant Paltrow as Dickie's girlfriend are OK. I liked Philip Seymour Hoffman's cameo-ish Freddie Miles, the bluff society friend that Ripley can never be. The problem is that the story is lumpen without arc - or redemption, for that matter - which makes it rather difficult to swallow. 4/10",negative

"""The New hope of Romanian cinema""...if this is the new hope, then i wouldn't really like to see the saving hero of such a prolific cinema(Romanian cinema, that is). Now seriously, where should I start? 1. The crappy scenario: are you kidding me, this is not even believable not to mention it's high degree of stupidity 2. the Direction: what direction? This movie should have had psychological tension, at least that, since they have decided to make it look as trashy as possible. Oky, I admit, Radu Muntean is no Polanski, Hitchcock, Fincher or Lynch(the list could go on), but at least the minimum of effort would have been appreciated. 3. The language: Oky, I don't understand why (almost)every single Romanian director believes that if you make the movie as miserable and obscene as possible, then you have art. I don't mind explicit language or bad image quality as long as the final result makes it worthwhile. In this case, it doesn't. There is nothing to comment upon, since everything this movie wants to say was already told thousand times, the characters are far too thinly portrayed to become memorable, the ""shocking events"" that occur are also poorly illustrated and become unimportant. This film relies only on the self-induced emotions, on the ""we must"" hype. Someone was found murdered so ""WE MUST"" feel sad, frightened or panicked, someone went through this and that so ""WE MUST"" feel in a certain way. That's baloney. Because a movie is a piece of fiction, nothing is for real here. So the only true emotions are those that you discover when you wander deep into it's world(the movie's, that is)<br /><br />*/* * * * *",negative
"I thought this was a real below par marvel movie, belonging with the likes of Hulk, Thor 2 and Ant-Man and the wasp. I feel they did not write the character properly as she has no real character arc and Larson delivers every line with the same sarcastic deadpan tone. I felt I never got to know who the character was nor was I given any reason to root for the character. nnMendelson as the Skrull leader was excellent but he was underused and the writers missed a great opportunity of developing the Skrulls as serious antagonists for the MCU in the future. I was going to the movie hoping a secret invasion story line would develop for post endgame but a serious opportunity was missed here by the writers. Character wise it was propped up by Jackson. Mendelson and even the cat as the other characters were not very interesting either. nnThe visual were poor and not very stylised compared to the likes of Ragnarok and Gaurdians. The battle at the end was hard to make out and felt anti climatic. nnThe film was certainly not horrifcally terrible but it certainly wasn't good nor up to the standard that Marvel has produced.

It will make you tear up at one point, yet still gets its jokes in... However without the forced non-stop slapstick of Ragnarok. The return of Shield, Fury and Coulsen were great. Brie Larson is not as magnetic as Gal Gadot was in Wonder Woman, however she does an admirable job, is tough, and will be a great addition to the team in Endgame.nnI'll admit it does have some noticeable flaws. Some scenes feel slightly rushed or unexplained, there's occasional awkward acting, and some poor song selection at times... Which is actually my biggest critique. The 90's song choices don't have the same feel good effect as like the 80's songs in the Guardians movies. However none of that took away from my enjoyment of the movie. You can nitpick apart any movie if you try hard enough. And people certainly are with this movie. Considering how many negative user reviews occurred prior to the movie even coming out, I'm positive those people just have an ax to grind, and reviewed before even seeing it. It's sad people can't keep their biases out of this stuff. But I guess that's the highly subjective internet age we live in today.nnDo yourself a favor and go see this movie.

"Why bother to see this movie? It probably rates an award for being the worst career move of a major movie star since Clark Gable's laughable playing of an Irish patriot in Parnell.<br /><br />It's inconceivable that Bergman would choose both this movie and its director over a lucrative Hollywood career where she could choose among the finest scripts and directors being offered at that time. To begin with, there was no script to work with except a few notes. Then we are supposed to believe the polished Bergman as a poor refugee willing to do anything to be released from a refugee camp, including marriage to a poor Italian fisherman she doesn't even love. I read where Anna Magnani was the original choice for this part. If so, that made a lot more sense than to cast the luminous Bergman in such a proletarian part. But since she was in love with her director, common sense flew out the window.<br /><br />So she goes to live in this poor village where the men must toil to extract a meager living from the sea. A place she obviously hates to be and where she doesn't fit in.<br /><br />Her only friend is the village priest who knows she's not suited to the life of a poor fisherman's bride, but tells her that for the sake of love she must repress her true feelings of revulsion, and accept the poverty and despair she encounters each day. On top of all of this, there's this volcano always on the brink of erupting and drowning them all in hot lava. But like a true heroine, Bergman revolts against her misery by declaring war on just about everyone else in this dreary film. She even goes as far as trying to seduce the village priest, in a scene that would generate laughter if it were not so pathetic. Since her poor slob of a husband must lock her in a room to keep her from running away, she's forced to use her body to bribe a married man to take her off the island. To her, no sacrifice is too great; no man unapproachable if he is willing to help her to escape the island and her misery. I won't bother to tell you how this all ends. The no-script movie ending is as plausible as the rest of STROMBOLI. I even remember (from seeing it on late night TV) that it had two different endings! So be warned if you should feel brave enough to sit through this king-size turkey and catch the miscast Bergman. It led to her downfall in Hollywood for the next seven years and she was condemned for sleeping with her director while still married to Peter Lindstrom. None of the movies she made with this director(whom she later married) are noteworthy except as proof of a career gone berserk. I kid you not. It's pretty embarrassing.<br /><br />- - SoundTrack",negative

"This is a good film for 99% of the duration. I feel that the ending has occluded this film from higher acclaim.<br /><br />It is shot in a rather naive fashion. This is clearly done to create a more chilling feel to the film - a feeling of isolation becomes apparent very soon on due to this filming technique.<br /><br />The gruesome characters are very well acted and presented especially the 'nutcase' called Joe. However, the wholesome (normal) characters are a little too pathetic for my liking - granted, they are supposed to come across as pathetic but this is done a little OTT.<br /><br />The film starts slowly (and the naive camera work smacks of 'B' movie to start with) and very normally but you soon get a feel of the impending brutality that is about to occur. This is one of the most 'twisted' movies with respect to cold-hearted violence.<br /><br />After the abrupt and unbelievably lazy ending I was left feeling disappointed. I would have given the film a 9 if the ending was in keeping with the rest of the film but as it is it gets only a 7 on the strength of the 'eeriness' and nail-biting scenes earlier on in the film.<br /><br />Give it a watch and excuse the ending!",positive
"Unfortunately, this was my least favorite Marvel film, and I really wanted it to be good. I was excited about it for so long only to be utterly disappointed. Brie Larson was one-note the whole film, and couldn't summon even an iota of mirth during her ""comedic"" moments. She was quite literally monotone the WHOLE FILM which left me bored. Her co-stars out-shined her by light years. Yikes.nnYou're met with memories at the start of the film where all she does is get herself hurt, and the idea is that it is all due to men keeping her down, somehow. What is unfortunate about this is that overall the terribly weak feminist message behind it was that it's okay to be reckless, and irresponsible because somehow magically you won't die, or be permanently injured and thus show all them penis toting folks what's what... or something.nnIn her struggle against the Supreme Intelligence she goes back through her same memories from the beginning of the film, and it shoes that while she may have failed, she got right back up. To me, this was fine. Not letting failure get you down, and having the strength to get right back up and try again until you succeed: This here is a good message. Don't let failure control you (except for, you know, doing stupid shit that can get you killed LIKE SHE DID).nnThere was a final scene between her and her mentor Yon-Rogg who had been trying to help her curb her emotions (sure, for the good of Kree so that she may be used as a weapon given that she is most likely powered by the tesseract) decided he wanted to go fist to cuffs with her instead of flashy powers and weapons. She was all, 'I have nothing to prove to you.' and blasts him across the map. Now, I know this was to be more funny than anything else, but I saw it as another moment where she just sees an easy shortcut, and totally ignores the fact that had she NOT fell back on his lessons to curb her emotions and focus then she would never have been able to survive her fall form orbit, and ultimately went badass and single-handedly defeated everyone.nnI think that if you want a good ""Girl Power"" film, then this is not it. Wonder Woman has got it here in spades. Captain Marvel was bland, and I felt that between Brie Larson's complete inability to feel anything with her script and the rest of the cast, and the fairly all around boring script writing, any message that they tried to get through to the audience was undermined entirely. Ultimately, the film fell flat. I think the proof in the pudding in terms of weakening their message was when they tried too hard with the soundtrack choices. Every scene while on Earth was some song by TLC, No Doubt, and so on only to have the fight between Captain Marvel vs. Supreme Intelligence accompanied by Nirvana's ""Come as you are"", and it was at this point I realized the directors didn't actually care, and most probably lost interest in the film altogether.nnIn terms of female empowerment songs, they didn't even try. They honestly should have left the soundtrack gimmick to GotG.nnThe best part of the film? The 2nd secret scene during the final credits, and that is saying something.nnAs one of my best friends said: The better Captain Marvel movie comes out in two weeks. Sadly, I couldn't agree more.nnSome positives of the film: The shape changing abilities of the Skrull. Super cool, and fun to watch. Little bits of Nostalgia were pretty good as well. The train fight/chase scene was also neat.",controversial

"Yes, this film has many gay characters. It also has straight characters, characters who are not sure about their sexuality, people who are searching for some truth about their existence. <br /><br />This is not a film about sexual orientation. It's about loneliness and the difficulty human beings often experience in connecting to one another. Filmically, Denys Arcand cleverly balances the various dimensions of the relationships and the contrasting, constantly shifting relationships. The serial killer element is a bit less successful (it feels more like a way to wrap up various plot points and, unlike the rest of the film, is thematically heavy-handed). <br /><br />Thomas Gibson centers and grounds the film; it's a quiet performance but behind the handsome, arrogant exterior he slowly reveals a terrified soul afraid of showing or accepting love from those around him. The supporting cast is strong, especially Mia Kirshner as Gibson's friend, a dom-for-hire with precognitive powers. Her role is more metaphor than a literal conceit---strangely innocent and depraved at the same time, she represents the light and dark of the characters' sexual consciousness. <br /><br />The film's involving and often surprises in its character development. The effect is somewhat like Robert Altman directing a David Mamet script---the dialogue doesn't shrink from some searing observations aside from a few contrived moments in the beginning. Often, in our search for love and a conventional ""relationship"", we ignore the love that already exists around us---in our friends, family, those who are able to see us as we are. Arcand and the writer, Brad Fraser, make some canny observations on the different ways human beings try to escape and deny their loneliness and how that denial returns to haunt us in so many unexpected ways.<br /><br />This film is a rewarding experience. It may not be for bigots who can't get past the sexual orientation of some of the characters to see the greater, transcendental message of hope and redemption. Loneliness is a universal experience. A film like this, that dares to explore the darker side of our lives with a clever and perceptive eye, deserves applause and an open-minded approach.",positive

"Occasionally one is served a new entrée from foreign films. That is their great attraction. They take from life and serve it up raw. American films, rarely dare to touch the forbidden subjects of society. Too many hang-ups and a morbid fear of financial failure. The Almighty dollar, determines their selections. Something which invites European directors. In addition, audiences world wide remain hungry for ""different"" films, especially those which offer a savory bite out of the wretched, suffering body of humanity. Despite the fear of directors or producers, many audiences yearn for beauty, poetry, and the pristine flavor of life. That is what the film ""To the Left of the Father"" offers to curious audiences. A family locked in the belief that unity of family stems from the unity of it's obedience to tradition. Yet when the patriarch of a family forgets it's members are flesh and blood humans, filled with raging, unbridled dreams and dark passions, then the two are set in motions against itself. Selton Mello plays André a son who seeks to control his inner passions with the stagnant philosophy of his father. Raul Cortez plays his Father.

What I really admire about this film is that the director has chosen a story appropriate to the short format. These are genuinely interesting characters, and their story is told in the perfect length of time. This is no small feat. Haven't we all seen shorts that are simply longer stories squeezed to fit the format, or stage stories that weren't properly adapted to screen?

Hans Zimmer's score is also a typically simple and bland work of this overrated, untalented composer.<br /><br />But if you are willing to watch the movie further you are rewarded with a very moving family story, a sort of European version of Edna Ferber's family epos Giant. While at first you wonder why Clara married this idiotic man, even his character gets more depth and more background one can judge him by. Clara delivers the movie's spiritual lesson, a great and moving statement set against the terrible happenings in her country. Her daughter, whose lover is a young Antonio Banderas at the beginning of his international career, understands that lesson and ultimately tries to live by it. The way the plot was constructed with the ending mirroring the beginning was great. The actors all do a great job, too. I was wondering ""Who is the actress playing Blanca?"" all the time, but of course, it was a really young Winona Ryder!<br /><br />All in all, this movie really made me want to read the book.",positive
"Otto Preminger, completing a noir cycle at Twentieth Century Fox, reunited his ""Laura"" leads for this stark, gritty detective drama. Dana Andrews again portrays a cop, but this time he's hardened, cynical and has been accused of police brutality by his superior - ""You don't hate hoods, you liked to beat them up!"". Mark Dixon (Andrews) despises criminals, as his own father was a crook. He doesn't want to be ""Sandy Dixon's kid"" so he became a policeman, but his methods are harsh and hated.<br /><br />One night, investigating a murder, he unknowingly punches a suspect, Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) so hard that it kills him. A shaken Dixon does his best to cover it up, intending to frame a hated thug, Scalise (Gary Merrill) for the crime. However, the blame falls on Paine's father-in-law, Jiggs Taylor (Tom Tully), whose daughter, department store model Morgan Taylor (Tierney) is estranged from her husband but keeps getting drawn into his gambling schemes. Paine had slapped his wife, enraging her father, who did show up at his son-in-law's apartment, but not until Dixon had departed with the body. With no better suspects, Jiggs is arrested and charged.<br /><br />Riddled with guilt, Mark falls for Morgan and offers money for an attorney. He decides to take on Scalise anyway but leaves a letter to be given to the department in the event of his death, confessing everything. In the end, he cannot live with the knowledge with what he has done, and he permits the letter to be read by his superior and by Morgan. Despite all the tragic circumstances, Morgan professes her love for Mark and will wait for him.<br /><br />It was great to find this film on DVD, after so many years of televised obscurity. Eddie Mueller, a film noir historian, provides the commentary and does a good job, but I find his assertion that audiences wouldn't have caught the significance of the casting of the two leads, since ""Laura"" had been made six years earlier. In that respect, he is mistaken because they had appeared in ""The Iron Curtain"" two years prior to WTSE and the film was a box-office success.<br /><br />Andrews and Tierney were fabulous together, and Ruth Donnelly is tremendous comic relief as restaurant owner Martha, fanning the flames between the detective and the dame.<br /><br />The night cityscapes give the film an air of menace. Gary Merrill is great as the low-life Scalise, who had a criminal past with Dixon's dad (""Your father liked me,"" he taunts Mark). Karl Malden and a young Neville Brand are terrific also. And Tom Tully is just touching and funny as Morgan's unjustly accused pop.<br /><br />A watchable film noir with a fantastic cast.",positive
"78%, you say? Not in my book. And let me just say, I don't hate this movie because the main lead is a woman. That would be stupid. I hate it because I think it had potential that it didn't use. We're going back in time before the Avengers, seeing how all of it started, Nick Fury as a younger man, and another superhero! And yet, it misses its mark. It tends to use the same joke just a little too much. ""Remember this from the '90s?!"" The action is not well-choreographed at all. Just look at the fight on the bus. It cuts in the wrong places, it feels tired, and seems to go by too quickly. And the second worse thing is our lead: Ms. Marvel (I'm not calling her the other thing). I don't what the director or the actress was thinking, but Carol Danvers is as bland as a piece of cardboard. She speaks with the same tone in almost every scene, doesn't say anything that makes me care, and doesn't seem like a good role model. Then there's a twist in this movie with the villains that is so generic, I almost clocked out. And finally, the worst thing: this movies answers why Nick Fury has a scarred eye. It is an insult to his character. But at least he got to drop an f-bomb, right? Get out while you still can; this movie sucks",negative

"I really felt cheated after seeing this picture. It felt like I sat watching this movie 101 minutes for nothing. I don't understand what they were thinking when they made this. It hardly gets into Jeffrey Dahmer murdering and it has no ending. It felt almost like they were leaving this movie open for a sequel. It was like watching a television episode of the Sopranos. It ends suddenly, and you know there's going to be another episode next week. It also felt like I just watched part 1 to a two part movie. There are many possibilities for what went wrong here; they got lazy, they ran out of money, they didn't know the rest of the story, they wanted to make a Dahmer 2. After seeing this movie they all sound very accurate. I was watching Jeffrey Dahmer walking through the woods. All of a sudden I hear this music playing, then writing comes on the screen and says how Dahmer served 2 years of his sentence and was attacked by a fellow inmate and killed at the age of 34. Wow, he goes from a walk in the woods to his death in jail. How about showing how he got there. How about showing Dahmer's trial. How about showing some more detail. I can't even explain what happened in this movie because it jumped all over the place. I actually found myself saying in disbelief, ""That's it, that's the end?"" I want to conclude this review by saying there is still a good Dahmer movie yet to be made. To the filmmakers I'd like to say, if you're going to do it, do it right.",negative

"I agree that Capital City should be on DVD. I watched this show only by accident in 1994 and fell in love with Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. It was nice to see Americans who work abroad in London in the financial industry for a change. I loved Rolf in this role and loved every other role that he has been in. I can't believe the show only lasted 13 episodes. I liked William Armstrong as Hudson's flamboyant charming friend in the series. When they aired this show in the New York City area, it was always late at night or at off times. The show is less than an hour long. I felt this show should have gone on longer but the casting changes in the second season really made the show a little less interesting. I didn't care for Sylvia but missed the actress, Julia Phillips-Lane in the previous season. I felt this show took chances and often it worked. It showed Americans who loved and chose to live in London. The American characters were not arrogant or tried to outdo their British counterparts. I also liked the fact that they had tried to internationalize the cast rather than make them all British. I liked watching Julia Ormond in an early role. I felt this show should have lasted longer. I felt at times that the previews lasted as long as the show in less than an hour. They could have transferred the cast to New York City and it would have been a hit in America.",positive
"From the beginning of the film I found myself laughing trying to keep quiet so I did not wake anyone in the house, this didn't continue so much throughout the rest of the film, I didn't find everything completely ""laugh out loud"" funny, but still I found certain things quite funny. At the beginning I had to hold in laughter when he drops the very crafty looking Hand Grenade down his sleeve. Then there are scenes where you will just smile, like when the Barber falls through a roof into someones apartment, I can see that being quite funny but in todays days and time that has been done quite a lot it didn't feel original, though at the time, I'm sure it was. I loved Hynkels (Hitlers) bursts of raging German with the nice subtle English translation.<br /><br />The final scene is wildly discussed because, well it's absolutely true, and so very intelligently constructed. Though the film is sixty eight years old the final scene is still relevant today, if this doesn't show how great a writer Chaplin is, then I don't know what will. The acting in this scene in particular was quite good, the Barber transcended the message perfectly and makes you realise the serious nature of the film, at the same time enjoying the humorous side.<br /><br />Another element about this film is the fact that this was such a brave film, that almost feels ahead of it's time. Of course, Chaplin did not know what was going to happen after 1940, he was not aware of the Holocaust (obviously), he's also gone on record as to saying if he had of known he would not of made this film. The fact this film is so anti-Hitler is interesting, it's more interesting that it wasn't anti-Germany which would be very easy to have done back in those times, Chaplin could of easily made this a propaganda film, but instead did something more, he made an honest film.<br /><br />I recommend anyone remotely interested in this film to see it, as well those who has studied or is studying Hitler and WWII to watch this film. It's entertaining to say the least, it doesn't have an annoying out-dated feel that some films of the time did. Unlike most ""comedies"" this film actually has a message it tries to bring to you, watch this film, you will be better off for having seen it.",positive

"I am 17, and a biased Muppet fan, and while I love Treasure Island, Christmas Carol and Great Muppet Caper, The Muppet Movie absolutely deserves to be up there with the best of them. It is enormously entertaining, thanks to the snappy script by Jerry Juhl, and the film looks lovely, with some beautifully staged musical numbers. Speaking of the songs, I really liked them, sure they aren't the best song score out of the Muppet franchise, but they were very nice to listen to, especially Never Before. Never Before is now one of my favourite Muppet songs along with First Time It Happens and Professional Pirate. The Muppets as usual were fantastic, particularly the always delightful Miss Piggy, and the chemistry between Kermit and Fozzie was great. And what a brilliant human cast- from Bob Hope to Orson Welles, from Madeleine Kahn(the same wonderful actress who brought us hilarious movies like What's Up Doc?, Blazing Saddles and Clue) to Cloris Leachman, from Steve Martin to Richard Pryor, all of whom made memorable guest appearances, if careful not to overshadow the Muppets in a fantastic film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",positive

"While in a plane, flicking through the large choice of movies, I came across Live! almost accidentally. oh boy! what a choice.<br /><br />I remembered vaguely seeing the trailer over a year ago and completely forgot about it expecting no more than another cheesy nonsense movie about a stupid reality show. Now I can easily say this has been a hell of a ride. I don't remember last time I have been so excited, terrified. Not sure if it was the high altitude playing with my senses, but the suspense grow gradually through the movie until reaching a climax where you can't turn away from the screen, literally sitting on the edge of your seat and biting the remaining nails you've got.<br /><br />You will first go through a personal moral assessment of where you stand about the righteousness of the show. You will drift from thinking ""how come the human being can be so vicious"" to ""why not after all?"".Ask yourself would you do it. Then learn about the contestants, their motives and start guessing. You will then watch contestant pulling the trigger one by one and get excited even though you know the first candidate is safe.<br /><br />Good acting, good directing, with a movie experience that reminds you those old movies where you knew what would happen in the next scene but still were craving for more.<br /><br />*Spoilers* couple of things i would have changed:<br /><br />- the casting of the contestants. i have really been moved by the farmer and we should have had a bit more like him. The idea of a rich writer who wants to be famous is a bit stupid, it felt like you didn't care about some of the contestants. Although this might have been done on purpose, i think the audience should have been able to associate with the majority of the contestants. - game rules, a big glitch :<br /><br />what happens if the 5th contestants doesn't die when he pulls the trigger. do you seriously think the last standing guy will pull the trigger and execute himself!!! they should have given a chance to all contestants to live, ie: if 5th is a blank too, then no one dies.<br /><br />interestingly I haven't been bothered too much by this bad points cause i really had a good time. just wish i had some popcorn with me!",positive

"TV News producer, Jane Craig (Hunter) meets Tom Grunick (Hurt), an up-and-coming news presenter, at a seminar, and their mutual attraction takes them back to her room. Romance, however, is cut short, when it emerges that Tom is, in his own words, ""no good at what I'm being a success at"", and Jane realises he personifies everything she hates about where TV news is going. The rub comes when Tom reveals he is about to join her news bureau in Washington.<br /><br />Jane and Tom's initial attraction is therefore given a second chance, but will Jane be able to put aside her professional opinion of the man she finds herself attracted to - and should she? Aaron Altman (Brooks) is Jane's highly intelligent reporter colleague and confidante. Despite his obvious talent, Aaron's career is stalling as he lacks the confidence and people skills - and the classic good looks - to be the success that his new, less qualified and less intelligent colleague - Tom - is becoming. He is also concerned that his good friend Jane maybe falling in love with Tom, despite her better judgement, as it becomes increasingly clear that Aaron has his own romantic feelings for her.<br /><br />This central romantic plot is set within the trials and tribulations of a TV news network office, where moral dilemmas and ethics are wrestled with quickly and where appearances and dramatic effect are becoming more prevalent and important.<br /><br />This is where most of the bite comes from with well-observed comment and scenes. One of many moments is a scene where Tom meets the Network's top anchorman, Bill Rorich (a cameo role for Jack Nicholson), for the first time, and the camera focuses on their handshake. In a film full of great lines and dialogue, long and short, you realise a lot about these two men's character from this one quick shot of two hands.<br /><br />The dialogue between characters is amongst the most intelligent and witty you are ever likely to find anywhere on film and in such abundance. Brooks gets the best portion of them, in line with his character, but even the briefest conversations that are incidental and perhaps over-heard by one or more of the characters as they move through a crowded room, should be listened to.<br /><br />Hunter is a tour-de-force in this role for which she was rightly (and not alone) nominated for an Oscar, and for which she probably would have got if it was for a role in a film that didn't mock part of what had become a closely related industry - and against a strong performance from another actress in a more traditional feel-good, rom-com.<br /><br />Brooks is also excellent as the constantly frustrated and occasionally too-smug-for-his-own-good, Aaron Altman.<br /><br />Hurt, whilst possessing the looks and providing the personality required of his character, does not always convince that he is quite as dim-witted the character says he is or is supposed to be. He displays a latent intelligence that enables him to make the most of his apparent limitations, which may be plausible, but I don't think Hurt quite pulls it off. Apart from when he tells us he ""stinks"" or ""doesn't get it"", Hurt comes across as a bit smarter than that. Otherwise it is an effective performance, in a role where his character is compromised by its intellectual limitations, but Brooks and Hunter slightly overshadow Hurt's performance. It is the only negative thing I can say about the whole film, and who is to say that anyone else would have done it better, or come off any better, when next to Hunter and Brooks and their performances in this movie.<br /><br />Support is ably provided by, amongst others, Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles and Joan Cusack, and there is also a bit-part role for Christian Clemenson of subsequent Boston Legal fame, and the briefest of bit-parts for Joan's brother, John Cusack, whose face you don't even see.<br /><br />James L Brooks has provided us with many great TV shows and movies, and this film should rank up there with the very best of them. It may not have won any Oscars, despite seven nominations, but it did win plenty of other awards, and turned Holly Hunter into a star.",positive
"Not only does the film's author, Steven Greenstreet, obviously idolize Michael Moore, but he also follows in his footsteps by using several of Moore's Propaganda film-making tactics. Moore has expertise in distracting the viewer from this focus though, while Greenstreet is obviously less skilled here.<br /><br />Having been privy to all of the issues surrounding Moore's speech at UVSC, I was disappointed to see that the major complaints of the community -- that Moore was being paid $40,000 of the State of Utah 's educational funds to basically promote John Kerry's campaign and to advertise his own liberal movie -- were pushed to the background by Greenstreet while lesser issues were sensationalized.<br /><br />The marketing methods for this video have been equally biased and objectionable... promoting the film by claiming that ""Mormon's tried to kill Moore"". Not only is this preposterous, but it defames a major religion that Greenstreet obviously has some personal issues with. I followed Moore's visit very closely, and all of the major news agencies noted that Moore's visit came and went without any credible security problems or incidents in Utah.<br /><br />Greenstreet has banked on this film to jump-start his film-making career to the point that he has even dropped out of film school to help accelerate this. This seems to have been a severe miscalculation though, since Moore's visits to roughly 60 other colleges and Universities across the country in 2004 diluted interest for this rather common event. Greenstreet's assumption that American audiences would be interested in this film due to the promoted religious and conservative angles doesn't seem to be well founded.<br /><br />Even the name of the film, This Divided State, is somewhat of a misnomer since Utah voted overwhelmingly for Bush's re-election and thus appears to be more politically unified than any other State. The division in the movie title seems more indicative of the gulf that exists in Greenstreet's ideological differences with his religion and State. If anything, I find a humorous correlation between the religious angle of this supposed documentary and Woody Allen's hilarious contention in Sleeper (1973) that, ""I was beaten up by Quakers"".",negative

"My wife is a teacher and she is very familiar with the story, having read it to several of her classes. It never sounded all that interesting to me, though, and I bought the DVD figuring this would be a movie that wouldn't really be up my alley.<br /><br />The first half of the movie has a lot of set-up and I found myself thinking that I was right. It starts off a bit slow and I have to admit that I was a little bit bored - but curious enough to stay with it.

"This is a dramatic film in the whole sense of the word. It tells a tail that here in Greece we live as a routine in everyday life without realizing how sad it is. Sure it has some extremes.. but every now and then real life sorrow surpasses art.It is deeply critical of the goals we pursue and the whole social structure build around them. The film has a deeper understanding of Greek ways of life, stereotypes, and social structure. Unlike most Greek films that have a certain fast-food-mainstream audience, this one does not target anyone in particular but while you watch it you feel that someone put the best possible words and pictures to describe your feelings. I am not a big fan of traditional music either but I wouldn't like to hear anything else when it was played during the film.<br /><br />If someone told me to say something against this film I'd define the following, sometimes the transition between scenes seemed sudden or somewhat cut.

"Pity the Monkees. People always accused them of being manufactured (which they were) or being nothing more than a American knock-off of the Beatles (Again, which they were) but to the kids of the time they were real, they were important, they were legitimate. Discussions about who were better The Monkees or The Beatles were common on school yards but the critics, well they never quite bought into it. Despite recording some very catchy, classic pop tunes, the Monkess did not receive much respect for their albums. Sadly a similar fate was met by their one movie vehicle despite the fact that it stands as the best band film ever. Beatle fans may argue that ""Hard Days Night"" was better and I am sure that many of the kids think ""8 Mile"" was superior but none of these films were as daring and inventive as ""Head"" and that is probably why it failed.<br /><br />If Head had told a direct A to B type story perhaps it would have appealed to the bands young fans but by pushing the envelope and using the movie opportunity to mock their own image they really sabotaged the film with their fans. Could you imagine Eminem turning to the camera and actually talking about how sad it is that he is the best selling guy in a genre in which only 5% (and I am being generous) of the acts are white. If you can picture that than you have an idea how daring it was for the Monkess to sing ""Hey, Hey we are the Monkees. You know we like to please. A manufactured image, with no philosophy"". When you have a film in which Frank Zappa tells Davy that he should focus less on the dancing, and more on the music its clear that there is a lot more going on then you expected.<br /><br />The story, what there is, concerns the boys trying to flee their manager, who at one point forces them to play dandruff in a commercial, but every time they run away they end up inside a box. I don't think you need to be Fellini to figure out the symbolism of that bit. Some neat little comedy bits follow with Davy as a boxer who has to give up playing the violin to take a dive in the big match and Peter refusing to throw away a ice cream cone he does not want because there are starving children so its wrong to waste food but the real selling point to this film is the music and its some of the best the band ever recorded. Even if you are put off by the story, you can sit back and enjoy some terrific music.<br /><br />Any film that begins and ends with Mickey attempting suicide by jumping off a bridge (at the end the band follows him) is never going to be a mainstream classic but if you are a fan of either the band or experimental cinema of the era than you will enjoy this film.",positive

The story might be the cutest romantic little something ever, pity I couldn't stand the awful acting, the mess they called pacing, and the standard ""quirky"" Japanese story. If you've noticed how many Japanese movies use characters, plots and twists that seem too ""different"", forcedly so, then steer clear of this movie. Seriously, a 12-year old could have told you how this movie was going to move along, and that's not a good thing in my book.<br /><br />Fans of ""Beat"" Takeshi: his part in this movie is not really more than a cameo, and unless you're a rabid fan, you don't need to suffer through this waste of film.<br /><br />2/10",negative

"When I first read Armistead Maupins story I was taken in by the human drama displayed by Gabriel No one and those he cares about and loves. That being said, we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of Hollywood...<br /><br />Writer Armistead Maupin and director Patrick Stettner have truly succeeded! <br /><br />With just the right amount of restraint Robin Williams captures the fragile essence of Gabriel and lets us see his struggle with issues of trust both in his personnel life(Jess) and the world around him(Donna).<br /><br />As we are introduced to the players in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably. The request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event that helps Gabriel find the strength within himself to carry on and move forward.<br /><br />It's to bad that most people will avoid this film. I only say that because the average American will probably think ""Robin Williams in a serious role? That didn't work before!"" PLEASE GIVE THIS MOVIE A CHANCE! Robin Williams touches the darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people. Like his movie One Hour Photo he has stepped up as an actor and made another quality piece of art.<br /><br />Oh and before I forget, I believe Bobby Cannavale as Jess steals every scene he is in. He has the 1940's leading man looks and screen presence. It's this hacks opinion he could carry his own movie right now!!<br /><br />S~",positive

"Directed by Jacques Tourneur (Cat People, Out of the Past, Night of the Demon) and written by Phillip Dunne (How Green was My Valley) Anne of the Indies is a quite interesting adventure pirate movie. Its main character of captain Anne Providence is based on a real woman-pirate Anne Boney who actually lived and sailed through 18th century's Atlantic.<br /><br />The film begins with the sea battle where Anne's (Jean Peters) pirate ship attacks a trade ship that was on its way to Europe from the South America. As a result a treasure of great value is captured along with a handsome French officer Pierre La Rochelle (Louis Jourdan), who is taken prisoner. Anne ends up falling in love with him and apparently her feelings are reciprocated but it's only till she sets him free when she discovers that he has a beautiful young wife Molly (Debra Paget) with whom he pretty much in love with. Anne begins planning revenge on both of them but in an unexpected twist of fate ends up making a great sacrifice in order to save them instead. The pirate movie cliché figure of `Black Beard' also makes his appearance here, this time played by Thomas Gomez.<br /><br />Though Anne of the Indies probably appears to be no more nor less than a revisiting of pirate movie clichés, it still has its classical moments in beautiful visuals and sea battle sequences filmed in Technicolor as well as in some aspects of the story and most of all in personal touches in directing of all of it by Jacques Tourneur. 7/10",positive
I think this movie was generic at best. I feel like I've done a lot more with the superhero seeing as how I I grew up watching and reading the comic books.

"This Harold Lloyd short wasn't really much; not one of his funnier efforts. Of course, I never see bratty kids as anything hilarious. That's what the bulk of this story is, Harold and his wife, Mildred Davis, babysitting his in-laws two young kids. One is a baby who is constantly crying and the other is a four-year-old terror who does everything but demolish the house. Letting the kid create havoc over and over was not entertaining to me.<br /><br />The best part was the last four or five minutes when the couple thinks that this big goon (Noah Young) is burglarizing their house. Half the time it's the pet cat scaring the couple, but overall, that segment is fun with some good sight gags, reminding me of another Lloyd short, ""Haunted Spooks.""<br /><br />However, the good ending doesn't save the whole picture, which I probably wouldn't watch again. Lloyd has done too many other good things to waste even 25 minutes on this one again. It just isn't that funny.",negative

"""Babette's Feast"" and ""The Horse's Mouth"" are the two most insightful, accurate films on what it is to be a real artist. The key lines in ""Babette's Feast"" are not, as some other commentators here have said, ""an artist is never poor,"" but two lines that come before and after it:<br /><br />""I was able to make them happy when I gave of my very best. ... Throughout the world sounds one long cry from the heart of the artist: give me the chance to do my very best."" <br /><br />I spent nine years producing experimental multi-media music theater in San Francisco, raising money for productions that involved dozens of singers, actors, designers, etc., and the artists I supported stretched every penny in their effort to do their very best. They were just like Babette: they were desperate to get every dollar necessary to do their very best work. Babette's art is fine French cooking, and for her to perform her art at its very best costs 10,000 francs. When, after years in political exile from France, isolated with two caring spinsters on a bleak Scandinavian coast, she suddenly gets a windfall of 10,000 francs, she does what every real artist would do: she sees that she unexpectedly has the chance to do her very best, and so she does it. She spends all the money so that she can do her very best work as an artist. The twist in the movie is that we don't know she is such an artist, until she is actually cooking and serving the meal. Up until then, she appears to be just a working-class French lady who haggles a bit with the tradesmen, and is very serious (her husband and son were murdered in Paris violence in 1871). <br /><br />To such an artist, it is secondary whether there is an audience for the art that is competent to appreciate it. That is why the author set this dinner in a community of people who could not possibly have any understanding of what they are receiving. Babette did not cook this meal as a gift to the two spinsters, or to the religious community. It was not her goal to achieve a reconciliation or spirit of good feelings among the members of the little religious sect. Indeed, she never once leaves the kitchen to speak to any of them. After the meal, she is sitting alone, sipping some wine, not paying the slightest attention to how the guests reacted. She is basking in the satisfaction of finally having the chance to have done her best as an artist. <br /><br />That is why it is so satisfying, and so important to the story, that the General unexpectedly shows up -- for, as Babette knows instantly, a general will know what she has placed before him, and will appreciate it. For there is a sort of tragedy in a great work of art being shown to an audience that lacks even one person competent to appreciate it. She is glad, very glad, he came, in fact he is the only guest she ever mentions during the entire dinner, the only one she singles out for special treatment -- not either of the spinsters. But she did not plan the meal knowing that such a person would come to receive it. <br /><br />To anyone who has had the chance to enjoy a real first-class Parisian dinner, as I have (my father was Naval Attache to Paris in the 1980s, and I had my honeymoon in France), this dinner, and Babette's satisfaction in making it, and the pleasure it brings to the diners, is absolutely convincing. If any art has the power to suffuse the recipient with a sense of joy, it is a fine French meal cooked and served in France. This movie makes a claim about the transformative effects of great art on the recipients. Before the dinner, the members of the little religious sect are quarrelsome, dredging up old resentments. The old hymns fail to restore good fellowship; people ignore them, talk over them. But the shared experience of sensual great art -- for the people can enjoy the tastes of the foods and wines even if they have no conception that they are experiencing great art -- contents the people, puts them in a forgiving mood, reconciles them, and by making them happy, encourages them to love each other, and thus has a god-like sacred effect of bringing peace. This is the claim found in the modern art movement today -- that art can supplant the traditional religions in making mankind more peaceful. Thus, contrary to those commentators here who say that this film speaks for the power of Christian belief, it is more accurate to say that the film claims that art can heal wounds that Christian ritual cannot. After all my years in the art world, I have to say that this claim -- that art brings peace that religion cannot -- is overblown and invalid. But it is a pretty conceit and it is the second main theme of this beautiful film.<br /><br />One last note: at Babette's arrival at the spinsters' home, a particular French general, Galliffet, is named as the person who in 1871 executed Babette's husband and son, and imposed a military rule that she had to flee. At the end of the film, as the General tells the story of the magnificent meal he enjoyed in Paris many years before (before 1871), at the conclusion of some military maneuvers, it turns out that this same Galliffet was his host at the meal. As the General tells the story, French general Galliffet praised the chef of that meal as the greatest woman, the only woman he would risk his life for. Of course, that woman was Babette. Thus, ironically, the same French general who said he honored Babette above all other women was responsible for driving her away from France forever.",positive

"(Some Spoilers) Early 1930's educational movie about the horrors of contracting a social disease and the consequences that come along with it: blindness madness loss of ones abilities to function as well as infecting other people with it, even one's unborn children, and finally death.

Out at a party one evening Donald meets Elsie Cooper, Charlotte Merriam, and together they have one drink too many and before you know it end up spending the night together in Elsie's home. <br /><br />Thinking nothing of his one night stand with Elsie Donald later marries his long time love Joan and they both plan to have a child, or so they thought. At the office Donald get a panicked call from Elsie telling him to come over to her place right away about something very important. Rushing over Donald finds out, to his horror, that Elsie has a sexual infection that she got from her boyfriend Nat, Harry Myers, and that she may have given it to Donald, and he in turn may have infected his wife Joan. Telling Elsie that she's wrong about him being infected and that she should seek medical attention Elsie shoots herself as Donald is just about to leave. <br /><br />Getting over Elsie's tragic death Donald gets another surprise later when his doctor Dr. Bill Hill, Jason Robards Sr, comes over to his office telling him to immediately come with him to the hospital to talk to Infectious Disease Specialist Dr. Vincent Leonard, Murray Kinnell, about his wife Joan who's just been admitted there. The terrible truth about Donald and his wife Joan hits him like a bolt out of the blue and leaves him speechless, just like it did Joan earlier. Both have been infected and the infection is the dreaded and unspeakable,back in the 1930's, infection called Venereal Disease. <br /><br />Told by Dr. Leonard that it would take some two years of treatment for both Donald and Joan to be completely cured it leaves Joan in a state of dangerous suicidal thoughts. Later in the film Joan, feeling that she has nothing to live for, closes all the windows in her and Donald's apartment and turns on the gas stove, full blast, in order to kill herself and Donald who was asleep at the time. <br /><br />Honest film about the ravages of Venereal Disease and the damage that it does to those who are infected by it, both psychically as well as mentally, and how it could be cured if given immediate medical care instead of hiding it from one's doctor and keeping it hidden, for fear of shame and embarrassment, until it's too late.",positive

"A Scanner Darkly, Minority Report, Blade Runner, Sin City and Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow  if you are a fan of any of these then this will be well worth checking out.<br /><br />French animation project 'Renaissance' took seven years to make on a shoestring budget and tonight I finally got to see it at a private screening for the International Film Festival in Stockholm. My spontaneous reaction is awe; my further reflection is 'huh, neat' and closer analysis regrettably gets a resounding 'meh'. It is a gorgeous science fiction triumph on the surface, but scratch it or even poke it a little and its unnecessarily complex plot becomes glaringly apparent, as do the flat characters. <br /><br />Nevertheless it is clear that the people at Onyx films have done something spectacular with the aforementioned surface. The visuals are staggering. They have used live action motion capture fitted into key-frame animation, with stark jet black and bright white contrasts and a heavily shadowed rotoscoped background. For those of you who are not down with the 'technical lingo', the film looks like a fully-animated Sin City. Its fluid, transparent, dark and stylized template is complemented by great lurid lightning. It's a vision. Yet much credit is also due to the crisp sound effects that take the form of humming futuristic weapons, suspenseful music, heavy raindrops and glass shards breaking. It's every tech-nerd's wet dream...<br /><br />The film zooms in on an eerily-lit, bleak, futurescape Paris in which a major corporation called 'Avalon' has begun to interweave in the lives of the citizens with surveillance (think the fluid transparent screens from Minority Report) and genetic engineering. The latter leads to a mysterious kidnapping of young researcher Ilona (voiced by the lovely Romola Garai). Cut to our hard-boiled cop-on-suspension and protagonist Karas (Daniel Craig)  a man who takes the law into his own hands  who is assigned the case of finding and retrieving Ilona. During this case, he is being aided by Illona's sister with whom he also begins a love affair. A very half-assed love affair, if I may say so.<br /><br />The world of Renaissance is remarkable. Director Christian Volckman takes a fair jab at melting the noir themes and the result is an urban jungle filled with cads, rats, femme fatales and lonely detectives that hide in the shadows of the seedy slum. The problem is that the creators undoubtedly felt the need to have extremely clear and spelled-out archetypes in the story, or the film would have been ""too surreal"" for mainstream audiences, owing to its lurid animation format. It follows then that we have a multitude of clichéd characters such as evil-laughing villains, sleazy crime bosses and butch tough-chicks who blow smoke every chance they get. It shoves noir in our faces, and it isn't necessary.<br /><br />What is worse is that the dialogue is a little contrived. It seems as though every line exists for the sole reason of propelling the plot. This is nothing fatal because the plot is so complex once it gets going that it needs some clear direction. Daniel Craig helps here too by bringing a no-nonsense attitude to his hard-edged cop character. At one point in Renaissance, he is seen in a vivid car-chase that surely is one of the most adrenaline-pumping and top notch sequences of the film. Unfortunately, the novelty of the sci-fi visuals have worn off post this car chase and 'Renassaince' could benefit from being slightly shorter. In summary, a very interesting but flawed futuristic comic book experience.<br /><br />7 out of 10",positive
"poor acting, range of emotions on Brie was laughable. Writing is inconsistent and doesn't fall in line with the rest of the universe. It's demeaning and offensive to the other films.

She never really grows as a character, just realizes that shes overpowered at some point and can suddenly use god level powers without learning how to first.

Similar to the movie, the character in the comics is flat and extremely unlikable. The way fury loses his eye is straight disrespectful to actual fans. The comedy is subpar. The special affects are where they should be. The acting was meh, but the script was a dumpster fire. And don't get me started on the pacing of this movie.

"Actor turned director Liev Schreiber (The Sum of All Fears) does an above average screen version of the novel, Everything Is Illuminated, by author Jonathan Safran Foer. This tale of journey and self discovery is highlighted by strong ensemble performances and sharp direction with a storyline that enriches and enlightens the soul.<br /><br />Jonathan Foer (Elijah Wood) is a young man who has seen his grandfather, Safran, pass away. Jonathan has a peculiar habit of taking small objects and life's little memorabilia and sealing them in plastic ziplock bags to display them on his wall. Safran gives Jonathan an old picture showing a young Safran standing next to a beautiful girl who saved his life many years ago. Thus Jonathan commences on a long journey to locate this mystery woman in the Ukraine not knowing if she is still alive. He enlists the help of a brash, young tour guide named Alex (Eugene Hutz) and his grandfather (Boris Leskin) to drive him to his goal. At first the trip hits dead ends and false leads, but as the group nears its target, the men find themselves amid the ruins of a dark chapter in history with the memories of war and the past ghosts of a nonexistent town. There, they find their own respective destinies and will be forever changed by what they learn.<br /><br />This film feels like it was directed by someone who knew how to get the most from his actors. At times, the film is spoken in Russian and seems like a foreign film. The title itself is a play on self discovery. This is a thoughtful trek of one man into his past, and his past ironically involves his companions; Jonathan's obsessive journey becomes an emotional journey for Alex and his grandfather as well. It's a tale of bonding over the long haul and the guilt one must carry for a lifetime. By the end of the film, these characters have all experienced life altering events that will permanently intertwine their lives. It proves that memories can be powerful in traumatizing and also cleansing the soul. It's also about one's legacy and how others view an event or a person in the past. Alex eventually sees his grandfather in a completely different light. Even our perception of these individuals will have changed by film's end which is a tribute to a story that is well told.<br /><br />The story is deceptively simple. It functions as a road trip movie (like The Straight Story) combined with an interesting mystery story. It really involves a great many layers of emotions and subplots that range from the past to the present. The ending is a bit surreal with its déjà vu feeling.<br /><br />Elijah Wood (Sin City, The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind)) has chosen a wide range of roles ever since his splash in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Here, he does a fine job with what is essentially a minimalist role with not much to show. Eugene Hutz and Boris Leskin fare better as Alex and his grandfather respectively. Even the grandfather's dog named Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. (that's right) is funny as a fiercely loyal companion.<br /><br />The spare music score by Paul Cantelon is a moody compliment to the thoughtful nature of the film. The editing is effective as imagery from past and present are linked and transitioned effortlessly. The cinematography by Matthew Libatique (Gothika, Requiem for a Dream) is appropriately stark and lifeless with some impressive images of war and its aftermath.<br /><br />The coincidences that emerge during the last half of the film make for good drama but are a little too coincidental. We never fully understand the whole background story of Alex's grandfather and what his motivations are. Likewise, Jonathan's blank stares and lack of apparent substance and depth do not give us much more than a sketch of a quirky man. At times, the film feels a little downbeat and depressing as more horrific revelations are exposed. But these are minor criticisms of what is a good, introspective story with good performances and interesting themes of remembrance and closure. That Schreiber not only directed but adapted the screenplay to this worthwhile slice of history is a tribute to his talents and promising potential in the future.",positive

"Ettore Scola is one of the most important Italian directors. My parents and I watched together ""C'eravamo tanto amati"" on a summer night: we liked it, but we didn't love it as we loved ""A special day"". I believe Ettore Scola is pretty underrated: we often forget to remember him, maybe because his latest films were disappointing. And so, yesterday night, my mum and I sat on our sofa to enjoy this masterpiece. Writing, direction, cinematography, score and production design were sober and accurate, but the thing I liked the most was the chemistry between Loren and Mastroianni. They're both excellent actors and play the main roles of Antonietta and Gabriele. Antonietta is an housewife: married with a fanatic Fascist, she has six children but her husband wants to have another child to get a prize for the huge families. Gabriele is simply an Anti-Fascist.

"I had heard this film was a study of a landscape photographer's art by presenting the beauty in man's deconstructing the natural landscape. It certainly showed the laborious activities to find locations, setup shots, and capture stark images whose final destinations were art studios worldwide. Put together in moving pictures it is truly a horror show.<br /><br />This film oozes by you supplanting the shock of ghastly images with gentle waves of a wonderful industrial soundtrack that guides you like on slow moving river. Each sequence stands on its own, but in combination you get deeper and deeper into the feeling of overwhelming inevitability. There are few words, this allowing the grandeur in what is shown to preach in its own way. An awful, massive factory filled with human automata who live in hopelessly lifeless dormitories. Individuals dying early while rummaging for recyclable scraps in mountains of our E-waste. The birthing of gigantic ships and their destruction by hand in giant graveyards. The construction of the Three Gorges Dam, the largest industrial project in human history and likely for all time. The time lapse as a city dies and is simultaneously reborn into a replica of modernity that purposefully destroys all relics of the culture that was.<br /><br />The most terrifying image for me was a dam engineer explaining that the most important function of the dam was flood control. The shot shifts to the orchard behind the spokesperson where you witness the level of the last flood by the toxic water having eaten the bark from the trees, demonstrating that nothing but the most hideous vermin could be living in the waters.<br /><br />The obvious not being stated is far more powerful than your normal preachy Save the Earth documentaries. The artist Edward Burtynsky explains the method wonderfully. 'By not saying what you should see  many people today sit in an uncomfortable spot where you don't necessarily want to give up what we have but we realize what we're doing is creating problems that run deep. It is not a simple right or wrong. It needs a whole new way of thinking'. The subtlety of this descends into an either/or proposition, but the film images scream that the decision has very much been made in favor of the dark side.<br /><br />Though never stated directly in any way, as the waves of what you witness wash away from your awareness and you contemplate, there is only one conclusion possible  we are doomed. The progress of mankind that is inexorable from our natures leaves behind carnage that this artist finds terrifying beauty in. What he is actually capturing are the tracks of we the lemmings rushing unconsciously toward our own demise. Unlike most films with environmental themes, this one ends with no call to arms. It argues basically what's the point, but makes certain you place the blame properly on all of us equally.",positive

There was the potential for a good story in there, but Marvel wildly overpowered the titular character, meaning that it never felt like there were any stakes in her conflicts. The big twist kind of worked, but once you know it, there is zero rewatchability. Comfortably the worst movie in the franchise.",negative
"This film, Blade Master, may be cheap, clumsy in appearance and it is sometimes, but it shares thoughts on problems that are way beyond the era this film is set in.

He goes through obstacles as a witful character who is just more than muscle power, although he has quite is lot. I would say this aspect of the movie makes it surpass a film like Conan the barbarian, which is the least I can say, quite brainless. It doesn't diminish in any ways the great adventure movie that is Conan, but it gives Ator his wholesomeness that he shares not with the barbarian. For a lower budget movie, this film does good in terms of setting and the fights are most of the time believable. Zor, the villain, has with is prisoner throughout the film one of the most interesting psychological confrontation that gives tension to the movie, even if Ator seems way too fit for the task to loose. <br /><br />What gives this movie that little extra are those scenes that may look quirky, but worth of mention. The fight with the serpent god, even though he is a gigantic puppet, is well handled as the snake, with good lightnings, remains a silhouette and the fight is quite convincing. The movie climaxes in a most unusual way, quite anachronic, but breathtaking : the deltaplane sequence. The scene itself is not introduced properly, read not at all, where did Ator get that machine, it's pretty unconvincing, but it leads to a really poetic and beautiful midair sequence, that standalone, is the culminating point in the movie, elevating Ator in a place where few human fantasy heroes have been. <br /><br />If Blade Master is not among the great fantastic movies of all time is no surprise due to its lacks, it's a bigger surprise, considering the philosophical way it chooses on the confrontation between good and evil, the truth it speaks and the heart it shows, that this movie is so unwlecomed. I suggest it for every fan of the genre and try take it seriously as an intelligent movie that's to be taken more seriously than it seems.",positive

"I usually find myself at every superhero movie, because I'm a huge superhero fan! However; this wasn't the spectacular marvel movie I was hoping it'd be. Everything from the beginning to the middle was how should I say... Boring... As I said, I'm a huge superhero fan (comics included), and I felt the Carol Danvers that we get from the comics just wasn't the charismatic lady I was hoping for. Every mcu main character had a presence in their movies that made me enjoy every scene they were in, but Brie Larson was just so monotone in this movie. The movie was just disappointing. Hopefully if they bounce back with a sequel that has more depth and emotion. Also I know we live in a culture where everything is PC, but if you want a strong lead woman then watch Wonder Woman because that's how you make a strong lead woman.

"I'm going to break it to you straight, I was part of the mob mentality of hating on this movie, but then my grandfathers advice kicked in ""never be part of a mob"", why? Because once you get caught up in a mob you open yourself up to being influenced, and needlessly hating will tear communities apart. I looked into the comics and what I discovered was baffling, Captain Marvel in one of her stories acts as a criticism against pre-emptive strikes and the negative effects they have on society.. Which is exactly what I was seeing in this mob mentality.nnI'll get into the movie now.nn(Spoiler-ish)nnDo you need to watch this before Endgame? No.nnIs there Universe shattering plot points. No, unless you have established head-canon.nnDoes Carol Danvers look bored all the time? No, she's got a full range of emotions though the movie gives her reason to show restraint.nnIs Carol Danvers a douche or a bully a lot of the time? No, she didn't particularly come off as douche-like to me.nnIs this movie feminist propaganda? No, there's two scenes that collectively amount to about 10 seconds, they're throw-away scenes, they come towards the end of the movie, one of them is a joke, I wouldn't take them seriously though they kinda do take you out of the story for a second.nnDoes the movie have bad pacing? Sort of, there's a couple of moments where Carol Danvers feels a bit too stoic, the reason for this isn't clear, I doubt that it's Brie Larsons fault because some of the opening shots have some extremely nuanced acting and is almost beautifully Ghost In The Shell inspired.nnIs Captain Marvel Overpowered? No, though by the end she comes across as equally powerful as the original Avengers. Also we get to see that she's not used to fighting with her super powers and she makes mistakes while fighting. nnIs Captain Marvel a flawed character? Yes, but it's difficult to see this because the movie doesn't emphasise them too well, they're there, but I think a general audience would have preferred these flaws be more pronounced.nnIs the story good and the pacing? This story is certainly unique from the rest of the MCU movies and when it comes to both story and pacing there are some really good scenes in here, but again, there are some slow ones that kinda drag on there's not many of them and they're short but they're still present in the movie and as minuscule as they are they impact the story and pacing, also there are some really good and almost beautiful scenes in this movie, there are about four, they are really good and some of the highlights of the MCU but the story does also get a bit dumb at one point though it's sandwiched between two of the best scenes in the movie. It also gets a bit dumb at another point but that also leads into this scene that is absolutely fun.nnOverall is a good movie, it's not bad, I wouldn't blame someone for slipping on it though I recommended getting around to watching it at some point but I also want to say that most of the hate is undeserved.nnIt's about a 7/10 for me and at times I see the potential of an 8/10, I wouldn't argue with someone who says it's a 5/10 for them, that might just be up to personal taste, but it's certainly not a bad movie and it's not a great movie. It's just good. And also fun at times. nnI'm considering seeing it again.",controversial
"i liked this film a lot. it's dark, it's not a bullet-dodging, car-chasing numb your brain action movie. a lot of the characters backgrounds and motivations are kinda vague, leaving the viewer to come to their own conclusions. it's nice to see a movie where the director allows the viewer to make up their own minds.<br /><br />in the end, motivated by love or vengeance, or a desire to repent - he does what he feels is ""right"". 'will god ever forgive us for what we've done?' - it's not a question mortal men can answer - so he does what he feels he has to do, what he's good at, what he's been trained to do.<br /><br />denzel washington is a great actor - i honestly can't think of one bad movie he's done - and he's got a great supporting cast. i would thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone.",positive

"All you need is great house, a babysitter and a phone. Simon West directs this thrilling and chilling remake of the 1979 original. This version is more of a thriller than a horror flick. Emotionally tense with an escalating fear factor. Jill Johnson(Camilla Belle)needs to work off an excessive cell phone bill; she takes on the task of babysitting the two children of Dr. and Mrs. Mandrakis(Derek de Lint and Kate Jennings Grant). The house is a beautiful 1970ish wood and glass masterpiece. Secluded and peaceful. The kids are already in bed, the wind builds and is joined by down-pouring rain. The phone begins ringing, ringing, ringing. The babysitter is soon in a frantic mode of survival in fear of the creepy stranger on the other end of the phone.<br /><br />Belle is great as the innocent, smart and strong teen babysitter. The voice of the stranger on the phone is that of Lance Henriksen, while the physical stranger is played by Tommy Flanagan. Also featured are: Katie Cassidy and Brian Geraghty. Kudos to James Dooley for the atmospheric original music.",positive
"Amazing movie, I really don't understand the hate for it. The beggining is a bit boring, but it's necessary for the story. Highly recommend it, even if you haven't seen the rest of the MCU movies.",positive
"The film began with Wheeler sneaking into the apartment of his girlfriend. Her aunt (Edna May Oliver--a person too talented for this film) didn't like Wheeler--a sentiment I can easily relate to. The aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from Wheeler. They left and Wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king. At about the same time, Woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and he was made king. So when Wheeler arrived, it was up to the boys to fight it out, but they refused because they are already friends--which greatly disappointed the people, as killing and replacing kings is a national pastime.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of comedy from the Golden Age of Hollywood--the silent era through the 1940s. I have seen and reviewed hundreds, if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films I have never been able to understand the appeal of Wheeler and Woolsey--the only comedy team that might be as bad as the Ritz Brothers! Despite being very successful in their short careers in Hollywood (cut short due to the early death of Robert Woolsey), I can't help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better. For example, there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the Marx Brother's film, DUCK SOUP, yet CRACKED NUTS never made me laugh and DUCK SOUP was a silly and highly enjoyable romp. At times, Woolsey talked a bit like Groucho, but his jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny! In fact, he just seemed to prattle pointlessly. His only funny quality was that he looked goofy--surely not enough reason to put him on film. Additionally, Wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheese--a piece of cheese that sang very poorly! A missed opportunity was the old Vaudeville routine later popularized by Abbott and Costello as ""who's on first"" which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit or timing. In fact, soon after they started their spiel, they just ended the routine--so prematurely that you are left frustrated. I knew that ""who's on first"" had been around for many years and used by many teams, but I really wanted to see Wheeler and Woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twist.<br /><br />Once again, I have found yet another sub-par film by this duo. While I must admit that I liked a few of their films mildly (such as SILLY BILLIES and THE RAINMAKERS--which I actually gave 6's to on IMDb), this one was a major endurance test to complete--something that I find happens all too often when I view the films of Wheeler and Woolsey. Where was all the humor?!",negative
"Endless pandering ruined what should have been a great movie. One would think companies would realize people just want to enjoy whatever media they spent money to see, but that's not the case here! Larson was blah in the movie, and you'll end up caring more about the side characters. Her various comments prior to release, regarding the movie and just in general, will leave you debating seeing this at all, but if you do prepare for all the pandering your little heart can handle. This is not Marvel's best, not even remotely.",positive
"Definitely a disappointment if you compare it thor Ragnarok, civil war or avenger 3. The intro and last few minutes were amazing  but the long middle portion felt bland and the side characters didn't have enough screen play to actually care about them. Nick fury cgi is breathtaking, Captain Marvel didn't have her match in the movie, the villains were too under powered and hence we don't know yet if she had any weakness. Maybe in end game we will see if thanos is of any match to her. Overall the movie isn't a break through as I thought it would be.",negative

Not to mention the role it played for young girls on women's international day and the simple yet empowering messages it sent by its simple and not unnecessarily complicated plot, such as promoting inclusivity and unbiased judgement.

"I have nothing to do with the outside politics when reviewing this film. Ant Man and The Wasp and Captain Marvel were to me both bland films.(Ant Man and the wasp having better humour and characters) However Captain Marvel was heavily advertised as a movie that would change everything we knew about the MCU. I didn't have much faith in this movie as the source material never portrayed Carol Danvers as a likable character as she could always the most harsh and militarised person in the room. So for me she would work as a morally ambiguous ""heroine"" who's end justify the means. The movie depicts this overconfident character with all her flaws but never suggests that these are character flaws but rather her strengths.nnTwo of the reasons the MCU is successful is that we trust the Marvel Studios to deliver on great character and relationships. This movie jumps from Star force to fury to Maria to Good Skrolls never giving a chance to create a well rounded full character or meaningful relationship. The second reason is that we have the layout for storylines thanks to the comics which are famous and beloved a reason or in Captain marvel's case: disliked for a reason. The Skrolls kree war is a through line and constant within the Marvel comics with no good sides and villain being war itself. Secret Invasion is one of the most iconic storylines but is now tainted by seeing the meekness of the scrolls and  incompetence of the kree. The story could be done later but the menace of Skrolls is diminished as I'll always think of them of victims with the best comedic moments in Captain Marvel. Captain marvel has been reboot for 6+ times for a reason and that she cannot carry a story by herslef and barely with a team.",negative

"I saw it at a German press screening. Without giving too much away: Most critics really seemed to like it very much. There was even applause afterwards, which is quite unusual for that species. From my point of view and until now, it was the funniest movie of the year. It keeps the charm and wit of the three W+G shorts and it is enlarged with many references to these and other movies. Of course, there are obvious allusions to monster- and werewolf-movies, especially to ""An American Werewolf in London"", ""Jaws"", ""King Kong"" and even to Peter Jackson's ""Braindead""/""Dead Alive"", but also to other genres.<br /><br />Characterization was better done in ""Chicken Run"", but that movie had a complete new ""cast"" where introduction was necessary. Here, you are already able to know the two main characters. So, the new ""Wallace and Gromit""-movie is enjoyed best if you watched (and liked) the shorts already, yet it also works on its own. ""Chicken Run"" had the more convenient, but also more ""storytelling"" plot. Instead, this new Aardman masterpiece keeps that crazier and somehow more ""isolated"" feeling of the W+G shorts. Children should also enjoy it very much, especially because of the sweet rabbits (if you love cute bunnies, this is a must-see for you!!!) and because Gromit has a lot do to and really steals the show (children also love dogs... :-) ). But many jokes are thought for a more adult audience (there are even soft sexual allusions in it). The movie manages, like ""Shrek 1+2"" and ""The Incredibles"", to fulfil high level entertainment for the whole family, with adding a British and at least a little bit darker edge to the humour of American animated movies.<br /><br />The animation is  as expected  superb, and they kept true to the Aardman style because they didn't put in too many digital effects - I realized just a few when it came to Wallace's inventions.<br /><br />Finally, the score works fine in the movie, although one of the main themes definitely is ""borrowed"" by Randy Edelman's ""Dragonheart"" score.<br /><br />The bad thing is: It will probably take another six years from now until we can see a new animated gem from Nick Park & Co.",positive

"The opening scenes with Jude Law and establishing the Kerr felt sort of wooden and confusing, but once this movie got going I was really glad to be along for the ride. I've lost patience with/interest in a number of other superheroes, but there's a freshness to Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel that I really appreciate. Her motivations are strong and clear, her powers are satisfying to watch, and it's nice to have a final battle that doesn't fall on the cliche of a city being destroyed in the crossfire.",negative
"I used to watch this on either HBO or Showtime or Cinemax during the one summer in the mid 90's that my parents subscribed to those channels. I came across it several times in various parts and always found it dark, bizarre and fascinating. I was young then, in my early teens; and now years later after having discovered the great Arliss Howard and being blown away by ""Big Bad Love"" I bought the DVD of ""Wilder Napalm"" and re-watched it with my girlfriend for the first time in many years. I absolutely loved it! I was really impressed and affected by it. There are so many dynamic fluid complexities and cleverness within the camera movements and cinematography; all of which perfectly gel with the intelligent, intense and immediate chemistry between the three leads, their story, the music and all the other actors as well. It's truly ""Cinematic"". I love Arliss Howard's subtle intensity, ambivalent strength and hidden intelligence, I'm a big fan of anything he does; and his interplay with Debra Winger's manic glee (they are of course married) has that magic charming reality to it that goes past the camera. (I wonder if they watch this on wedding anniversaries?.......""Big Bad Love"" should be the next stop for anyone who has not seen it; it's brilliant.) And, Dennis Quaid in full clown make-up, sneakily introduced, angled, hidden and displayed by the shot selection and full bloomed delivery is of the kind of pure dark movie magic you don't see very often. Quaid has always had a sinister quality to him for me anyways, with that huge slit mouth span, hiding behind his flicker eyes lying in wait to unleash itself as either mischievous charm or diabolical weirdness (here as both). Both Howard and Quaid have the insane fire behind the eyes to pull off their wonderful intense internal gunslinger square-offs in darkly cool fashion. In fact the whole film has a darkly cool energy and hip intensity. It's really a fantastic film, put together by intelligence, imagination, agility and chemistry by all parties involved. I really cannot imagine how this got funded, and it looks pretty expensive to me, by such a conventional, imagination-less system, but I thank God films like this slip through the system every once in awhile. In a great way, with all of its day-glo bright carnival colors, hip intelligence, darkly warped truthful humor and enthralling chemistry it reminds me of one of my favorite films of all time: ""Grosse Pointe Blank"".......now that's a compliment in my book!",positive
"I didn't like watching DS9 compared to other Star Treks even Enterprise, but I didn't like Babylon 5, and now I know why. They are the same show. I just read the old news that Paramount stole the idea from the creator of Babylon 5, but they chose not to sue for a reason I don't know or care, but seeing as a Star Trek series is based off another even nerdier show is just to much to bare, now I will condemn anyone who even mentions the DS9 when talking about the series. Original, TNG, and Voyager are my favorites in that order. Before I didn't understand why everyone thinks DS9 is great and I didn't, but know I know. It's also because the captain has a real anger problem, and I hate people that act cool, but freak out, out of no where; and he seems to on every episode.",negative
"It is a Marvel origin movie, like other Marvel origin movies it is pretty good. Nothing amazing or super special, but definitely a good movie and certainly very fun. I would rate it on the Marvel scale around a Doctor Strange or Captain America: The First Avenger and definitely better than an Ant Man and The Wasp or Thor: The Dark World.nI'm very tempted to give it a 5-star rating just because there are so many 1-star ratings from people who have not even seen the movie that only rated it because they don't like Brie Larson's politics which is absolutely ridiculous, but I don't want to rate it higher if it doesn't deserve it. It's just genuinely said that Rotten Tomatoes had to change their rating system because so many trolls were trying to give this movie Horrible ratings before it even came out just because of the main actresses politics. This movie is about Carol Danvers, it is not about Brie Larson it has nothing to do with her life so why would you care about her politics? People need to learn to separate the character from the actor. Unless Brie Larson was some form of criminal there is absolutely no reason to not see this movie Just because she is in it and she is definitely a very talented actress, there's a reason she won an Oscar, people.nTl;DR: Good, not amazing, Marvel movie that sets up Endgame very well and is on the higher end of the origin movies. Also, don't let your politics or the actresses politics affect your enjoyment of a movie about a woman that became a super human and can fly through space, shoot beams out of her hands, and basically go Super Saiyan. If you somehow can't enjoy this movie because of her politics then you are going to have a tough time watching any movie that exists ever made after 2000.",controversial

"We should all congratulate Uwe Boll. He's done the unthinkable. He may be the only director to have two movies in the bottom 100 on IMDb! He's like some kind of cinematic cockroach. No matter how little talent he has, and no matter how bad these movies are, he manages to keep making them. I know, he finances them all himself through some kind of bizarre German fund, but even so, his ability to keep making movies despite absolute, complete failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe.<br /><br />It wouldn't be so bad except that video game developers keep giving their best properties to this guy. I really enjoyed the Alone in the Dark series of games. Even the latest one, the New Nightmare, was good for a few hours of game play. There was a good movie to be made out of Edward Carnby's adventures, but this is not it. Now Uwe Boll has gotten his hands on Bloodrayne and Hunter: the Reckoning. What's next, Silent Hill? Doom? I can only imagine the swath that this guy is going to cut through game-to-movie adaptations if he's not stopped. Someone needs to take away his line of credit, or these video game publishers need to wise up and realize that when they make a bad movie out of a game that kills the franchise, no one is interested in that title any more.<br /><br />Think about it, is House of the Dead or Alone in the Dark a viable game title anymore? No way. A new House of the Dead game comes out for X-Box and nobody's gonna care. The title is dead, and all because of Uwe Boll. So if any of you out there work for a game publisher, or know a game publisher, or have access to a game publisher... please warn them. <br /><br />This movie itself is not even worth reviewing. I can't separate what I didn't like about this pile of dung from the rest of it. Literally, everything about it sucks. The writing, the acting, the music, the CG effects, the editing. I thought that if I waited until it came out on DVD and then rented it with low expectations, I wouldn't be disappointed. Boy, was I wrong. Never underestimate Uwe's ability to turn out a big, steaming pile of BOLL sh*t.",negative

"... for Paris is a moveable feast."" Ernest Hemingway<br /><br />It is impossible to count how many great talents have immortalized Paris in paintings, novels, songs, poems, short but unforgettable quotes, and yes - movies. The celebrated film director Max Ophüls said about Paris, <br /><br />""It offered the shining wet boulevards under the street lights, breakfast in Montmartre with cognac in your glass, coffee and lukewarm brioche, gigolos and prostitutes at night. Everyone in the world has two fatherlands: his own and Paris."" <br /><br />Paris is always associated with love and romance, and ""Paris, Je T'Aime"" which is subtitled ""Petite romances,"" is a collection of short films, often sketches from 18 talented directors from all over the world. In each, we become familiar with one of the City of Light 20 arrondissements and with the Parisians of all ages, genders, colors, and backgrounds who all deal in love in its many variations and stages. In some of the ""petite romances"" we are the witnesses of the unexpected encounters of the strangers that lead to instant interest, closeness, and perhaps relationship: like for Podalydès and Florence Muller in the street of Montmartre in the opening film or for Cyril Descours and Leïla Bekhti as a white boy and a Muslim girl whose cross-cultural romance directed by Gurinder Chadha begins on Quais de Seine. I would include into this category the humorous short film by Gus Van Sant. In ""Le Marais"" one boy pours his heart out to another boy confessing of sudden unexpected closeness, asking permission to call - never realizing that the object of his interest does not understand French.<br /><br />Some of the vignettes are poignant and even dark. In Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas' Loin du 16ème, Catalina Sandino Mareno (amazing Oscar nominated debut for Maria full of Grace) is single, working-class mother who has to work as a nanny in a wealthy neighborhood to pay for daycare where she drops her baby every morning before she goes to work. One of most memorable and truly heartbreaking films is ""Place des Fêtes"" by Oliver Schmitz. Aïssa Maïga and Seydou Boro co-star as two young people for who love could have happened. There were the promises of it but it was cut short due to hatred and intolerance that are present everywhere, and the City of Love and Light is no exception. Another one that really got to me was ""Bastille"", written and directed by Isabel Coixet, starring Sergio Castellitto, Miranda Richardson, and Leonor Watling. Castellitto has fallen out of love with his wife, Richardson but when he is ready to leave with the beautiful mistress, the devastating news from his wife's doctor arrives...<br /><br />I can go on reflecting on all 18 small gems. I like some of them very much. The others felt weak and perhaps will be forgotten soon but overall, I am very glad that I bought the DVD and I know that I will return to my favorite films again and again. They are ""Place des Fêtes"" that I've mentioned already, ""Père-Lachaise"" directed by Wes Craven that involves the ghost of one of the wittiest and cleverest men ever, Oscar Wilde (Alexander Payne, the director of ""Sideways"") who would save one troubled relationship. Payne also directed ""14th Arrondissement"" in which a lonely middle-aged post-worker from Denver, CO explores the city on her own providing the voice over in French with the heavy accent. Payne's entry is one of the most moving and along with hilarious ""Tuileries"" by Joel and Ethan Coen with (who else? :)) Steve Buschemi is my absolute favorite. In both shorts, American tourists sit on the benches (Margo in the park, and Steve in Paris Metro after visiting Louvers) observing the life around them with the different results. While Margo may say, ""My feeling's sad and light; my sorrow is bright..."" Steve's character will find out that sometimes, even the most comprehensive and useful tourist guide would not help a tourist avoiding doing the wrong things in a foreign country.",positive

"Bring a box of Kleenex to this funny, engaging, and moving weeper. The two leading actors give tour de force performances - there was considerable debate afterward about whether they are really disabled (they are not.) I appreciated that for once the filmmakers dared to be politically incorrect by depicting people with severe physical disabilities as fully developed people, character flaws and all. As a result, their believability engages us and makes us grow to like them and care about their conflicts. The story structure is formulaic, and many of the secondary characters are merely types, but the two central characters are so riveting that it doesn't matter. <br /><br />Interesting - the original title, INSIDE I'M DANCING, reflects the viewpoint of the character Michael, while the new title for USA release suggests that Rory is the central figure.",positive

"I'd never heard of this, then found out it's the man with the deadly lens, which I'd heard of but not seen. Connery's presence drove me to buy it, and it's not good. It wants to be a sort of cross between Dr Strangelove and Mash, but it just isn't that funny, unless you find the name General Wombat (?) funny. It comes across as a flat 70s thriller until the last ten minutes, when it springs to life. There are many, many flat scenes in the Whitehouse between the president and his aides which don't work. It's almost as if the initial cut was too long, and the first half was edited down to get to the whole nuclear bomb ransom storyline and the suicide bomber attacks, which i think are meant to be played for laughs, but again, aren't that funny. The location filming is excellent but the studio stuff looks like cheap TV. I could not believe the man responsible for Key Largo, Crossfire and Elmer Gantry did this. Only laugh: Connery throws away his wig before putting on his helmet and jumping out of a plane. It makes Never say Never again look like genius.",negative

"A fantastic cinema experience. I really enjoyed seeing this truly magnificent film in the theater when it came out. There is nothing to add, except that is a terrible shame that sir Albert Finney still isn't accepted by the AMPAS (American Academy). After roles in such films as Tom Jones, Murder on the Orient Express, Under the Volcano (to name only few - for these he was nominated for the Oscar), The Dresser is arguably his highlight, yet...<br /><br />I know, Oscars are just popularity contest, but if Americans like British actors and actresses (""and the Oscar goes to"" Jeremy Irons, Daniel Day-Lewis, Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson, Glenda Jackson etc. - and they all deserved the award!), why they always left sir Finney with empty hands?<br /><br />On the other hand, they gave it to John Wayne and Marisa Tomei (in Cousin Vinny). I don't know, should I laugh or cry.<br /><br />If you have seen the two leads in The Dresser, you won't forget what is the art of acting. Watch this film and enjoy! I recommend it to everyone who loves art.<br /><br />I give 9/10 for this excellent film (1 point missing for non-cinematic material, after all it is ""just"" a theater)<br /><br />Note: My criteria is much stronger than this on IMDb (10 only for the cinematic masterpiece that should/could last forever).",positive

For instance the name Avenger. nnOnly the visual effects and some action sequences were ok. nnThe main question is Ă˘~why'. Why this movie, why now?

He should finish it.  n-Thor has taken over the Odin force and is now the most powerfull marvel heroes and has serious beef with Thanos (killing all remaining Asgardians on the ship).n-Dr Strange is the master planner.nIt is unclear what Captain Marvel ads to these characters with long running, well prepared story arcs tied in to Thanos.nShe seems to Ă˘~parachuted in'.  nnThe question does have to be asked.

Our family viewed this today. We all enjoyed it and are not sure what the hate is all about. Is it the best Marvel movie?

"""Cement"" is a bad movie about a bad cop (Penn) with a bad attitude and a bad disposition who has a bad guy in a bad way up to his cajones in fast drying concrete.

"Captain Marvel is an enjoyable addition to the MCU, however it also has a lot of issues which cannot be ignored. nnThe film does do well in certain elements. The effects are obviously excellent, especially in the work done to de-age Samuel L Jackson and the prosthetics on the skrulls. Some of the action is also well done such as the opening fight on board the skrull ship and the chase scene involving the train. I also found the twist involving the skrulls to be a welcome addition which was genuinely unexpected for me (a rarity within the film) and overall created a more emotionally investing aspect of narrative which had yet to be successfully introduced.It also hopefully will give some nuance to the skrull race if they are to return as villains at a later stage during a possible secret invasion storyline, presenting both the good and evil aspects of a race and society which is always an interesting exploration. nnBeyond this one plot twist however, the overall film was very predictable in every other sense. Whilst the supporting cast did very well and worked well with Brie Larson with some good chemistry and emotional beats for them which really worked well, (notably Ben Mendelson and Lashana Lynch) the same cannot be said for Captain Marvel herself. She was entertaining alongside some of these more interesting side-characters and provided some nice snarky quips, but beyond this, on her own, she comes across as rather bland and an absolutely missed opportunity. The film sets up the idea right in the opening scene that Carol is Ă˘too emotionalĂ˘? and Jude Law's character states this to be the reason why she will fail, and repeats this notion throughout the entire film. Despite this, Carol finds she has been fighting an unjust war for 6 years, realises her entire life is a lie, realises she lost her previous happy life and had that stolen from her and finds out that her friends are actually her captors, all of which results in not a single genuine emotional moment from her. Giving her an emotional reaction of anger, despair, self-doubt as a reaction to any of these would have made her much more interesting, likeable and memorable and would have made for a far superior narrative.nnThis lack of payoff in her emotions even then extends to the action in the third act in which she could have used these emotions within the final fight. She could have showed her enemies and the audience that her emotions are her strength and put all of her built up pain into that final fight scene, making for a much more impactful third act and could have allowed her to reach the full potential of her powers.nI also understand that given that she is to be the most powerful hero in the MCU so far, it would be difficult to give her a villain who could genuinely go toe to toe with her at full capacity, but there was easily a way to still have an interesting struggle for her to overcome, whilst also demonstrating her power within the final act. For instance, instead of fighting off the Supreme Intelligence first and then fighting her former allies with her full powers, why not have both happen at the same time? This would mean she had to balance fighting a mental and physical battle at the same time, showing her strength in both ways, whilst still putting her at a severe disadvantage to both, justifying her struggle against them. (side note: this would also involve a much more interesting battle with the Supreme Intelligence beyond walking through a blue beam blandly) nnOverall Captain Marvel is an entertaining, yet disappointing addition to the MCU which sports a good supporting cast and story, with a lead who sadly seems to have been written to be as uninteresting and detrimental to the impact of the narrative as possible. Essentially, Captain Marvel would have been a lot better if it weren't for Captain Marvel.nn3/5",negative

"This is a very strange film by director/animator Richard Williams. All who know of William's work know it's a bit off-kilter (if not ingenious) but this one takes the cake.<br /><br />It features two hapless ragdolls who have to save their owner's new French doll from a lustful pirate toy and find themselves at the mercy of several bizarre characters along the way. The strength in this movie lies primarily in its aesthetic quality; its strange character designs, its powerful animation, and its stark contrast of the sweet and scary. Williams' brilliant animation portrayed Raggedy Ann and Andy as real rag dolls, floppy and darned, rather than simple cartoon versions of the dolls, which made it more believable (at least in a visual sense). The animation shines on the bring us the Camel-with-the-Wrinkled-Knees, whose body walks with two different personalities controlling each end, the silent-movie chase with Sir Leonard Looney and, of course, the Greedy.<br /><br />The Greedy animation, on its own, is possibly the most exquisite psychedelic animation I've ever seen. There's something about this animation that just makes your jaw drop--and every second it's something new. Living in what was deemed ""the Taffy Pit,"" the Greedy is a massive blob man that lives in and mercilessly eats sweets. He sings a song that I can't help but feel hold some sexual undertones, then tries to kill Raggedy Ann for her candy heart.<br /><br />The only complaint I have about this film is that there are too many songs. It continuously bogs down the movie's pace because there are SIXTEEN of them. There are about six good songs (which should have been the only ones) including ""I Look, And What Do I See?"", ""No Girl's Toy"", ""Blue"" (though they didn't need to make him sing it twice), ""I Never Get Enough"", ""Because I Love You"" and maybe ""I'm Home.""

Though Larson puts all her effort into her performance, I didn't like her character as it had zero charisma. A friends reunion in the 2nd half of the movie didn't pack any emotional punch or me. Samuel Jackson is great as a younger Nick Fury but his character doesn't have much to do in the movie. One of the worst flaws- the fight sequences are not up to the mark,there's a scene where it's so dark and you can barely recognize the characters. Overall, I didn't enjoy this movie at all. Lack of proper characterization for Carol Danvers( Brie Larson), bad fight and action sequences, sloppy narration make Captain Marvel a bland movie.",negative
"I guess by the time I saw this episode, I had seen enough Twilight Zones to have it figured out ahead of time. There is this odd assemblage of characters who find themselves at the bottom of a cylinder. They are fine until an overzealous soldier shows up in their midst. It is his prime directive to escape and so he garners the forces and puts them to work to reach the top of the cylinder. There is much discussion about purpose and reason and speculation on their pasts, but no one can remember anything. They represent different jobs: a piper, a ballerina, a clown, a man in a tattered hat. Why are they there? It leads to an adventure and is resolved at the end, but I guess I had a pretty good idea before it all happened.",positive

"This film makes you really appreciate the invention of the fast forward button on your remote control. It's exquisite boredom in beautiful pictures. For once Hamilton goes relatively easy on soft focus shots. However, what I found hard to take about the film was that although Anja Schüte was about 19 when it was shot the girls are portrayed as much younger than they actually are. This whole Lolita thing especially as there is an older man involved leaves me rather uneasy. The heroine is actually shaved in the pubic area in order to make her look even younger than she is. Come on, sex is a nice past time- between consenting adults. Another thing I found odd was that neither Beart nor Schüte have a nude scene in the film, well, not a proper one at least.",negative
"How this movie escaped the wrath of MST3K I'll never know. ""Gymkata"" is a ridiculous action movie, filled (or is that empty?) with paper-thin plots, dumb characters, and preposterous situations. But take it from me, if you enjoy watching poor, yet goofy, movies, you will enjoy ""Gymkata"" a great deal.<br /><br />The action centers around a gymnast who is chosen by government agents (at least I think they were government agents) to become a spy. You see his dad was another quasi-government agent, who has gone missing competing in this game, called, eloquently, ""The Game."" So the gymnast (played blandly by Kurt Thomas) trains to compete in this game and find out what happened to his lost dad.<br /><br />Sounds promising doesn't it? Okay, so it doesn't but still, that bare bones plot sypnopsis doesn't begin to describe the joys of this movie. They can be found in the movie's strange details. Like the gymnast's mysterious Asian girlfriend, who doesn't speak for the first half hour of the movie, then all of a sudden begins to talk, and doesn't shut up for the rest of the time! Or the really tough shirtless bad guy who likes to make and break ""The Game""'s non-existent rules whenever he so pleases. And of course there's our hero's delightful romp through the ""Village of The Crazies"" (Evidently that's the place's real name!). Nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there.<br /><br />But where this movie really shines is the action scenes. Since our protagonist is a gymnast, the director thought it wise to stick gymnastic equipment into the back alleys and town squares of Middle Eastern cities, so that our Gymkata master would be better able to use his gymnast skills to fight the scourge of evil on parallel bars and pummel horses. It has to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />One interesting thing of note. A lot, I'd say about half the cast, dies from being shot with an arrow. Interesting because the arrows are the only believable effects or action in the entire movie. If these were indeed effects, my one major note of compliment to whoever devised these very realistic arrows wounds. More likely, this was the film's way of not paying extras. Nevertheless, ""Gymkata"" deserves a look if you can see it without paying and are looking for some silliness that is an easy target for riffing.<br /><br />",negative
This is definitely one of the best Kung fu movies in the history of Cinema.

However, don't expect this to be a movie about the revolution, it's political stance is wonderfully ambiguous. Many references to the directors obvious love of film history (a great ""Bicycle Thief"" homage"") and some whimsical scenes which work with out being pretentious.<br /><br />Enjoy!",positive
"Let me start off by saying that I went into the theatre with pretty low expectations. I've never been a big fan of (Carol Danvers) Captain / Ms. Marvel, and I assumed there would be too much catching up to do prior to her inclusion in Avengers: Endgame for this to be a cohesive story.nI also made the mistake of being baited (somewhat) into the negativity surrounding this movie. Similar to how some people attempted to sabotage the release of Black Panther, either for loyalty to a rival comic universe or racism, Captain Marvel carries similarly sexist naysayers fueled by Brie Larson's comments regarding previous projects, personal beliefs and preferences or desires regarding members of the press. I foolishly bought into what some of these internet trolls were saying and as previously stated, didn't have high hopes for this movie. But, I've seen every MCU release to date, so I was going to see this one anyway.nnBrie Larson totally won me over in her portrayal of Carol Danvers. As has been typical of Marvel Studios, they made the perfect casting choice and I felt pretty foolish leaving the theatre for thinking that somehow Marvel would screw up an adaptation of their own material. This was a fantastic movie.nnTop notch performances from Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, Jude Law and Ben Mendelsohn. Awesome special effects, cinematography, and screenplay. Brilliantly directed and honestly, the only complaint I have is with some of the fight scene choreography.nnIf you like Marvel movies, you'll like this one, too.",controversial

"This almost documentary look at an enterprising boy who lives in the body shop area outside of New York is real all the way. Real lighting. Real sound. Less editing in the whole movie than in 1 minute of most movies. And while there is very little script, there is a story. Shot in primary colors, almost all red, white, blue and yellow, we get a real sense of the life of a boy who is making something from nothing. He has a place to live that he makes his own, has a good job, and is trying to bring his sister into his little universe. The people in the chop shop area also give us a look at this culture which I didn't know about. They mostly seem decent and pay Ale what seems like daily, seeming truly concerned about his well being. The actor (I think) playing Ale says more with one facial expression than one can imagine. This reminded me what a true small movie can accomplish. It shows what kids are capable of, even without much support and love. Definitely recommend.",positive
"Nothing about this movie is any good. It's a formulaic predictable ""romantic comedy"" geared to make females force their significant others to watch.

"I first saw the film when it landed on US cable a year after it came out. It blew my little head away, I was only 16 and it was the first new wave music I'd heard, having been a strictly folky, classical kid growing up. The music mesmerized me, as did Hazel O'Connor's amazing look and charismatic vocal performances, and Phil Daniels' tough but soft Cockney manager just stole my heart. But I think my favorite character was Jonathan Pryce's drugged out sax player. He was so out of place in the band and so harmless and pathetic, he just begged for sympathy. Favorite scenes, the performance when the lights went out, and the love scene on the train.<br /><br />Okay, so the movie isn't the Rose! But it was really excellent for its limited budget and for its portrayal of the Britain of the early 80's, exploding with rebellious youth, looking for a way out of the dole queue. I went to Britain only a couple of years later and found the movie to have been very reflective of the atmosphere I found when I was there.<br /><br />If you get a chance to, see it. It is a great movie, with some wonderful performances, and the music will blow you away.<br /><br />",positive

"This movie is still an all time favorite. Only a pretentious, humorless moron would not enjoy this wonderful film. This movie feels like a slice of warm apple pie topped with french vanilla ice cream! I think this is Cher's best work ever and her most believable performance. Cher has always been blessed with charisma, good looks, and an enviably thin figure. Whether you like her singing or not - who else sounds like Cher? Cher has definitely made her mark in the entertainment industry and will be remembered long after others have come and gone. She is one of the most unique artists out there. It's funny, because who would have thought of Cher as such a naturally gifted actress? She is heads above the so-called movie ""stars"" of today. Cher is a real actor on the same level as Debra Winger, Alfre Woodard, Holly Hunter, Angela Bassett and a few others, in that she never seems to be ""acting,"" she really becomes the character convincingly. She has more than earned the respect of her peers and of the movie-going public.<br /><br />Everything about Moonstruck is wonderful - the characters, the scenery, the dialog, the food. I never get tired of watching this movie.<br /><br />Every time single time I watch the scene where they are all sitting around the dinner table at Rose's house, I pause the remote to see exactly what delicious food Rose is serving. I saw the spaghetti, mushrooms (I think), but I can't make out whether they are eating ravioli, ziti? What is that main course? It looks wonderful and its driving me nuts! <br /><br />Everybody in that family was a hardworking individual and they respected and cared about one another. The grandfather wasn't pushed aside and tolerated, he was a vital part of the family and he was listened to and respected for his age and wisdom. He seemed to be a pretty healthy, independent old codger too.<br /><br />Loretta's mom wasn't ""just a housewife,"" she was the glue that held the family together and was a model example of what a wife, mother, and home manager should aspire to be. She was proud of the lifestyle she had chosen but she didn't let it define who she was. High powered businessmen aren't as comfortable in their skin as Rose Casterini was. Notice the saucy way she said ""I didn't have kids until after I was 37. It ain't over 'til its over."" You got the sense that she had been the type of young woman who did exactly as she pleased and got her way without the other person realizing what had happened. She was charming, quick witted, and very smart. What a great mom! <br /><br />I didn't actually like Loretta right away because she seemed like a bit of a know--it-all who wasn't really as adventurous and as in control of herself as she wanted others to think. She could tell others about themselves and where they had gone wrong, but she really didn't apply common sense to her own life. She was going to marry a middle-aged mama's boy simply because she wanted a husband and a sense of identity and purpose to her life. She was more conventional than her own mom. She dressed and wore her hair like a matron at a house of detention and seemed humorless and bored, but underneath you sensed that she was vulnerable and lonely and had a lot of love to give the right man. She would probably end up making an awesome mom too.<br /><br />I could see in the future, a house full of Loretta and Ronnie's loud, screaming happy kids and Rose and Cosmo enjoying every minute of it.",positive

"Probably the worst MCU film baring the incredible hulk, the main character only has one emotion and that is snarky, its really insulting to women, this was supposed to be the great women's champion movie but it really falls flat with the main character, she has no flaws or anything that makes her human. If you are a feminist you will be disappointed in how insulting this is to women's intelligence. if you are a marvel fan you should be scared because it likely that she will ruin the new avengers movie. she is too powerful, you dont even know the main characters name until maybe 30 minuets into the film. the story is only just passable but really lacking compared to previous MCU films. the best part of this film is Nick Fury and the only positive part of this film, samuel jackson is amazing as always and keeps this from a zero star film. the visual effects are pleasant but every action film for the last 10 years has been great so this really ins't a bonus anymore. the sound track is dull except when they reuse the avengers theme and the direction is confusing but tolerable. this film could have been so much more, if marvel had just made a black widow film i feel all my issues with the film would have been alleviated, black widow is a balanced,interesting and well thought out character played by a great actor, the opposite of captain marvel. Brie Larson is a good actress, she could have been much better if the story and confusing direction allowed it. do not watch this movie and pray that captain marvel has an extremely small part to play in the new avengers movie.",controversial

The film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme. Rarely have I been so happy to see the end credits of a film. <br /><br />The only thing that prevents me giving this a 1-score is Harvey Keitel - while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort.

"I agree with what so many others have said about the shallow and offensive nature of this film's examination of racism. It is baffling to me that so many people seem to have been fooled by its pretentiousness. I want to comment on the Matt Dillon character as an example of what's most infuriating about this movie. Here we have a man who -- contrasted with the film's underlying message that ""we're all a LITTLE racist"" -- effectively rapes a woman in public, cruelly humiliating her husband and deliberately goading him to make a move that, as he well knows, will lead to his arrest or even death. He does all this after pulling the couple over without any legal cause but because, as we come to understand, they are black and wealthy and he is a hurt little boy who is now the police and can therefore do as he pleases. This behavior is not a LITTLE racist. This behavior is evil. It is disturbing to me that this extreme of racism is held up next to another character's behavior -- spouting her paranoid stereotypes about gang violence -- to illustrate that everybody's a LITTLE racist. Later, we're spoon-fed some tripe about Dillon's poor old dad and how black folks drove him into the poor house. Is this supposed to explain, or worse, excuse this behavior? And is Dillon's character meant to redeem himself by committing the utterly unmotivated and unbelievable, laughably coincidental act of saving the woman he sexually assaulted the very night before? Please. The fact that so many people seem to feel some kind of self-congratulatory admiration for this film makes me feel sad about the shallowness of our understanding of racism, and our apparent lack of commitment to condemning and ending it.",negative

Is this the funniest Marvel movie? No, although Carol Danvers is at her most likeable whilst cracking a joke or yelling back at a screaming enemy in the heat of battle. Is this the coolest Marvel movie? There are cool moments, and each person will take their own take away from it. Is it a good Marvel movie? As a Marvel fan, who came to the party late but caught The Avengers in the cinema on the weekend of release but waited for Ant Man and the Wasp to come out on Blu-Ray, I can tell you - yes, this is a very good movie.

"What can I say that hasn't been said about ""The Haunting""? It has everything that would make a great picture. Wonderful sets, moody music, and sound design to die for were all in place. The screenplay, though, sometimes boggles the mind in such a weird, surrealistic way. The entire team must have forgotten to read it through, maybe because they were too busy creating cg effects and building gothic sets to notice how weak the plot was.

"Meh. This was only sort of good. The graphics were well done. Chemistry between Brie and Sam was good, too. Everything else like the plot, narrative, and dialogue was mediocre at best. Captain Marvels personality wasn't any good. She wasn't charismatic nor did I have much intrigue in her emotionally as a character. Plus, you can tell the feminist undertone within the story which didn't work well with the film. It made it seem as if men are misogynistic and that women need to be the boss or something.

Some people see that as bad character development, but I didn't. nnThe CGI/FX are good for the most part, but for a couple scenes in particular (won't say which ones because spoilers), it can get kind of bad. nnI'm a huge Marvel fan, and while this movie isn't my favorite, I still fully enjoyed it and am glad I went. 7.5-8/10",positive

"This is the funniest movie I have ever seen. However, I have laughed harder at plenty of movies. This is because Best In Show's brilliance lies not in slapstick or one-liners, but in sophisticated and layered verbal wit. The improvised dialogue is is so quick that you end up laughing not at each individual joke, but only until after several jokes build on one another, each disarming your senses until the jokes climax and you can't help letting loose.<br /><br />It's a well-shot film, but what makes it extraordinary is the acting. I was impressed on my first viewing, but when I watched it after having learned that virtually every scene is improvised, I was amazed. It was thoroughly enjoyable to see the comedians work off each other, build jokes out of nothing, and completely immerse themselves in their characters.<br /><br />I imagine the golden days of Second City were like this.",positive

"I like action movies. I have a softspot for ""B"" flicks with bad dialogue and wooden acting. So, I've been wracking my brain to come up with one of my guilty pleasures that was worse than this blockbuster. I can't. You'd be hard pressed to put together a bigger piece of cr*p than this Bruce Willis vehicle.<br /><br />Armageddon is the story (and I use that term loosely) of a team of ""Super-Drillers"" flying off to destroy an asteroid before it destroys the Earth. Realistic? Not really. But who cares? It's an action flick. I'm not blasting the premise.<br /><br />Minor spoilers:<br /><br />The movie begins with a couple of scenes designed to introduce the threat and the characters. Bruce Willis is the tough-as-nails leader of the team, and spends his first bit of screen time chasing around Ben Affleck with a gun for the unforgiveable act of sleeping with his daughter. For some reason, that didn't make me laugh. It was forced, like everything in this movie.<br /><br />The team is called in because they're the only people in the whole wide world who can drill the asteroid. Okay, I'm prepared to accept that premise if it gets us to the action - the supposed meat of the movie. More attempts at humor, with each character going out to do some crazy, nutty thing before blast off. Again, lame. Finally, they take off. Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off. They arrive on the rock, and set to work. Would you believe it, nothing works right and everything has a suspenseful countdown!!! Whoah! Ten, nine, eight... one - Oh, surprise surprise we saved the day again!!<br /><br />And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork. When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick. I can only assume they were trying to cover up the gargantuan holes left by the insipid performances by cutting away to a different shot every few seconds (and this from someone raised on MTV - Mr short attention span himself).<br /><br />Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse... wait - there's a manufactured tearjerker ending that was so tacked on it made the rest of the film a virtual Citizen Kane.<br /><br />Summary: The witticisms weren't witty. The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go. The acting was bad. Really bad. Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse. Camerawork - again, bad. (I didn't even mention the dumbest love scene in the history of motion pictures - think animal crackers).<br /><br />Rating: 1 out of 10. (I'm giving a half point for Steve Buscemi, who makes me smile against my will and another half point for the times I was able to look at the lovely Liv Tyler and attempt to ignore her acting performance) This is far and away the worst movie I've gone to see in the theater... ever.",negative

"and generally speaking, you will eventually have to research this little gem. When describing I Changed My Sex, or Glen Or Glenda as it is better known, I must echo the thoughts of Andrew Smith, who so hit the nail on the head when he wrote ""If you haven't seen any of Ed Wood's other movies, this one is a completely bewildering experience. If you have seen any of Ed Wood's movies, this is still completely bewildering"". The film is both hilarious and tragic, yet it moves with a strange rhythm of its own that leaves one in no doubt that its author knows and means every word he is saying during its running length. Wood, bless him, had some of the loftiest ambitions as a director, wanting to promote peace, understanding, and even acceptance, in the 1950s of all times. When Tim Burton recreated a viewing of Glen Or Glenda by studio execs for his biopic, he showed the execs laughing and telling each other that this had to be a put-on. More than fifty years later, there are still people fighting just to be given the kind of respect that the ""normal"" take for granted, so I say it most certainly is not.<br /><br />No, the real comedy in Glen Or Glenda is the sheer ineptitude Wood displays in composing his message. Directors frequently use stock footage when they can find some that suits their purposes, and can be edited to fit with their own footage. Ed Wood used stock footage indiscriminately, and Tim Burton's biopic celebrated the fact with a scene in which Wood as played by Johnny Depp bets that he could make an entire film out of stock footage. Sadly, the real Ed Wood died before he had a chance, but Glen Or Glenda is the closest he ever came. The IMDb states that twenty percent of this sixty-something minute film is stock footage, and it is never difficult to guess which footage. Footage of busy highways, planes flying overhead, poor lightning effects, soldiers doing their thing, they're all used in a haphazard manner, sometimes repeatedly, and they often only have a loose connection to the story Wood is trying to tell. Had Wood been able to sit back and think about what he is trying to do for a while, there is no telling what kind of heights he could have achieved.<br /><br />Wood himself appears in the film as the titular character, a confused transvestite who imagines himself as a woman named Glenda. Aside from the daring manner in which he attempts to make his point, Wood makes one hideous woman. Having found myself out on the fringe of a society that thinks I am ""disabled"" and need to be ""cured"" myself, I honestly found myself hoping for the best outcome for Wood's character. In order to make his point, however, Wood weaves in short stories of two other transvestites. One of them takes the extreme step of enduring a sex change in order to become a woman, the other finds himself so disenfranchised that he fears being arrested again so much he commits suicide. The scary thing about this film is that if you edited out the transvestism and substituted such disenfranchisements as my position on the autistic spectrum or such things as schizophrenia, very little of the film would even need to be changed. That is how little society has learned since Ed Wood was a boy.<br /><br />The other significant personality in Glen Or Glenda is Bela Lugosi, whom Wood shoehorned into the film. Speculation varies upon Wood's motives, but the accepted theory is that Wood wanted to help revive Lugosi's career, and would do anything in order to achieve this. With the exception of taking his time to carefully construct a good film, that is. In Glen Or Glenda, Wood makes usage of Lugosi that was best described in Flying Saucers Over Hollywood as ""bizarre"". Lugosi plays a character billed as The Scientist, but comes off more as an omnipotent puppet master. People who have not seen Ed Wood films before the biopic will think Tim Burton made up the ""beware of the big green dragon that sits on your doorstep"" speech. If anything, Burton was being restrained about which bizarre speech to use in depicting Wood-ian dialogue. Nothing can prepare you for seeing the speeches in their original context, not even Criswell's hilarious ranting during Plan 9 From Outer Space.<br /><br />Observant types will also note the presence of Delores Fuller, Wood's girlfriend at the time. Again, Burton dramatises her reaction to seeing the script for the first time, whereas the film portrays her as being accepting and forward-thinking. I cannot help but feel that Burton's portrayal is more accurate, as Fuller looks extremely uncomfortable in her role. She only appears for about fifteen minutes, but her delivery seems so mechanical, so lifeless, that she somehow manages to seem less talented than her cast-mates, if such a thing is possible. Whether Wood's direction was better-focused in this case than usual is hard to determine, but if the ability of the support cast to leave the stars (with the obvious exception of Bela) in the dust is any guide, then it should come as no surprise that Fuller would only appear in a very small role within one other Wood film. That she went on to write a number of hit songs tells you she made the right decision to stay behind the camera. While Wood would appear before the camera again, it was never as more than a cameo, a walk-on, or a bit-part.<br /><br />I gave Glen Or Glenda a one out of ten. I generally only give this rating to films that are so bad they become entertaining as a result. Bold and well-intentioned as it was, Glen Or Glenda fits that description to a T.",negative

"Intrigued by the synopsis (every gay video these days has a hunk on the cover; this is not necessarily to be construed as a good sign) I purchased BEN AND ARTHUR without knowing a thing about it. This is my second (and I assure you it will be my last) purchase of a CULTURE Q CONNECTION video. As far as I am concerned, this DVD is nothing but a blatant rip-off. I do not make this observation lightly  I am a major collector of videos, gay and mainstream, and I can state with some authority and without hesitation that BEN AND ARTHUR is quite simply the worst film I have ever sat through in my life. Period. My collection boasts over 1,600 films (93% on them on DVD) and of those, well over 300 are gay and lesbian themed. I hardly own every gay movie ever made, but I am comfortable in stating that I pretty much purchase almost every gay video of interest that gets released, and very often I buy videos without knowing anything about the film. Sometimes, this makes for a pleasant surprise - Aimee & Jaguar, It's In The Water, Urbania and Normal are all examples of excellent gay titles that I stumbled upon accidentally. So when I read on the box that BEN AND ARTHUR concerned a conflict between gay lovers and the Christian Right, one of my favorite subjects, I decided to take the plunge sight unseen, despite my previously disappointing purchase of another CULTURE Q CONNECTION title, VISIONS OF SUGAR PLUMS. That film was pretty bad, but compared to BEN AND ARTHUR, it viewed like GONE WITH THE WIND. So what was so wrong with BEN AND ARTHUR? Plenty! To begin with, the ""plot"" such as it was, was totally ridiculous. This film almost made me sympathetic to the Christian Right  we are asked to believe not only that a church would expel a member because his brother is gay, but that a priest would actually set up a mob style execution of a gay couple in order to save their souls (like this even makes sense). The writing is so poor that many scenes make no sense at all, and several plot points reflect no logic, follow-up or connection to the story. Murder and violence seem to be acceptable ends to the gay activist / right wing conflict on both sides, and the acting is so bad that it's difficult to imagine how anybody in this film got hired. The characters who are supposed to be straight are almost without exception clearly gay - and nelly stereotypes to boot; the gay characters are neither sexy nor interesting. This film is enough to put off anybody from buying gay themed videos forever, and the distributors should be ashamed of themselves. The only advantage this picture has over my other CULTURE Q Connection purchase, VISIONS OF SUGARPLAMS, is that this one has a soundtrack with clear dialogue. Hardly a distinction, since the script is so insipid that understanding the script only serves to make you more aware of how bad this film truly is. It is an embarrassment to Queer culture, and I intend to warn everyone I possibly can before they waste their money on it. At $9.95 this film would have been way overpriced; I understand that it's soon to be re-priced under $20, which is STILL highway robbery. I paid the original price of $29.95, and I never felt more cheated in my life. The only true laugh connected with this drivel is the reviews  I have seen ""user reviews"" for this film on numerous websites, and there is always one or two that ""praise"" the director / writer / actor in such a way that it's obvious that the reviewer is a friend of this Ed Wood wannabe. How sad. How desperate. I just wish IMDb would allow you to assign zero stars - or even minus zero. If ever a film deserved it, this is it.",negative

"I don't think a movie like this would be released today. It takes it's time to present the depth of the characters and the plot isn't full of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />But, what this film does have: an interesting study in how families' deal with grief. How when the language for healing and over-coming tremendous loss leaves us mute, and we rely on raw emotions instead. Grief without reason and patience is anger, even hate. And unfortunately, the lead character (a young boy who accidently shoots and kills his brother while hunting) in the film is given more than his fair share of it. He eventually leaves and moves in with his grandfather (Wilford Brimley) who makes it clear to him that it WAS an accident. I got the impression that this young man knew that in his heart, but needed to hear those words from his parents, and to receive their forgiveness.<br /><br />What I loved about this film: the lack of dialog. There was a tremendous emphasis on physical reaction, facial expressions. And the slower pace of the film allows you to really watch the reactions of the actors.

"One reviewer notes that it does not seem to matter what Welles actually says or does, he moves you. I concur. He was and remains a unique force in film. More than a triple threat who could act, write and direct, he had a genius uniquely suited to film. One can consider whether in an earlier age he would have been a painter. This film certainly reinforces that impression. A musician, a theatre actor, an heir to Shakespeare? hard to tell but I am very grateful that his time cam with film and he have him captured on film. I like the accent. I like the face, the size, the style, the mind and the games. I love all of his movies and wish there were more. I particularly love how other actors interacted with him on film. Many were never better or at least somehow different with him because he was o firmly there. Even towards the end when his beauty was ruined, perhaps by his own intent, he was impossible to ignore and he made every scene he was in. Rita was a gorgeous blonde -- a Lana Turner look alike but perhaps even lovelier and even then the eye goes to Welles and one wishes for another minute, another film, another hour in his company. That is why we all wish we could come upon the lost scraps cut from his films because we know, we all know, that there is not part of him not worthy of our time.

"This three-hour Chinese epic, set in 220 B.C., may ultimately amount to a familiar theme of an Emperor's idealistic dream of peace through unification mutating into corrupted isolation, and there's nothing inherently challenging about the film, but it's a compelling narrative, crammed with intrigue and passion and betrayal and epic events told in vivid strokes. Even for those not drawn to such historical spectacles for their own sake, it's an astonishing feast for the eyes: the scene depicting the coup attempt of the Marquis is one of the most staggering evocations of physical space and grandeur in memory, and the battle scenes are memorable both in their scope and their immediacy. The title sums up the film's use of compelling contrasts - huge plainland vistas set against intimate horrors; the noblest of motives set against the most degraded; hope turning to dust. If you've never seen a three-hour Chinese epic, this wouldn't be a bad place to start.",positive

It was very off-putting watching some of her scenes as she would almost mumble through them as if she didn't want to be there. nLastly, the action was not exciting at all.

It is annoyingly filled with the most mind-numbing 90's references that are used mainly for jokes instead of building a truly detailed setting. The film has also strange and underdeveloped villains with an anti-climatic third act. It is one of the MCU's weakest offerings but would be recommended for anybody looking for a slightly entertaining blockbuster. ",positive
"I was worried about all the hate surrounding this movie but it's actually a very good Marvel origin story with solid action and a 90's retro nostalgic flavor. Brie Larson does the job and I can't wait to see her kick Thanos. All the cast is good with of course a terrific Samuel Jackson and a surprising Ben Mendelsohn. To all the anti feminist haters, just get a life and be honest in your review because I'm sure you already hated this movie before seeing it. And when you say it's the worst Marvel ever, go see one more time Thor 2 please. Captain Marvel is not the best Marvel movie ever and not the worst. It fits in all the good ones, with delightful surprises if you pay attention to the details. Highly recommended.",controversial

"when i first read about ""berlin am meer"" i didn't expect much. but i thought with the right people, the right locations, the right music and fashion you could at least make a trivial movie about the hip berlin everyone seems to be talking about. but eissler failed, it's so ridiculously unauthentic. it's a complete misrepresentation of what it is going on in berlin's so called scene. of course it's not all about hippness, but you should expect more from a movie that's being sold as ""the definite berlin movie"".<br /><br />and apart from all the credibility stuff, it really is a bad movie. mediocre acting and a rather boring plot. interestingly some of the actors have proved in other movies that they are actually quite talented. so it really must be poor directing skills.<br /><br />don't bother watching ""berlin am meer"" unless you are 17, come from some small town in western Germany and want to move to the big city after you finished school. then you might actually find it enjoyable and totally cool.",negative

"I get it the Diehl character is s'posed to be a microcosm of America itself - seeing Arab terrorists under every rock, only to find out at the end that it's his own actions all along that got him into that siege state and truly if he practices good-will to all men everything will be rainbows and lollipops. Sorry Wim you have made amazing movies in the past that stay neutral of the politics and for good reason, polemics are your weak point and they weaken this a well-made, amazingly filmed movie with absurd characters, dialog and plotting. Better luck on your next flick. Another thing that yanked my crank was the belabored point of the homeless section of LA being there for reasons of hunger, these people don't get enough to eat. Truly these folks aren't eating regally but the real hunger these folks is a spiritual hunger, an emotional hunger, a mental hunger. They need self-respect, self-worth, dignity which you can't give a man. Yeah those folks are hungry and if they need it it is available. Less the center for hunger in America, I would say it's more the center for alcoholism, drug-abuse, mental suffering and economic devastation. Dealing with hunger although a noble endeavor is band-aiding a more profoundly systematic societal and age-old human problem of homelessness. Bill Diehl was good though and Michelle Williams was cute as the young yet (cliched) old soul.",negative
"It had little impact on me after I saw it. The twists were more or less predictable and the audience doesn't discover them along with the characters, creating a disconnect. There is nothing inherently bad about this, it's still a competently made movie and the acting for the most part is a ok. I wasn't a HUGE fan of Bree Larsons performance. For character who everyone else in the film says needs to control her emotions she doesn't really show any emotions. The movie is bland, but not bad. There are a few laughs here and there, and everything with Nick Fury is great. Once the characters make it to Earth the plot really begins to pick up.",negative

The two most cringe worthy moments are the final confrontation with the supreme intelligence (Nirvana's ""Come as you are"") and the final fight sequence (No Doubt's ""Just a girl"").

The mixture is challenging and intriguing, and the film has many entertaining and clever sequences (like the one where Chaplin and four other guys try to avoid finding a coin that will order their self-sacrifice), but the ingredients don't always click together, and the mix (and tone) seem kind of disharmonious. As for the famous final speech, though undeniably honest, it also seems a bit naive today, with its allusions to ""a better world where man will overcome his hate and brutality, and his soul will fly"".

Griffith offer a good contrast). It should be allowed that Eisenstein was not the only montage theorist and the principles of montage editing would likely have been discovered by another given time. However, even today, few directors have approached the skill with which Eisenstein created meaning through the combination of images at such an early point in the evolution of the medium.<br /><br />If you are not interested in that sort of thing, Potemkin is still one of the most beautiful and moving films ever made.

"I'll make it very simple and clear: Captain Marvel is really not worth a watch. It's just bland and visually unimpressive, exactly what it was meant to be.nnJust keep this in mind that it's an boring origin story so don't go looking for an entertaining story. It's just a mediocre action movie that introduces us to a new superhero Captain Marvel, played horridly by Brie Larson. It became an instant turn off watching her in this action heroine avatar, something she manages to not pull off with ease. Watch her in the action sequences and there's no way you can be impressed. Viewers were literally doing nothing for some of the most heroic moments in the film. Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury is as awesome as always, it's just that his character feels even better and refined than what we've seen. Jude Law is also quite good, and so are Ben Mendelsohn and Lashana Lynch.nnBut the one character that ultimately steals the show is Goose, the cat. Some of the sequences involving her are so OK that it was really difficult to start laughing.nnVisual effects are alright, and the IMAX 3D viewing just made em slightly better. And since it's most importantly an action movie, every single action sequence it delivers is bland, especially the train sequence. I would call it one of the major low point of the movie. Cinematography in certain portions is really unimpressive. Humor, like any other MCU movie, is meh and really manages to make you stare.nnCaptain Marvel has a Green Lantern origin story presented and executed in a bland manner. The directors have done a bad job with the characterization of Captain Marvel, and that is what makes everything in the film seem so mediocre.

"Very disappointing. Visually dynamic, uneven acting, pedestrian storytelling. Ben Mendelshon and Samuel L Jackson are the only bright spots. Bree Larson's talent didn't show on screen.

I, myself, am reading the book that the movie is based off of and it has shown me even more light into this story and answers some questions that were left unanswered in the movie. I'm also to read the Exectioner's Song, which is the 'other' half of the Gilmore story. This movie made me think so much about the phrase ""piering into the other side of the looking glass"". You hear a song in the movie called Gary Gilmore's Eyes, which is by a punk band that wrote a song about what it'd be like to have Gary Gilmore's eyes(which is one of the things Gary gave as a transplant when he died) and as you listen to it, which is after the last time Mikal ever sees Gary, you look at the whole situation a little differently if you were to only here the song itself.

"A deplorable social condition triggers off the catastrophe: An impoverished Giovanna has ended up in the gutter, but still has an ace up her sleeve: beauty and youth. Bragana, a fat-bellied gas station tenant, who has been getting on in years, picks her up from the street and offers her bed and home together with his clumsy affection. But the physical contact that Giovanna is now exposed to only gives her feelings of disgust, and consequently she does not see a benefactor in him but a tormentor whom she has to get rid of.<br /><br />The arrival of Gino, a young migrant worker, finally provides her the longed-for opportunity. And you don't have to ask her twice: At the very first encounter she gives him the feeling of being physically desired, and a little later she lets him seduce her without offering any resistance.<br /><br />The developping partnership has to submit to the strict rules drawn up by Giovanna though. Gino's yearning for freedom is suppressed, his desire to leave the place with Giovanna and start a new life far away from the fatso is pushed aside. Giovanna aims at another goal: to get Bragana killed, to inherit and, in addition to that, to collect the insurance premium. In her hands Gino degenerates into a self-sacrificing tool. Being completely at the mercy of this woman he turns into a cold-blooded killer.<br /><br />But in contrast to Giovanna he questions the committed crime on a moral level. The very taking over of Bragana's place, which includes the sleeping in the bed of a dead man, causes a deep loathing of himself. And later, after he has found out about the forthcoming payment of the insurance money and seems to see through Giovanna's cunningly devised plan, he also executes a physical separation from his lover and finds comfort in the arms of a prostitute.<br /><br />If Visconti's film ended at this point, it could easily be classified as a condemnatory portrait of a cool, calculating and unscrupulous woman with a slight touch of social criticism. But then the last sequences make this carefully built construct of ideas collapse. At last Giovanna feels remorseful about what she has done, and by the uncompromising revelation of her innermost feelings she succeeds in inflaming anew Gino's love. Her violent death by an absurd road accident then does not only leave him helpless at the mercy of an arbitrary fate. It also affects us, while we realize that none of the acting characters is to be made responsible for their disaster. The culprit is just the state of a society that determines the way of the individual unalterably right from the start.<br /><br />",positive

I could see myself in this same predicament - passively allowing things to happen around me, not standing up for the right and decent thing, just trying to avoid trouble. How often do we avoid making waves or sticking our necks out? How often does our inaction condone the evil actions of others. We would never join them, we tell ourselves, we recognize that what they are doing is bad, but do we do anything about it? <br /><br />Lawrence Newman (William H. Macey) is a low-key, nerdy office worker who has paid off his home in Brooklyn, NY in the waning days of World War II. He rarely gets engaged in what is going on around him, has never married, rarely socializes, just goes to work and cares for his invalid mother. Then a series of events in his very ""white"" little neighborhood pull him out of his complacent shell into a maelstrom of events. It starts as he witness from his bedroom window the rape of a Puerto Rican girl by the son of his neighbor. Soon after he gets glasses because of poor vision. As he is now better able to see, he becomes less able to deal with the circumstances of his life. The one bright spot is a new love in his life, and he marries, hoping to continue on in his normalcy. Then the virulent anti-semitism on that street catches him, despite his credentials as a Presbyterian WASP. As things spiral further out of control, he discovers he must make an important decision - does he take a stand or does he simply go away.<br /><br />I cannot how anybody can view this movie without being affected and having to think very much about themselves and what they really stand for.

The only interesting writing was the twist on who is actually the villian.

"There is an inherent problem with commenting or reviewing a film such as this. I remember feeling the same way after disliking Dogma.

Of course for those who have already seen this film you know that the entire point is not getting it anyway.<br /><br />I have heard from several different sources that the unique and likable aspect of this film is a dream-like quality it has. In other words, the plot isn't structured like other films. With the case of Mulholland Dr., it seems more like an unfocused collage made by a third grade boy who procrastinated until the last second to do his art project. It doesn't make sense, it isn't supposed to, but I know it was to be a TV series at first. It appears Lynch had a stack of unused film and decided to mash it in with a bunch of new stuff.

All things he would not have filmed for television.<br /><br />For a better film not told in a traditional, linear fashion, rent The Thin Red Line from 1998. That was a great film, this is not.<br /><br />Rating: 2 out of ten",negative
its good and great movie this is awesome captain Marvel ,positive
"(Spoilers!) Seriously. This is not a good movie. It really does feel forced into the MCU. Winter soldier was awesome. In that movie, Nick Fury says, (something like) â€śLast time I trusted anyone, I lost an eye.â€ť Now that cool aspect to him is reduced to a stupid freaking cat scratching him? The cat isn't even funny! What are people talking about?? Then there's Carol Danvers and the (what's supposed to be) touching moments where she reconnects with her â€śbest friendâ€ť but it feels very insincere and out of place. No emotional connection to these characters whatsoever. I don't know what else to say. Wait until it's on Netflix. I have a feeling it will be added to Netflix this year. đź¤˘",positive
This is another top notch Marvel film. I enjoyed it thoroughly.,positive
"Liked some of the 90's references all though they did feel a little forced at some times. I had a really hard time with the CG as it looked really bad for a 2019 movie and really took me out. Fury was good and was the saving grace for the acting, as Brie was not funny and flat. Her character did not have any depth and I have no interest in seeing more of her. As an MCU film it was the worst I have seen in a long time, honestly it was worse than Thor 2. But might just be me.",negative

"Captain Marvel was hyped to be one of the biggest and best adventures and origin stories in the MCU. However, this film falls disappointingly short. Captain Marvel herself came across as cold and unlikeable for the majority of the film and with her being portrayed as being so powerful it meant anytime she was in danger I never bought into it so never cared about her character. Even Iron Man, Thor, Captain America etc in their origin stories had something which made them vulnerable which made us buy into their characters. The twist was predictable and overall had the feeling of being released for the sake of needing to introduce Captain Marvel before Endgame rather than wanting to make a Captain Marvel film. In all honesty this film does a better job of furthering Fury's character than Captain Marvel. I understand they wanted to produce a female fronted MCU movies, which is great, but being a marvel movie. It will have hype. And if it doesn't live up to that hype then it falls by the wayside. It feels like a side mission rather than part of the main story. I hope in Endgame they are able to make her character gel with the other avengers. Overall, disappointing, predictable story with boring twist, waste of Jude Law and other fantastic actors, good comedy!, Incredible de-aging of Fury and Coulson, great to see Coulson and the Skrull was a welcome change. But unfortunately fell painfully short of the bar it set for itself. Which is a shame",negative
"I'm giving ten out of ten it's one of the best movies ever. Absolutely smashed, stunned and dazed by the whole picture, marvellous playing of Jason Statham, Ray Liotta and all the crew, amazing plot... Just look into yourself and pluck up your courage to admit-it touched your soul, because it's strange, but there are all the answers you've been ever looking for... The very best, mr. Ritchie! THE VERY BEST EVER. Those who were looking for a simple figtings and skirmish keep yelling they are disappointed. But there are lots of shallow movies in Hollywood nowadays, you can't remember what it was about the next day you had seen it. On the contrary, Revolver is unique, I could have hardly expected it's possible to portray such a clear and genius picture of myself, of everyone who was to watch it. Absolutely unsurpassed, astounding, dazzling... One can get insight watching this, I have no doubt about that. Actually, no words can express my admiration... I'm still wondering how it was possible to shoot such a movie after years of giddy Hollywood rubbish we had been watching. Thank you from all heart, it's simply the best.",positive

"This movie is such cheesy goodness.<br /><br />A bunch of people trapped in an abandoned school. They start getting killed off, they know they are being stalked, so what do they do? One girl decides to take a bath, another decides to cheat on her husband (who is also there) with an old boyfriend so they somehow find a bed (in an old abandoned school?) and go at it.<br /><br />And it comes through with the gore and the T&A.<br /><br />And it's also interesting from a historical/sociological point of view. Where the usual 80's slasher is a reflection of how we view ourselves, or how adults view young people, or as Hollywood views the rest of the country this has a unique perspective. This is a Brit film made to be an American slasher. It's hilarious to see how often the British actors who are trying to speak ""American"" unintentionally slip back in to their UK accents.<br /><br />If you like cheesy 80's slashers (like Pieces) then you will like this one.",positive
"My rating reflects how my opinion of the movie on a purely entertainment basis. Shut out the noise regarding Larson's comments and views or any feminist messages portrayed in the film. If you can do that, you will find an entertaining Marvel movie. I may probably watch it again once it becomes available to stream but wouldn't bother seeing it in theaters again or buying it. Larson does an admirable job as the lead, but doesn't feel like she could carry the movie on her own, like RDJ does with Iron Man. However, I think part of that problem could be the writing. That said, the supporting cast does a great job helping balance things out. There are some great action scenes. The movie starts off with a bang, lags a little in the middle, then picks up strong for the climax. It definitely leaves plenty of uncharted territory to explore for this heroine. Overall, Captain Marvel is an uneven experience. Think of the tone as sort of â€śThor Ragnarok - liteâ€ť. But it doesn't have enough action or humor to make up up for the rather bland narrative. I normally walk out of a movie remembering specific scenes that blew me away and draw me back wanting more. The only Captain Marvel scene that fits that bill for me was the mid credits scene. Captain Marvel is enjoyable, but I would consider it middle of the pack compared with other Marvel movies. Not as bad as The Hulk or Thor 2, but far from being as good as GotG 1 and 2 or Infinity War.",controversial
"beginning drags just a bit, and it doesn't do anything different like Black Panther, but the film still hours the mark using the marvel formula. definitely a good movie for young girls as well. Bri Larson does a great job in the second half giving her character complexity",positive
"As a huge fan of Marvel Cinematic Universe who saw previous 20 films multiple times, I was eagerly waiting for Captain Marvel.nOverall, a fun, action packed movie which never stop you from having a good time in theater. But, I was disappointed with how the character Nick Fury was handled. I love The Winter Soldier and one of the best dialogue from that movie was by him about how he lost his eye by trusting someone. Those mysteries behind him made him who he is now and established him as one of the key characters of MCU. nBut the way he lost his eye shown here was upsetting. All the male characters whether alien or human, was forcibly bland and only focused on restraining the females although that's not always the case in reality.nBrie Larson is a great actress. But sometimes, I can't help but notice here she looks rather emotionless, without any expression or whatsoever. Representation of a strong female character can have emotions and flaws, it should. That is how we can relate to them more. Here the overpowered character rather seems alienating, someone young generation can't look up or relate to.",negative
"Fantastic film! We really enjoyed it. Of course the discussion also includes a strong female lead, but Brie carries the movie well and this film will undoubtedly inspire a new generation of young women who will be lucky enough to take movies like this for granted.",positive
"Overall a really good movie, final act fight was a little anti-climatic but other than that a really inspiring film.  I know it was directed more towards women, but even as a white male I found the overcoming adversity angle to be inspiring of what the best in humanity.",positive
"It is an extremely difficult film to watch, particularly as it targets the innermost core of all of our lives. But ultimately it is a very beautiful and deeply moving film. Any person who finds it cynical I have to say that they must have greatly missed the point of the film's entire message. For those who actually watch the film, they will see that the way the issues are dealt with is absolutely necessary, and the outcome is ultimately uplifting. Sure, it's very hard to watch, a difficult subject matter and even brutal. Yet it's extremely relevant to society and everybody. It shows the peak of what world cinema is doing at the moment (I will not restrict that term to just France) and everyone should try to see it. I will say that it is best to go in with a clear head without being swayed by conflicting views, and just let the film work for you.",positive

For me this is a pleasant surprise because I can't tell you how many times I cried when Starsky or Hutch got hurt. The episode where Starsky (Kill Starsky) almost died I cried so hard My dad had to turn away from the show. What to you expect of a kid at age 12. Now, I intentionally look for films and programs involving Paul or David Soul and anything that Stephen King has his hands on I'm so there!!!!!!!! Just got to say Happy birthday Paul!!!!!",positive
"In the small American town of Meadowvale Dr. Anthony Blake (David Gale, the IMDb listing for this character is wrong it's definitely Dr. Blake not Dr. Blakely) is the director and founder of the famed 'Psychological Research Institute' and also host's a local T.V. programme called 'Independent Thinkers'. He uses this T.V. show to hypnotise the viewers and make them commit acts of violence. Dr. Blake has the help of a large brain with an evil face that uses it's spinal cord as a tail thingy. Usually the brain is just sitting in a tank, eats mice and the odd bad actor, each time it eats someone it gets much bigger. Meanwhile at the local high-school gifted but troublesome teenager Jim Majelewski (Tom Bresnahan) has been caught putting Sodium down the toilets. Jim is sent to Dr. Blake at the PRI for help with his attitude and behavioural problems. While there Dr. Blake hooks Jim up to, well something I'm not actually sure what. This whatever it is, is attached to the brain. At first Jim is able to resist the brain's mind control. The brain feels that Jim is a threat to itself and it's plans. Once out of the PRI Jim starts having bizarre hallucinations and crashes his car. Jim makes it to his waitress girlfriend Janet (Cynthia Preston as Cyndy Preston) but is handed back to Dr. Blake's assistant Verna (George Buza) soon after by Officer Marks (Harry Booker). The brain wants to kill Jim because he is the only one capable of withstanding it's mind control techniques, and with 'Independent Thinkers' going national the brain doesn't want anything or anyone to stop it's evil plan for world domination! Jim quickly realises that the brain is controlling the entire town and he alone must stop the brain, before it takes over the world!<br /><br />Directed by Ed Hunt who calls himself Edward Hunt here, the Brain wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Don't get me wrong as it certainly isn't great either. The script by Barry Pearson tries a stab at satire with the brain washing and mind control by T.V. storyline. It moves along at a fair pace and isn't too boring. No explanation is given for the existence of the brain at all, it's just there and that's it we have to accept it. The story is a little choppy and never fully explores one single element, there's the T.V. mind control, the brain itself, Jim being hunted by the police & his misbehaviour and various other little bits and pieces here and there including a bizarre revelation regarding Dr. Blake that isn't explained at all. Production wise this film looks cheap, and probably was cheap. The acting isn't great but I've seen worse, and what is David Gale doing in this? In fact this role is similar to Gale's role in Re-Animator (1985) even down to his character's deaths in both films. The brain itself at first sits in a tank and starts to grow whenever it eats someone and by the end it is pretty big. Each stage is just made of rubber. It doesn't look particularly good and isn't scary or creepy, just cheap. There's no blood or gore in it apart from a blink and you'll miss it decapitation. The nudity is provided by Dr. Blake's assistant Vivian (Christine Kossak as Christine Kossack) before she gets eaten. The brain had a certain entertainment value for me but I would think most people would dislike it. Maybe worth a watch if you can see it on T.V. for free.",negative

"I liked House of Dracula much more than house of Frankenstein. Carradine is much more passable & his acting isn't as ridiculous & overboard as in HOF. The actors deliver solid enough performances. The subplots (eg the monster, the village mobsters, the village idiot, the hunchback nurse etc ) are mixed in well, so that none becomes an odd splinter as in HOF. Better run than the stitched-together HOF. The hunchback nurse is as likable as the hunchback in HOF. The doctor is very good. As well, Lon Chaney adds a classy touch with his wolfman. Worth watching twice. A classic universal horror with that typical 1940's, long lost flair. Especially good is the doctor's performance before/after his blood had been contaminated with Dracula's.",positive
"Rather foolish attempt at a Hitchcock-type mystery-thriller, improbably exchanging espionage for archaeology and based on the Robin Cook novel; incidentally, I’ve recently acquired another adaptation of his work – COMA (1978) – in honor of the late Richard Widmark. For the record, director Schaffner had just made THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL (1978) – a similarly fanciful but much more engrossing suspenser and, unfortunately, SPHINX was a false step from which his so-far impressive career would not recover.<br /><br />Despite its scope and reasonably decent cast, however, this one proved a critical and commercial flop – mainly because the narrative just isn’t very thrilling: in fact, it’s quite dreary (feeble attempts at horror – the archaeologist heroine having to put up with entombment, rotting corpses galore, and even an attack by a flurry of bats – notwithstanding). Lesley Anne-Down is the lovely leading lady, stumbling upon a lost treasure – it’s actually been hidden away by a local sect to prevent it from falling into the hands of foreigners, who have appropriated much of the country’s heritage (under the pretext of culture) for far too long. Sir John Gielgud turns up in a thankless bit early on as the antique dealer who puts Down on the way of the loot, and pays for this ‘act of treason’ with his life.<br /><br />Typically, it transpires that some characters are the opposite of what they claim to be – so that apparent allies (such as Maurice Ronet) are eventually exposed as villains, while an ambiguous figure (Frank Langella, whom I saw at London in early 2007 in a West End performance of “Frost/Nixon”, which has now been turned into a film) goes from Down’s antagonist to her lover and back again, as he determines to keep the wealth belonging to Egyptian high priest Menephta a national treasure.",negative

I even knew from the beginning that he was going to die in the end, the only thing I didn't know was how. Too politically correct. Very disappointing. The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful. But, if you want that, watch National geographic.

"The film is not for everyone. Some might think the acting is bad when it is actually understated and natural. There are no obviously evil acts and there are no stunningly beautiful moments. There is a lot of indecision, an lot of conflicting feelings.<br /><br />Actually this film takes a very honest look at a very complex subject, Sex with minors. It is complex because the characters are trying to deal with love and sex when her body and hormones are still developing and both of their minds and personalities are still developing. Complex also because society has very simplistic views of sex with minors, and complex, because the characters don't know if society is right or if their instincts are right.<br /><br />Some will not like the movie because it leaves unanswered questions. Questions such as who was really in charge of the relationship, who was damaged, did good come out of it, was it art, who was damaged more, did some of the problems with their relationship stem from it being forbidden by society, did some of the problems stem from their own immaturity, and probably most important, was this truly a crime?<br /><br />The film is resolutely neutral on all of this, and it is this neutrality that is its strength. It is the reason for the understated acting, the simple sets, the lack of background music, soft lighting, and the general ""flat"" presentation. The message is clear. We don't really understand this kind of relationship today, and quick judgments are bound to be shallow.",positive

"Similar to the 2016 ""Ghostbusters"" remake and 2017's ""Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,"" ""Captain Marvel"" is neither the flag-planting feminist anthem, nor the culture-war-dismantling failure that either side of the aisle would have you think it is. It's fine. It's a movie that's neither worthy of significant praise (beyond it being watchable and easily disposable, that is) or substantive criticism (it is terribly formulaic). This is simply ""a movie."" Something you can pop on in the background while doing something else in your house. The action is competent. The humor is okay.

"As much as I like Walter Matthau, I felt that the majority of his roles were tailored towards his personality. This role is one of the exceptions. He plays a dentist who is both charming and dishonest. This role does require much more acting than in most of his other roles. I liked the fact that the movie was honest about how a professional can be dishonest in order to avoid commitment in a relationship. His whole aim was to find a way to be in a relationship with a much younger woman, but not to be committed in any way. The alibi - using his secretary (Ingrid Bergman) to pretend to be his wife. At some point in the movie, the pretend Mr. and Mrs. actually are deluded into believing that they were actually really married.

The government officials arrive to evacuate the town about to be inundated by a new hydroelctrical dam. There are the other visitors in the town, the angels from another time but they only seen by a dying boy Irvin. A local priest (Nick Nolte in a quiet heartbreaking performance) takes care of the boy. Irvin pleads with the angels to leave the place with them...<br /><br />There is some unearthly quality in the film, some dignified mourning and sublime sadness when you suddenly realize the inevitable finality of everything - humans and their relationships, cities, countries, civilizations, the whole world as we know it. Death and birth have something in common - we go through them in the ultimate loneliness. <br /><br />I cannot recall the film that affected me in the same way and as deeply as ""Northfork"" did, the film so beautiful and so tender, so quiet and so powerful, so heartbreaking and so moving.

"To solve a challenging problem, you need to start by asking the right questions. Without these, even the biggest library of information is useless. This movie does just that - where other movies guide your thinking along a story board, this film pulls at your emotions and your understanding of justice and what's permissible. These questions will tug at you throughout, challenging your assumptions as the characters develop. This movie is important. It's relevant, and a must see for anybody who stays informed of current affairs. The fact it's highly entertaining and includes a slew of movie stars only improves the execution. My advice: watch it with a serious crowd or better yet, by yourself, not unlike how you'd read an editorial from your favorite news magazine. In this case there is one difference: the answers will be your own.",positive

"Never mind if 'National Velvet (1944)' is a bit hackneyed and occasionally unconvincing, Clarence Brown's equestrian fable is an endearing and very likable story with a good moral. After achieving modest success through her appearance in 'Lassie Come Home (1943),' young Elizabeth Taylor, age 12, landed her first leading role as Velvet Brown, a passionate schoolgirl with an obsession for horses. Though filmed in California, the story - adapted from a novel by Enid Bagnold - is set in a small township on the English countryside, and full advantage is taken of the Technicolor photography to present the vibrant and handsome landscapes of blue skies and green shrubs. Mickey Rooney takes top billing as Mi Taylor, a misguided ex-jockey with devious intentions, whose relationship with young Velvet reawakens his sense of dignity and opens a new, optimistic chapter in his life. Though he noticeably struggles in one sequence, when he must confess the traumatic experience that led to his fear of horses, Rooney is enjoyable as the surly but passionate young man who must prove his worth.<br /><br />It is perhaps a good thing that Elizabeth Taylor had those entrancing violet eyes, because her acting abilities, at this young age, were rather limited. Her more emotional sequences, in which she displays courage and integrity in the face of adversity, strike one as being rather hollow, and the touchingly-naive notion that simply ""believing"" will accomplish everything is one that has since been repeated ad nauseam by practically every unmemorable inspirational sporting film ever made. Nevertheless, Taylor is bright-eyed and enthusiastic, and she works well with Mickey Rooney, who was no stranger to being a child-star. Anne Revere plays a very important role as Velvet's mother, once a famous athlete, who not only swam the English Channel but was lovingly-trained by none other than Mi Taylor's own father. I liked that Mi was not told about this until the film's final seconds, with Mrs. Brown correctly deciding that the young man would first need to develop his own sense of decency, rather than exploiting the memory of his late father for financial gain, as he would undoubtedly have done at the film's beginning.<br /><br />The film reaches its climax at the Grand National Sweepstakes, where Velvet has, at the last moment, decided to ride her own horse, the Pi, in the world-famous competition. Under the guise of a Latvian male, she goes on, as expected, to win the race, but is later disqualified - either because she's a girl, or because she tumbled from the horse before she was allowed to dismount (what a stupid rule!). This extended race sequence is exceedingly well-done, effectively capturing the nervous tension of those nerve-racking pre-race seconds, and the confusion of the event that places us in the same position as Rooney's character, stranded behind tall spectators and waiting anxiously for somebody to provide an accurate update. It doesn't really matter that we know it's a stunt double doing most of the difficult riding - in several scenes, we can clearly see a creepy-looking man in a wig - but the positive message remains the same. I'll wager that 'National Velvet' has nurtured the imaginations of millions of young girls over the last sixty years, and it's power to inspire has decreased little with time.",positive

"This movie definitely made me laugh but that doesn't mean it was exactly funny. Well, then again, me and my friends had a lot of fun watching it.<br /><br />I doubt there is anything about this movie that hasn't been done at least twice before, just like the plot itself. All of the characters are overused movie cliché cardboard-box roles that don't even require acting skills; accordingly, such skills are not delivered. We have the corrupt cop, a ruthless killer who claims to care about his men and their families whilst caring nothing about people he shoots in the forehead at so close a range as to have blood spat on his face. We have the ""worn-out cop on the edge"" so nicely pointed at in the discussion boards of this movie; we have the old one-day-away-from-retirement-cop who just about everyone must have immediately identified as the most likely man on the inside, since he had most to gain and he didn't utter a trustworthy word throughout the movie. About as see-through as a glass house on a sunny day. The big black gangster king was a copy of all previous big black gangster kings in movie history (they could've just called him Marcellus Wallace), but just slightly tougher and more ruthless, because something has to emphasize that we also know Laurence Fishburne from actually good movies. Then we finally have the HIGHLY EDUCATED doctor who can't think of anything reasonable to do as soon as the situation differs from her ordinary life and who spends the majority of the movie sitting in a corner helplessly trying to figure out how to hold on to the weapon she was given. NOT USING IT.<br /><br />The whole siege story is not interesting, not original (having been used twice before), and this movie manages to add absolutely nothing interesting to it. There is the initial probe, then the laying of the siege, then the assault, then the escape attempts. Meanwhile a bunch of strained, stressed, freaked out cops and thugs manage to hold off a Police assault team with high-tech equipment and the quite important advantage of VISION. Then again, in deep night, with the power cut and with a snow storm raging overhead, there is definitely a lot of light coming in, so who really cares about night vision.<br /><br />But the best part comes right at the end. In the first scenes showing Precinct 13, we see it is situated in an outskirt of an industrial city; factories and office buildings surround it on all sides. From this point, the besieged walk maybe a hundred meters in a sewer and where do they end up? Some alley ending right in the middle of a forest! A FOREST! Where did that forest come from? Who decided to lay a pine forest in the middle of an industrial area? How is this forest, in the last scene, suddenly on a hill over the city in question, while in the scenes inside the forest it looked deceptively FLAT?? <br /><br />From here I leave the judgment to you, and to your common sense. Go and see this movie if you're looking for an unintended good laugh, I can really recommend it.",negative

The opening scenes of wanton vandalism are not only pointless but baffling as well - it's never explained why the film opens with a tracking shot of people trashing each other's houses - and nothing improves from there. By the time the film unearths the oldest joke in the book - the horrible dragon of a mother-in-law turns up unexpectedly to stay - is followed by the crashingly obvious revelation that she's developing a soft spot for the black neighbour's father, moving her bigoted son to ever greater depths of self-righteous, ignorant rage, most discerning viewers will have switched off. Take that as a warning, unless you're keen on cheapskate spin-offs with terrible acting, static direction and the overall comic flair of a burning orphanage.",negative

"Deepa has again tried to bravely bring out a subject that no one wants to talk about. The story line is OK, cinematography is outstanding, screenplay and acting are way below average. I guess the blame is to the citizens of Uttar Pradesh in India from where her original set was destroyed in 2000. This resulted in a totally different cast, I just wonder what a spectacular movie it would have been if it had the original Shabana Azmi, Nandita Das and Aamir Khan. The current actors Lisa Ray (who's just good for squirming in Bombay Dyeing bedsheets) and John Abraham are pathetic, need basic lessons in acting. Seema Biswas, Raghubir Yadav and Kulbushan Kharbabda have saved the movie as much as they can. The kid had done an outstanding job. The editing and the flow of the movie is also not something you would have expected from Deepa. Great subject, sends out a strong message about a practice which is still pretty rampant in rural India but falls short of the standards Deepa set for herself in Fire and Earth.

"This is probably one of the only Marvel films I have scored the lowest.  Overall it's not a bad movie.  They did a good job of bringing these characters to life.

Also, not thrilled with the fact that Marvel Studios is trying to make her the strongest one in the movies when she's not.

"Although I like Kurt Vonnegut, I'm not particularly interested in spy stories and I didn't know this one. The only reason I watched it was Nick Nolte, who is one of my favorite actors since I saw ""Breakfast of Champions"" and ""Hotel Rwanda"". But the film brought me a pleasant surprise. Of course Nolte was great, but so was the plot. There was relatively little political intrigue, and much more focus on the moral question: by reading his anti-Semitic radio commentaries with hidden secret messages to Americans, he in fact contributed to the general attitude of Germans (and, as it later turns out, Americans) towards Jews or Hitler. Which carries more weight, his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-semitism? The dilemma is even more prominent as these words are never spoken, not even as narration. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a person who learnt to hide his feelings so perfectly that he doesn't open up, not even in his memoirs. The inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray - but with the help of excellent acting and photography, this film manages. <br /><br />There are other points to it, such as the humor or the ironical use of romantic clichés (like the song White Christmas), that make it real different from average American movies. I recommend it to everyone who is bored with Hollywood spy movies.",positive

"This is a horrible little film--and unfortunately, the company that made this short made several others. The short is essentially a one-joke idea that wasn't funny to begin with and may also offend you. It certainly made me uncomfortable watching very young children (most appeared about 2 years-old) cavorting about and pretending to be adults--in this case, a dancehall girl and bar room patrons. It's the sort of humor that you might be forced to laugh at from your own kids if they pretended to be adults, but I can't see anyone WANTING to see this--especially when a very young Shirley Temple is dressed in a rather slinky outfit and acts like a vamp!! And then, other kids act like adults in some rather adult situations.

"I can't say how closely the film follows the novel, never having read the book, but since this clocks in at some six and a half hours it's a good bet that most of the base are covered or, at least, we can say with some certainty that this isn't a Reader's Digest condensed version.<br /><br />The production values are high, well up to the standards of other BBC classic series like Inspector Morse and Sherlock Holmes. We can believe Dickens' London looked, sounded, and thought a lot like this. There are some occasional minor lapses -- some sportsman firing a pistol with a percussion cap in 1840 or 1820 or whenever this took place.<br /><br />The acting too is to be applauded. Suzanne Burden is the polite and honest heroine who quietly goes about doing good. She's cute too, in a mature way, her beauty in her compassionate nature not in any flirtatiousness. Denholm Elliott is her guardian (and more than that, as it turns out). Burden and Elliott are two of the very few characters who are good in an unalloyed way. Another is a former sergeant forced to do evil by evil people. Another is a poor and helpless young boy.<br /><br />I don't think anyone else could have written this. It's got all the earmarks of Dickens -- poverty, tragic deaths, capitalism in the raw, the generous rich guy in his gated home, hidden parentage, shadowy motives, and the impotence or outright maliciousness of the justice system. Well, not the justice system as a whole but the chancery, which was evidently a court that decided matters having to do with the distribution of property. (So I gather from Wikipedia.) It became so notoriously rigid and dilatory that it was thoroughly revamped in England in 1973. Twice, Elliott's character describes it as ""a curse."" The most impressive scene involves a money-scrounging creditor hounding a retired soldier in the latter's gymnasium during a fencing lesson. The sergeant is more masculine in the traditional sense than any other male character I remember from Dickens. The apoplectic money lender and renter is screaming threats from his seat and the sergeant turns towards him and does one delicate exercise with the saber after another, each advancement bringing him closer to his tormentor, while the scarlet-faced old creditor shrinks back into his seat.<br /><br />A couple of things are missing. Often Dickens will stick in at least one or two amusing lines of dialog. (""Humbug!"" or ""The law is a ass."") Not here. ""Bleak"" house is the right title. Second, there are practically no Weberian ""ideal types"" -- no Mr. Micawbers or Artful Dodgers or Scrooges. Third, the atmosphere, the whole ethos, is relentlessly dismal. One tribulation follows another, usually having to do with money or some shameful peccadillo out of the past.<br /><br />My God, it's depressing. It's as if the author were venting his spleen on everything he hated in the world he knew. Poverty, okay. He KNEW poverty. But one wonders what the chancery did to Dickens to deserve this kind of treatment.<br /><br />Maybe I should add that I've just watched the first episode of the 2005 series -- and it's better in two ways. There is more zip in the direction, so the pace is a little faster. And the business of Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce is explained satisfactorily right up front, instead of lurking about in the shadows as that mysterious ""curse,"" so the plot is easier to follow.",positive

"This movie is good for entertainment purposes, but it is not historically reliable. If you are looking for a movie and thinking to yourself `Oh I want to learn more about Custer's life and his last stand', do not rent `They Died with Their Boots On'. But, if you would like to watch a movie for the enjoyment of an older western film, with a little bit of romance and just for a good story, this is a fun movie to watch.<br /><br />The story starts out with Custer's (Errol Flynn) first day at West Point. Everyone loves his charming personality which allows him to get away with most everything. The movie follows his career from West Point and his many battles, including his battle in the Civil War. The movie ends with his last stand at Little Big Horn. In between the battle scenes, he finds love and marriage with Libby (Olivia De Havilland).<br /><br />Errol Flynn portrays the arrogant, but suave George Armstrong Custer well. Olivia De Havilland plays the cute, sweet Libby very well, especially in the flirting scene that Custer and Libby first meet. Their chemistry on screen made you believe in their romance. The acting in general was impressive, especially the comedic role ( although stereotypical) of Callie played by Hattie McDaniel. Her character will definitely make you laugh.<br /><br />The heroic war music brought out the excitement of the battle scenes. The beautiful costumes set the tone of the era. The script, at times, was corny, although the movie was still enjoyable to watch. The director's portrayal of Custer was as a hero and history shows this is debatable. Some will watch this movie and see Custer as a hero. Others will watch this movie and learn hate him.<br /><br />I give it a thumbs up for this 1942 western film.",positive

George Clooney puts in a humorous and brief cameo as a wheeled safe cracker that, for the most part left me wondering two things... 1. wouldn't every comedy be better if Mr. Clooney put in a strange 5 minute cameo? and 2. How do they make fake tattoos that look old and faded, and how easily do they wash off? The cast, all fine actors in their own right, put in a great job, and you get the impression that they had a good time working together which is fairly important in a movie like this. Needless to say all does not go as planned in this movie, both plot-wise and humor-wise, but it made me check out the special features and consider watching the original, so I consider it a success! Rent this one for a good time, maybe grab a few friends and a pizza. you'll have a good time.<br /><br />***7/10***<br /><br />On a side note, the soundtrack is spectacular. It's great to hear the far under appreciated Paolo Conte used, and it left me humming snippets of the score long after the credits rolled.",positive
"It would be a stretch to call this movie â€śgoodâ€ť but it wasn't as bad as I was expecting it to be. The Skrulls were disappointing- they looked like something out of a high school play rather than a big budget movie. The storyline was decent enough I suppose and didn't bore. However, the depiction of Mar-Vell was ridiculous, and a much more dynamic actor should have been cast as Carol Danvers. They tried to accomplish â€śgirl power â€ś with shameless pandering rather than substance- probably should have watched Wonder Woman to see how that is done. Overall it's a very skippable movie in the Marvel Universe. ",negative

"""Rush in Rio"" is, no doubt, one of the most exciting DVDs I have purchased. Although I am a biased Rush fan of almost 20 years, I found this performance to be flawless. The music is heavy and sharp (which sounds great on any surround sound system), the band is energetic, the crowd has a constant smile... it's like they were able to capture every concert I've been to. For any Rush fan, this DVD is a must; if anything, just to see the ""Boys in Brazil"" documentary (which reveals the travels of this rather isolated, personal band). For any non-Rush fan, this DVD is an enjoyable concert. Rush fans know the talent of these three Canadians. We have rather firmly stood by them for years. I've shown this DVD (or portions of it, anyway) to those who have never heard of Rush, or those who think Rush is less than good because they do not appeal to the pessimistic masses of rock (i.e., sex, drugs, and a drunken frenzy). The bottom line is this DVD is worth every penny and more than worth the time to view it.",positive

"This movie was so underwhelming. Captain Marvel is one of the most interesting and powerful characters in the Marvel Universe yet the film came across as boring and annoying. There is no reason to be emotionally engaged or attached to Captain Marvel as she has little to no personality. Furthermore the whole film seems to be an over the top feminist propaganda story. People come to watch superhero movies for escapism and politicising films, if it's essential to the film is fine if it's essential to the plot. (i.e a Suffragettes movie) but in Captain Marvel's case it comes across as forced and repetitive. The only saving graces of this movie are: Nick Fury, who provides all the comedy and heart that Carol Danvers doesn't and the post-credit scene which is a nice teaser for Endgame even if she played little part in the film. ",controversial
"This movie does not deserve the hate that it's gotten. Brie Larson does a great job in portraying Carl Danvers, and her performance, in my opinion, was not wooden as many reviewers have stated. I really enjoyed the chemistry between her and Samuel Jackson, and each scene with them both flowed so well. The action sequences, and CGI were very well done. My only issue was that some of the action scenes were a bit too dark and hard to make out who was fighting who. Overall, it was another fantastic film in the MCU, and I can't wait to see Captain Marvel make her appearance in Endgame. ",negative

"Went into the movie expecting a feminist approach and came out bitterly disappointed. Brie suited the role and the role was poorly written. Captain Marvel did not win any fights, often being thrown to the ground and having to be bailed out. When she did, she would give them mercy, leaving a bad taste. Her whole role in the film was the wipe men's asses because they couldn't wipe it themselves, and felt like the reason why the movie was made was so she could wipe Iron Man's ass later. No character development - the only was that her emotions got the better of her, and by the end she was able to suppress them in order to become stronger, which is laughably horrific when you think about the treatment of women throughout the centuries coupled with Captain Marvel standing next to the Hulk.nBesides these feminist woes, Captain Marvel was not enough as a stand alone movie, and felt like a filler episode for the Avengers.",controversial

"I almost slept through the film. It's just another marvel movie without the funny wit and a little bit of propaganda sprinkled in.nIt even manages to disrespect the entirety of the previous movies.nBrie Larson's portrayal of Carel Danvers is lacking at best, this could have been amazing, but they managed to fuck it up with a major fart.",controversial
"I'm not going to say this was the best move ever, it doesn't need to be.  It's good.  It's fun.  It's a strong female character with no romantic subplot.  It's a woman finding her own inner strength, despite the world, and everyone she's known, telling her she's not good enough.nnWatch it, it's worth the box office price, my wife and I enjoyed it greatly.",positive
".Took me 3 weeks to post.  This isn't a suspicion anymore.nnI didn't enjoy Brie's performance at all: bland and charmless. The humour was off (not entirely sure that's her fault and not the director/scriptwriters). Mind you, even a more personable actor mightn't have saved the day, as Marvel have decided to import the biggest headache of the DC universe, namely that the lead character is invincible. Sure, Superman can be taken down with Kyptonite, but failing that it's all pre-ordained. Well, of course, we usually know who's going to survive any film, but *in theory* they could die, and they all have faults that make them endearing or relatable. Not so with Carol Danvers. I'm genuinely worried for Endgame now (Thanos? No problem, let's call Captain Marvel), and really concerned about the MCU after than if Captain Marvel is going to be the anchor. Still, we've had a good run, I suppose.nnAnd yes, if you give this movie 5 stars, you're full of it.",negative
"Saw it Friday night.  Overall, it was worth seeing.  Seeing a young Nick Fury was pretty cool, the cat was funny.  Action scenes were decent.  Maybe I was expecting more, but it was worth seeing.  What I didnt like were the plot holes that a lead writer and someone making sure the Captain Marvel piece of the MCU fit correctly rather than shoved in and twisted.  It could have been a really great movie but, it felt rushed and sorta formulaic. I hope to see more of Brie Larson as Capt Marvel and see her character developed much better.

I wouldn't call this a bad movie but with the MCU reputation this movie was disappointing. Compared to DC's Wonder woman movie (which has its issues to) it wasn't the best that was offered.  Captain Marvel as a Character didn't face any real challenges to challenge her powers and her ability to think.(by the way the fight with Yon-Rogg was disappointing to see because CPT. Marvel didn't show emotion but he did and he was all about controlling emotion and her character arc was about showing emotion).,negative

Ann Grant (Claire Danes) is welcomed by Lila's alcoholic and reckless brother Buddy (Hugh Dancy) in the Wittenborn's cottage at seaside and he tells her that his sister is in love actually for their friend and servant Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson), who fought in the war and has graduated in medicine.

The resemblance of the stunning Mamie Gummer with her mother Meryl Streep is amazing and she has a performance that honors the name of her mother. The locations, costumes, set decoration, cinematography and soundtrack are also awesome. Unfortunately the plot is confused and I have not clearly understood the message of this film. Why motherhood is so important in the story? Was Constance engendered in the night stand of Ann and Harris and he would be her father? Why Ann and Harris have not stayed together, if the guy really loved her like he confesses in their occasional encounter in New York? Which issues Ann Lord has resolved after the visit of Lila Ross? Was Buddy Wittenborn bisexual or his love for Harris was a fraternal love? Why Nina Mars changed her thoughts about motherhood in the end?

"A recent story-line from 2018 in THE LIFE OF CAPTAIN MARVEL actually establish a brand new twist on the character's origins, making her the daughter of a female Kree warrior and a human, in a plot very reminiscent of AQUAMAN's origin story, right down to the lighthouse keeper finding a stranded alien woman. Having part of her power and legacy coming from her own mother, and not specifically from the accident with Mar-Vell, helps to ground the feminist narrative a bit more strongly. There are also some interesting elements through her history, from a bout with alcoholism, her impulsiveness and her amnesia that, in the words of author Gerry Conway, helps to set a ""parallel between her quest for identity, and the modern woman's quest for raised consciousness,for self-liberation, for identity. In a way, that's intentional. Ms. Marvel, because of her name if nothing else, is influenced, to a great extent, by the move towards women's liberation. She is not a Marvel Girl; she's a woman. Not a Miss or a Mrs.- a Ms. Her own person. Herself "". nnThere is definitely a strong presence of that theme in Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck's film, where Brie Larson's Kree warrior Vers struggle with memories of a past she is unfamiliar with, and is on a quest to discover who she really is, a journey that may just help her tap into an unexpected power she possess. The feminist subtext couldn't be any clearer. The character's amnesia, which is never portrayed as being debilitating, is an engrossing engine that keeps the film going and gives it a lot of heart. The story by the directorial team and Geneva Robertson-Dworet does also carry a bit of political subtext that feels especially relevant these days, even though it can't keep all of its plot twists from being guessed way ahead of time. But it does contain a few good ones that may surprise longtime comic book readers.nnThe 90s settings is a fun way to exploit fully the ''ghosting'' technology that mapped younger versions of Kurt Russell, Michael Douglas or Robert Downey Jr.'s faces on their bodies in earlier installments of the MCU filmography, giving us a rather convincing thirty-something Samuel Jackson (as well as a twenty-something Clark Cregg) reprising his role as youthful and not quite as world-weary, agent Nick Fury. The technology, which also helped resurrect Peter Cushing for ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY, has never been used so extensively before, and open doors to not only actors being able to be younger for a whole film (Would SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY known a better fate if Harrison Ford would have played himself as a younger man?), but also for performers to be allegedly able to use body doubles when they have previous engagement. nnSamuel L. Jackson and Brie Larson share great chemistry, trading banter all through the film, and making one wish for a reunion that may, or may not happen in the upcoming AVENGERS: ENDGAME. The supporting cast is equally strong, including an emotional portrayal by Lashana Lynch as Maria Rambeau (The aforementioned Monica Rameau's mother and Carole Danvers' best friend). It has to be noted that there is no love interest in CAPTAIN MARVEL. Carol Danvers doesn't need to be defined by her relationship to a man. Her closest bond is in fact with her best friend Maria Rambeau, her fellow fighter pilot, who tells her in a touching moment: ""You were the most powerful woman I knew right before you could shoot fire from your fists"". As for the rest of the stellar cast, Jude Law is serviceable as Vers' mentor Yon-Rogg, and both Ben Mendelsohn as the Skrull leader Talos and Annette Bening in a surprising dual role seem to have a lot of fun with their characters. nnSpeaking of the Skrulls, as a comic book fan, I have to admit I was overjoyed by the inclusion of one of the most ancient alien race in the Marvel intergalactic stable, and how close to their original design they were. The film goes in some interesting directions with the shape-shifting alien race, but one feels that their full potential have yet to be realized. And could the FANTASTIC FOUR be far away, now that one of their earliest foes have now entered the Marvel Universe? We know that they have now reverted ownership to Disney from Fox, and a reboot is most likely imminent.nnCAPTAIN MARVEL is a worthy addition to the MCU menagerie of heroes, and will provide some much needed muscles in their upcoming conflicts, as well as opening up further the space frontier that was conquered by the GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY. It may be Marvel's first film featuring a female superhero as its main star, it may not be able to benefit from the cultural impact WONDER WOMAN had as a feminist benchmark in blockbuster superhero film-making, having come second in that particular game. Even though it did awaken hordes of insecure incels threatened by Brie Larson's statements about the lack of diversity at press junkets and her refusal to applaud when accused sexual harasser Casey Affleck took the stage at the 2017 Oscars. It could also be the fear of losing the hegemony of male dominated blockbusters, but let's face it, this is one monopoly that is in no danger of going away. Films like WONDER WOMAN and CAPTAIN MARVEL, or female leads like Rey and Jyn Erso in the recent STAR WARS movies are important role models for young women and girls who can look up to something else than princesses and Bratz. And not only little girls. I remember seeing a young boy miming using a bow and arrow coming out of the theater showing WONDER WOMAN, evoking the fierce Amazon Warriors from Themiscyra. nn''I'm kind of done with you telling me what I can't do.'' Carole Danvers says at one point in the film, which is already raking in hundreds of millions. The message to insecure males couldn't be clearer.nnJust smile, guys. You look so much nicer when you smile.nnnPS: The film deserves extra credits for the lovely tribute to Captain Marvel co-creator Stan Lee at the very beginning, which made this comic book fan a bit choked up. And his obligatory cameo will make one Kevin Smith very happy!",controversial

"Brass pictures (movies is not a fitting word for them) really are somewhat brassy. Their alluring visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive high class TV commercials. But unfortunately Brass pictures are feature films with the pretense of wanting to entertain viewers for over two hours! In this they fail miserably, their undeniable, but rather soft and flabby than steamy, erotic qualities non withstanding.<br /><br />Senso '45 is a remake of a film by Luchino Visconti with the same title and Alida Valli and Farley Granger in the lead. The original tells a story of senseless love and lust in and around Venice during the Italian wars of independence. Brass moved the action from the 19th into the 20th century, 1945 to be exact, so there are Mussolini murals, men in black shirts, German uniforms or the tattered garb of the partisans. But it is just window dressing, the historic context is completely negligible.<br /><br />Anna Galiena plays the attractive aristocratic woman who falls for the amoral SS guy who always puts on too much lipstick. She is an attractive, versatile, well trained Italian actress and clearly above the material. Her wide range of facial expressions (signalling boredom, loathing, delight, fear, hate ... and ecstasy) are the best reason to watch this picture and worth two stars.

"Naturally, along with everyone else, I was primed to expect a lot of Hollywood fantasy revisionism in THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON over the legend of Custer. Just having someone like Errol Flynn play Custer is enough of a clue that the legend has precedence over the truth in this production. And for the most part my expectations were fulfilled (in an admittedly rousing and entertaining way).<br /><br />Yet even in this obviously biased (and much criticized) retelling of the Custer story, I was struck by some of the points made in this movie that, sometimes subtly but nevertheless solidly, seemed to counter the typical clichés of manifest destiny and unvarnished heroism usually found in Westerns of the early 20th century.<br /><br />For instance, even while this film attempted to whitewash it's hero, certain scenes still suggested the more flawed and foolish character of the real-life Custer: <br /><br />1) His initial entrance at the West Point front gate, in which his arrogance and pompousness is a clear aspect of his character.<br /><br />2) His miserable record at West Point, which seems to be attributed as much to Custer's cluelessness about the demands of military service as any other factor; there are moments in the way Flynn plays Custer at West Point where he seems downright stupid.<br /><br />3) Custer's promotion to General is not only presented as a ridiculous mistake, but it plays out as slapstick comedy. I half-expected to see the Marx Brothers or Abbott and Costello wander into the scene.<br /><br />4) Custer's stand against Jeb Stuart at Gettysburg is not whitewashed as brilliant military tactical leadership, but is presented as reckless and wildly lucky.<br /><br />5) Custer's drinking problem is certainly not ignored.<br /><br />And although the music and some of the ways the Indians were shown in this film were certainly reinforcements of the racist stereotype of the ignorant savage, it still came as a surprise to me that the movie actually went into some detail as to why the Indians were justified in attacking the whites who were moving into their land, and fairly explicitly laid the blame for the battles in the Black Hills squarely at the foot of the white man. In fact, no one can argue that the clear villain of the piece is not Anthony Quinn as Sitting Bull, but Arthur Kennedy & Co. as the white devils making the false claim of gold in the Black Hills. Sure, that part of the story is true, but I didn't expect to see it portrayed quite so unequivically in a movie like this.<br /><br />And one other thing: usually in these films it is the Indians who are portrayed en masse as drunken animals seemingly incapable of the basic common sense to avoid getting falling down drunk any time they get near alcohol. In this movie, it is actually the troops of the 7th Cavalry, and not the Indians, who in at least two scenes are portrayed this way.<br /><br />All in all, this movie slips in some surprising moments in the midst of the Hollywood bunk.",positive

I was expecting the drama surrounding the feminist messaging to be overblown and not that big of a deal but the political messaging in this was so obvious that it really did harm the movie, making it much less enjoyable.

"Dogtown and Z-Boys is a documentary about the Zephyr Skateboarding Team, and their influence on skateboarding. It also focuses on the history of skateboarding. It was directed by Stacy Peralta, a member of the original Zephyr Team, and was written by Stacy Peralta and Craig Stecyk, another member of the team. The documentary stars the members of the Zephyr Team and is narrated by Sean Penn.<br /><br />The documentary talks about the beginning of skateboarding, and how it evolved from surfing. It discusses skateboarding's popularity in the late 60s and the 70s, its decline in the 80s and its 'rebirth' in the 90s. Skateboarding was introduced in Dogtown, the nickname of the poor side of Santa Monica, California. The Zephyr Team originated from the Zephyr Surf Shop, which manufactured the first modern skateboards. The documentary mainly consists of the original Zephyr Team members talking about the past in the Zephyr Team, the competitions they won, and their popularity and prestige. It focuses on three particular members of the team; Peralta, Tony Alva, and Jay Adams, three virtuosos of skateboarding, and probably the best three members of the team.<br /><br />The interviews in the documentary were usually voices over archival footage from Dogtown in the late 60s and 70s. Very rarely to you actually see the people being interviewed, but when you do, they are shown in black and white, while the archival footage was in colour. I think Stacy Peralta used this technique to show that the documentary was about the past (i.e. the Glory Days of the Zephyr Team) and not the present. The documentary is very fast paced, in that we often see clips of impressive skateboarding over up-beat music of the era (such as Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and David Bowie), and the interviews tend to be quick and to the point. Knowing nothing about skateboarding (i.e. not even knowing how to ride one straight along the ground) I was very surprised that I found this documentary so interesting. The reason is that this doco was more about the Zephyr Team than the actual sport of skateboarding, so while I couldn't relate to skateboarding, I could relate to the boys in the team. Because it was made by actual members of the team, it gives it a little more depth and authenticity.<br /><br />All in all, I would have to say this is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. It gave me a whole new insight, not just into the Zephyr Team, but into skateboarding as a whole. For those who love skateboarding, I can only imagine how it must be even more interesting. Seven and a half stars out of ten.",positive
"An amazing movie and character addition to the MCU, regardless of what butt hurt fanboys rate it at.  Captain Marvel(Brie Larson) is possibly the last and greatest chance the Marvel heroes will have at defeating Thanos in this coming movie version of the final battle Endgame.  This movie is an excellent origin story of exactly how Captain Marvel gains her possibly limitless powers and very nicely links characters we've encountered before from other movies, (Ronin) played by Lee Pace makes a surprising cameo and gives us hints to why he eventually becomes the character that the Guardians eventually deal with and defeat.nOther beloved characters are also present from earlier/later time frame films which also give us little hints at the growing complexity of character entanglements and just how some of these characters are all tied together in the MCU.nLarson's character is an amazing character to me in terms of positive role models for young girls to look up to, and before I get flamed by some fanboy or whoever, yes I know she is fictional, but the heartmoving and emotional portrayal of determination to never give up, even if you get knocked down and just because you are a girl doesn't mean that you don't have strength, the simple fact that she keeps getting up is a lesson all young women should see and pay attention to.nBeing a father to an amazing daughter I want, no need my daughter to see that so she knows that not all superheroes are guys, girls can kick ass just as much as guys and in Captain Marvels situation she can kick ass even more.  I highly recommend this movie and if you have a daughter you need to take her to see it.  Peace out and nuff said",controversial

For someone to have said that this film was made for poker fans and not film fans, that someone is kidding their self (it was probably the writer/director).

Yes there was a certain element of over the top feminist tones and I hope that is pulled back in future (I'm surprise that Destinys Child - Survivor didn't get a song play) but in terms of the future MCU let's not forget that Thor 1 and 2 were pretty lame and arguably Iron Man 2 but those characters have still shone through over the general course of things.

"There are times I am convinced that The Mikado is the best Sullivan & Gilbert opera ever, but that is only so long as I'm not listening to Iolanthe. Be that as it may, The Mikado is probably the most frequently filmed of the Savoy Operas. (Yes, I put the composer first. Nobody says Hammerstein and Rodgers, or Hart and Rodgers, or Boito and Verdi, or What's-His-Face and Strauss. You don't even hear the names of librettists for Offenbach, Suppe, or Balfe. Gilbert was just the bigger name (and the bigger ego) at the time, so they put his name first. It's time that silly practice was put to rest.<br /><br />Anyway, The Mikado is a compleat S&G operetta. It has some of Sullivan's catchiest numbers, combined with some of Gilbert's cleverest lyrics. It has an interesting book and sprightly dialogue. It's got a wonderful degree of craziness. And it leaves the door wide open for elaborate and whimsical costuming.<br /><br />This particular production, filmed in a live performance in 1990, turns its imagination toward striking simplicity. Set in a British seaside resort toward the end of the Art Nouveau period, it throws over the japonerie of the original entirely. The result is costuming and setting in an eye-caressing medley of whites, grey, and blacks, accented by occasional bits of red (and less frequent uses of yellow and green). It takes some getting used to, but it's really spiffy. Of course, when the chorus tells you they are gentlemen of Japan, you would be right to exclaim, ""Oh, pooh. Bah!"" (Did I just say that?) It's most gratifying that this fine production is now on DVD. However, one caveat: the print seems to be photographed through a glass of imperfect clarity, so that the expected sharpness of the image is softened and ever so slightly fuzzy. The tendency to superimpose images is, alas, annoying. Why do people who are doing a really spiffy production want to muck it up with artsy-fartsy stuff of that sort? But it's the performance that counts the most. We may skip the overture, since although one is performed, Sullivan never wrote one. (True, it may be so he wrote none for any of the Savoys. But the Mikado overture doesn't even date from Sullivan's lifetime and was compiled by observing the techniques used in the others.) As for the rest of the operetta, it's first-rate and supremely funny.<br /><br />The Ko-Ko here is the estimable Eric Idle, who does it credit. There is a tradition of bringing a Big Name into the role. The was a U.S. TV production years ago in which Ko-Ko was played by Groucho Marx with mixed results. Idle's performance is delightfully quirky ... he does ""Taken from a county jail"" assisted by a tennis racquet. His ""I've Got a Little List"" is done as a speech to a microphone -- of course it has the usual updated lyrics, which are much funnier than the usual run of such things, and his delivery is positively hysterical. It goes on that way throughout.<br /><br />In this operetta, it's important to have a good Katisha; it's just no fun if you're not being bellowed at in style. This Mikado has a fabulous Katisha in Felicity Palmer, in her way almost as Big a Name as Idle. She bellows with the best of them in a wonderful rich contralto ... wonderful, especially, for a soprano. And her costume...!!! (Not to mention her recital with Franz Liszt, apparently, accompanying.) Nanki-Poo is played by Bonaventura Bottone. I have trouble getting around is somewhat un-Nanki-Pooish chubby shortness -- but is voice is undeniably a solid, rich addition to the vocal palette. There is a nice touch during ""A Wand'ring Minstrel"", where the chorus reacts with distaste to the mention of ""his nancy on his knee"" -- bear in mind the Mikado's decree about flirting. Be that as it may, Bottone is a fine singing actor and if his appearance doesn't put the best face on Nanki-Poo, his performance does.<br /><br />Yum-Yum (Lesley Garett) and her friends are appropriately pretty and silly. She and Bottone do lovely duets. Pish-Tush (Mark Richardson) plays his persona as something a blageur and does it very well. Poo Bah (Richard Van Allan) is wonderful as a stuffed shirt out of water ... a role later done to death in American sitcoms (you know: haughty butlers forced to cater to bratty children -- that sort of thing). The Mikado (Richard Angas) is bloody marvelous, with an imperious voice at absolute variance with his ridiculous lyrics.<br /><br />I don't recommend you get this as your only Mikado. Get a good traditional production as well, so you can see what Gilbert intended (more or less) in terms of staging. That being said, I'll watch this one twice while viewing any traditional bit once. On the whole this is a terrific offering, a vocal and visual delight, with delicious over-acting. It's a DVD to treasure, with dervish-like maids, tap-dancing bellhops, and all. Watch for the bellhops with signs.",positive
I was looking forward to this film but left disappointed for me it's the worst of the marvels films.

Hope when Captain Marvel shows up in Endgame they have figured out how to utilise the character better.  Right now I am more sure how she will fit in with the existing avengers.,negative

"The Coen Brothers have truly outdone themselves in this wonderful saga of three escaped convicts. Though it is based on ""The Odyssey,"" the ancient work of Homer, you do not have to have read ""The Odyssey"" to be able to follow the story. The brothers Coen have woven a tapestry of celluloid and aural delights! The soundtrack is intrinsic to the film, indeed it is as though the soundtrack is the product and the film is wrapping paper. Each character is wonderfully exploited and harkens back to the days of old when films were rich with character actors whose very appearance in the film adds richness, texture and authenticity. George Clooney is magnificent as the grease haired Everett Ulysses McGill, a honest con on the run whose pompous linguistics and vocabulary are comical and endearing. O Brother, Where Art Thou is easily the best Coen film to date as well as Clooney's best effort. Clooney is good enough to warrant a best actor nomination as is Tim Blake Nelson's portrayal of the dimwitted friend Delmar, while the film itself is deserving of a Best film nod.",positive
"Good movie, pacing was a little uneven and there were times when the CGI was a little too pronounced. Other than that it was a fairly solid origin story.

In the movie The Winter Soldier, Nick says ""the last time I trusted someone, I lost an eye"", in Captain Marvel Nick loses his eye while he is playing with the flerken, and this one scratches his eye, it is disappointing to know that someone was a flerken.n2. When the Kree capture Captain Marvel for the second time and try to erase their memory using the supreme intelligence, the Captain frees herself simply by making a great mental effort, so why the first time she could not free herself before the supreme intelligence? that makes no sensen3. Neither in the 90's, nor at present, there is artificial gravity within human spacecraft.n4. It is not possible for Captain Marvel to communicate in real time with aliens who are separated from Earth by tens, hundreds, or thousands of light years. The laws of physics prevent it.nnThis film did not have a villain that challenged the courage, or the captain's power, but it did have several mediocre villains. The film lacked quality in the scenes where the captain was animated with CGI, which is very rare in a marvel movie.

While it was not as popular in theaters, it soon became a beloved film on cable television and on VHS/DVD. Set in a seaport town in the good old USA (I forget the exact location), this is the story of a mysterious, passionately written love letter who sparks emotions and confusion among the principal characters, each who think the letter is personally addressed to them. By the end of the film, we don't know who the lover or the beloved is but the power of the letter has altered the lives of nearly everyone in the small town. The cast is made up of wonderful actors who have fared well on TV and film, among them Kate Capshaw in the lead role of middle-aged beauty Helen, a bookstore owner, comedienne Ellen DeGeneres as her friend/employee Janet Hall, young hottie Tom Everett Scott as Johnny, the young 20 something guy who falls for the older Hellen and an older Tom Selleck as the firefighter George Matthias who must compete with Johnny for Helen's affections. There are cameo roles by veteran old Hollywood actress Gloria Stuart, who is best known to modern audiences as the elderly Rose in ""Titanic"" (1997) and a cameo by Kate Capshaw's own daughter (with husband Steven Spielberg) Jessica Capshaw. The love triangle is between a middle-aged woman, an older man and a young man, each of whom feel as passionately for Helen as the writer of the mysterious letter. The conflict lies in Helen's indecision. Will she choose the right person ? Which man has the most to offer her ? Johnny is in a relationship with a girl his age who loves him with a passion all her own, and is in fact, a kind of reminder of what Helen was like at her age. George is in the process of divorcing his wife and has lived a worldly and eventful life. A cultured intellectual, he takes Helen on an opera date, where the tragic death of Puccini's ultra-Italian heroine Tosca moves Helen to explosive tears. There are lots of beautiful vistas of the charming coastal town, rendered beautifully by cinematographer Tami Reiker. The score is a paradise of romantic and lovely songs - "" I've Never Been In Love Before"", ""I'm In The Mood For Love"" and ""Only The Lonely"". Ellen DeGeneres as Janet Hall, who is consistently late to her job at Helen's bookshop, who endlessly dates men without being able to find the right guy , is simply wonderful. She has not lost her comedic flair, even though at this point in her career she was not appearing much on TV or film because only about two years before her hit mid-90's TV show ""Ellen"" was cancelled because of her ""coming out"" as a lesbian and the new lesbian subject matter of the show. Here you even find comedian Jack Black, long before he made it big, in the bit part of a fisherman. This is a moving film about human emotions and making decisions that are significant, about the human need for a passionate consuming love and the general love of escapism brought not only through books, letters, and music, but through a genuinely loving and secure relationship. This is a great film with wonderful moments and an infectious romantic spirit.",positive

I know we're supposed to get the impression that the family is wacky but good lord, they could've shortened that sequence by a good 15 minutes (seemingly, I didn't actually time it). By that point I was scratching my head looking for an exit.",negative

"It was a good movie. Not a great movie. More than a little confusing. Worth seeing to fill in backstory for Infinity War Endgame. It had a lot of what you expect in a prequel. Backstories and relationships we've come to know were fleshed out and explained. It went in a few directions I didn't expect which was interesting. Brie Larson's wooden delivery hurt the character somewhat. But her interactions with Nick Fury and other people in her past redeemed her overall performance. The odd looking â€śhelmetâ€ť that Captain Marvel wears is just strange and poor character design IMO. There were kids in the theater and they all seemed to enjoy it. Mar Vel is the MCU's first â€ścosmic levelâ€ť superhero. And the portrayal of this ramp up in power level was handled well. Larson? Well, maybe she'll improve as Tom Hiddleston's Loki Improved after his initial debut which was also wooden",positive
"It's pretty amazing how they have mixed up some of the expectations in the MCU.

Very well made i really enjoyed it and mostly i dont think theres anything wrong with it the only downfall i have is that people are criticizing it for being a origin story which is what you need for a new introduced hero because if you didn't have that you would know nothing about them unless you read the comics but those are now very hard to find and are expensive,positive

With his 2 best friends he tried to make a million pounds for his mum by starting an online business and adopting a pseudonym of ""Rudeboy"". His friends are Seymour (who likes to cook) and Danny (who is simple minded and the comic relief character).

"A kooky, but funny bit of diversion. You kind of have to see it from the beginning to follow what's happening, but each report to earth has it's own little joke. Pretty good special effects for a very low budget sci-fi t.v. show. It's fun to watch. Sort of in the vein of Red Dwarf, but even more low budget. For someone who's just coming in in the middle of one of the episodes, what you have to realize is that these guys are all incompetent, because they've been moved up the ladder of command, because the other officers died. Also, the main guys are from the laundry corps, which is why they have laundry in everything. If you like Red Dwarf, you'll probably like this. Slightly different t.v. concept, in that all you see is the Commander's report each day.<br /><br />It would be better if this were explained more, not just in the very beginning of the first episode, but then it was pretty hard to figure out what had happened in Red Dwarf too, if you hadn't been told.",positive

"Living just down the Hwy from Georgetown, Co...I remember this movie well and thought it was great! The story seems like something John would do even in real life, but there is something that I will always remember most about the movie. For those of you who don't live in Denver...every Christmas, the city of Denver, Co puts up a fabulous display of lights and decorations at the Civic Center in downtown Denver. Well...as it so happened, during the filming of this movie, a Nativity scene was needed. So...it was borrowed from the Civic Center display...with permission, by the way! Someone had forgotten to advice the powers that be, and it was reported stolen! A frantic search began with law enforcement for a few days. Finally, someone spoke up and remembered loaning it to the film crew in Georgetown! It was returned and put back where it belonged! As it turns out...it wasn't featured all that much in the movie...you can barely see it during the Christmas show with the children. It did create quit a disturbance though...",positive

"Once I heard that the greatest and oldest preserved Germanic heroic poem was transformed into a film it almost became my obsession to see it. The first glints of its appearance I caught never disappointed me. A futuristic interpretation With Lambert our favourite highlander and Mitra, tomb raider to be,in leading roles seamed appealing, though some doubts came to life (an important female character in Beowulf?)... Two hours ago I saw the film. After I had read the director's name my world fell apart. As I said - from that point on, there was not many surprises. First and foremost, the film has NOTHING to do with the original Beowulf if we disregard a couple of violently and pointlessly stolen names. If they had not stolen the names and declared it to be a new story, it might have passed as an f-class action stupidity with nice costumes and scenography. This way it is simply a crime! An attack on a legend and its ideology as well as on common sense. Ok let me be positive for a second... apart from the general electro-goth atmosphere which is nice it also has good music.

"I love oddball animation, I love a lot of Asian films, but I didn't love this particular product of Japan. The Fuccons are supposedly an American family (they're all mannequins) who have moved to Japan, and they're somewhat a 50's sitcom type family, with slightly more modern sensibilities at times. The DVD features several very short episodes (like less than 5 minutes each?) and I did not find it to be either funny or entertaining, not even in a weird way. I'm not sure what the appeal is of this. I did pick up on some satire here and there, gosh, who wouldn't, but satire is usually somewhat humorous, isn't it? And nothing I saw or heard rated even a little smirk. I picked this up used and it certainly SOUNDED appealing, but I guess either I'm missing the point or it's just plain LAME. The box even says it's Fuccon hilarious, right there on the front, but I beg to differ. 2 out of 10.",negative
"I watched this film post-Endgame, so my familiarity with Captain Marvel was at a bare minimum going into it--at least in terms of the Carol Danvers version (The original Captain Marvel dates back to the dawn of the comic book age and was actually the character of Shazam. Through a fascinating roller coaster of events, Marvel ended up with the rights to the name of Captain Marvel, while DC kept the rights to the actual character.)  As the movie progressed through ""Vers"" trying to discover her identity, I found myself just as confused as the character as to who she was and the powers she was able to wield.  While they attempt to rectify this, by the end of the film, we don't really know a heck of a lot more than we did when it started.  Carol Danvers the Air Force Pilot and Carol Danvers the Ultra-Powerful Superhero still feel like two different characters at the end.  It also feels like Captain Marvel was not in the original plans for the MCU, and instead feels tacked on (whether or not that's true, I don't know).  This was my issue with Captain Marvel in Endgame as she didn't feel like an organic extension of The Avengers.  Captain Marvel may not have warranted the hate that some of her most vocal critics have lobbed at her, but she's also not the feminist messiah her most ardent supporters have crowned her as either.

"I was a little concerned going into opening weekend because of people trashing the movie before it came out. I had invited co-workers to watch it with me, and was nervous that it might be bad. It wasn't. There's plenty to enjoy here. We had a great time. It's not my favorite Marvel movie, but it certainly isn't the worst. I think the people who prejudged the movie based their complaints on other movies, or ideas about what this movie was supposed to be, or what the character was supposed to be, or what this female character should be like compared to all the other female characters out there. If you can leave all that at the door, you might just enjoy this movie. I'd give it a B- as a Marvel movie. Legitimate critiques are that it doesn't have the styling of some of the great Marvel movies and that it suffers pacing issues at times.",negative
"If you're one of those who recognise with pleasure such arcane titles as 'Book of the Dead', 'Book of Eibon' or 'Necronomicon', then you should feel right at home with Malefique, a film which also features an occult tome, one with the power to change the destinies of all involved. Discovered by four French prisoners sharing a cell, the fearsome object has been placed in the wall there by Danvers, a serial killer incarcerated back in the 1920s; a man obsessed with rejuvenation and the black arts before he abruptly vanished. Finders of the book are Carrère (Gérald Laroche) a company embezzler shopped by his wife, Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) who aspires to be a woman but at the same time body-builds to execute an escape plan, the halfwit Pâquerette (Dimitri Rataud) who once ate his baby sister, and the 'librarian' Marcus (Clovis Cornillac), supposedly driven mad by reading, who murdered his wife. Reminding the viewer of Meat Loaf's equally bizarre, bosomy male in Fight Club (1999), Lassalle begins as the dominant member of the quartet, one who is especially protective of the infantile Pâquerette. With the coming of the book however, and the overarching need to decipher its dangerous contents, Marcus assumes greater and greater significance. At first assured of an early bail, meanwhile Carrère takes little more than academic interest in events. Suddenly he too needs an urgent escape option and, as the prisoners experiment, Danvers' book starts to reveal some of its terrifying powers...<br /><br />Staged for the most part within a prison cell, and between four or five characters, Malefique has a claustrophobic air entirely suited to its subject matter (as well as the limited budget of the filmmakers). Only at the start and then at the conclusion do we get to leave the confines of the cell, a necessary opening out which only serves to emphasise the doomed, closed-in nature of proceedings elsewhere. More than anything, this is a film about being trapped, either as a victim of your criminal past or of occult events now unfolding. ""I'm going to escape,"" says Carrère at the start of the film, wishing more than anything to be able to rejoin his wife and son. Whether or not he does it will be at a terrible price, and the great irony of the film is that the ultimate form of an 'escape' may not be one a man might imagine.<br /><br />With all its budget limitations it is greatly to the first-time feature director Eric Vallette's credit that his film succeeds as well as it does. As critics have noticed, it is a film with strong Freudian overtones - Lassalle's distinctive mammaries and adult breast feeding for instance; the picture of a vagina which comes to life and develops an eye; the grown man who dissolves back into a foetus; Danvers' original placenta fetish; the dark cell as a primitive womb from which 'delivery' is awaited, etc. With so many interesting aspects to the script Vallette hardly puts a foot wrong, and he succeeds in creating a genuinely unsettling atmosphere out of what, when one comes down to it, is just a matter of four guys, four bunks, one folding table and a book. There's a genuine, growing, Lovecraftian frisson as the men summon up the unnameable darkness from within its pages, while one or two moments - the aforementioned blinking vagina, or what ultimately happens to Pâquerette - are unsettlingly memorable. The pacing of many of the dark events in Malefique is deliberate, rejecting the rapid cutting of many Hollywood productions: a video culture approach that often subverts the horrified gaze in favour of quick-fix action and gore. Perhaps this is a particularly European manner, as one recalls a similar, measured approach to shocking hallucination taken in such films as Verhoeven's The Fourth Man (1983) - a film that incidentally also shares a particularly nasty image based around a prolapsed eye.<br /><br />Lensed well in 1.85:1, Malefique benefits from excellent performances and, if for this viewer at least, the conclusion was not as explainable as it might have been, the journey to the final shot was worth taking. Coming so soon after the release of the similarly well-received Haute Tension (aka: Switchblade Romance, 2003), this is another reason to be grateful that good horror films are once again emerging from the French industry, this after a time when it seemed the only worthwhile product came from Asia",positive
"Father of the Pride was the best new show to hit television since Family Guy. It was yet another masterpiece from the talented people at Dreamworks Animation. Like The Simpsons, the show centers around a nuclear family (of white lions, in this case). It also contains many memorable supporting characters including Roger the surly orangutan, Vincent the Italian-American flamingo, the eccentric white tigers Blake and Victoria, the faux patriotic Snout Brothers and Chutney the elephant. The other stars of the show are the Sigfreid and Roy. They are incredibly eccentric and do everything in a grandiose manner, making the most mundane activities entertaining. The combination of cute animal characters with very adult dialog and controversial issues (drugs, prejudice, etc) is the source of the program's brilliance.<br /><br />The blame for this show's failure lies with NBC. They opted to broadcast the episodes in no particular order (perhaps being influenced by which guest stars they could promote) rather than the more logical production order. Several times, the show was preempted for an extra half-hour of such dreck as The Biggest Loser (as if 60 minutes of that was not enough)! It is indeed an ill omen for the future of television as art if an original and daring show like this fails while Fear Factor and American Idol dominate.<br /><br />Luckily, the complete series was released on DVD and the show now has an opportunity to gain a larger following. 10/10",positive
"A good movie on its' own, and in the Marvel Universe, this action superhero is in 1989 and 1995, the days of Blockbuster and emerging new fighter aircraft.

"This movie had NO natural character development, Brie Larson failed to bring this character to life in everyway. The humor was led by Samuel Jackson and others. This movie also has raised more questions than anything else. by making Captain marvel essentially the true first avenger as the story did they have put into question almost everything that we thought we knew about the MCU for the last 11 years. We can't even talk about how they failed to show a comic worthy original adaptation, the entire script was bad and the story has twisted comics heavily! They made the skrulls good guys, WTF everybody knows the skrulls envade Earth and have heavy issues with the Avengers and also largely with the Fantastic Four! This is what leads to Super Skrulls! That's just a few things that went terribly wrong. Brie Larson fails to give us the grit and emotion needed to sell a rushed story like this. I could go on and on but all I can say is that this was a really bad movie and not worthy to stand aside the other MCU films. I honestly believe Brie Larson's Captain Marvel will hurt the Avengers Endgame Movie.....if this movie is what prices together the MCU's past and is the sole reason for Nick Fury wanting to form the Avengers then we where better off not knowing! They should have just went straight to Endgame and waited another year to even bother with Captain Marvel",negative

"In an early scene, Luca (David Pasquesi) and James (Jeff Garlin) are walking down a neighborhood street in Chicago, admiring the bucolic architecture, when a woman, angrily arguing in French on a cell phone, passes by them, prompting James to remark, ""There's nothing hotter than an angry French woman."" A few blocks later, they pass an old Filipino woman, also angry, also arguing on a cell phone, and Luca remarks, for referential effect, ""There's nothing hotter than an angry, elderly Filipino woman.""<br /><br />The humor in Jeff Garlin's I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With is best characterized by the word quotidian. The film is a conversation. We might as well be eavesdropping. Rather than go for antics, the film relies on character flaws and human curiosity to deliver laughs. While it's not innovative, it is far from banal, and even if James views himself as being rather jejune, we know that he is fairly average, and this endears him.<br /><br />Self-betterment is the primary theme of the movie. Sarah Silverman, who plays Beth, is excellent as the catalyst of change; she revitalizes James, and so reminds him to live a better life. Even so, achieving some idyllic dream is not the end of these characters, but rather something simpler: that they might pick up what pieces there are of the life they love, just to keep for themselves at least enough to carry on.<br /><br />A movie about life lessons can be overwrought, as it can forget to connect with its audience. I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With is subtle and winsome, and while its moral may not be inspiring, it is still resonant. This is low-key comedy, but it will stick with you.",positive
"Captain Marvel was an entertaining addition to the MCU. However, although fun at certain points, it never got me to fully invest in or be inspired by the main character, Carol. With that, there were various things that were inconsistent with the continuity in the MCU, particularly stemming from various things said leading up to and within the first Avengers film. Now, I understand that the MCU is massive and can be confusing all in one bite. However, it's not to the point where ignorance of continuity is excusable, especially from one of their most popular installments. Aside from that, however, the movie itself fails to find a pace or style that really captivates you and stand out from the rest. Also, as talented as some of these actors/actresses are, none of them do an outstanding job at their role, which is disappointing because some of these individuals have very good track records, particularly Brie Larson, who never really seemed to lock-in the Captain Marvel character well, probably due to direction mishaps, but I digress.nnOverall, as much ""fun"" as this movie can be, it's not traditional MCU quality and I feel that it did more of a disservice to the universe more than anything. However, I am excited to see this character in Endgame and the Stan Lee cameo was incredible, so it at least gets a passing grade, but I will certainly not be paying to see it again.",negative
"This movie is hilarious, bright and insightful. Though perhaps the story would work well involving almost any ethnic group, the inherent Jewishness of the characters gives extra meaning to the bounty of wonderful dialog. There were so many social issues covered in the plot that for that reason alone it would have been worth seeing; -but the real treasure was in the warm laughter that spread throughout the appreciative audience. The medley of complex characters with their various strengths and weaknesses play out their roles with all the pathos and humor one would expect from the Shakespearean drama their lives seem to parody. This is a film about family; - about the often fragile, sometimes invisible binding together of diverse personalities and lifestyles, first among siblings and parents, and inevitably among the larger family of friends and even strangers. The technical aspects of the film have given the movie a pace and development that keep the viewer intrigued until the final scene. Peter Falk is amazing, as always, in his role as family patriarch Morris Applebaum. Strong performances by a fine cast include a surprise guest. Don't miss this movie!",positive

"Very disappointing. Captain Marvel was supposed to inspire women as the first female character in the MCU to get a solo film, but that is not what happened. The movie about as safe, boring, predictable, and bland as MCU movies get. The editing and writing are both bad. The special effects, while not as terrible as black panther's final fight scene, is bad compared to all the other mcu movies before it. Bri larson does not fit the role. Her acting range is that of a stick. The entire point of the movie is to establish Carol as a character, but they give her no personality. I nor no one I know can name a single personality trait she has. Every MCU movie I've seen the theater is always filled with laughter or a reaction at all from the audience, but in this one the audience was dead silent the entire time. The theater was packed and I did not nor did anyone else laugh once. They failed to fix her character problem in endgame where she is one of the worst things about the movie, but i hope they can fix it in future films, or maybe even replace Bri Larson with an actor who actually has skill. I wanted to like Carol and her solo film, but I came out of the theater hating the character and the movie.",negative
"Disappointing. Very disappointing. I expected much from Captain Marvel, and though it certainly had its moments and aspects of excellence, the film flattered to deceive both in context of the MCU and as a standalone film. It felt like a Marvel Phase 1 film, but without the naive brilliance of Iron Man 1 or Captain America The First Avenger. It felt more like Thor the Dark World in terms of quality, and almost DC-like in terms of its treatment of the source material. Quite frankly, the treatment of one of Marvel Comics' most heralded antagonist groups, the Skrulls, is unforgivable, and the writing of the eponymous character left a lot to be desired, which is a shame for Brie Larsson who was a lot better in Endgame despite her short air time. Before I elaborate, I want to be clear, these are ***SPOILERS*** so only read on if you have seen Captain Marvel.nnThe Skrulls are major antagonists in Marvel lore. The Kree-Skrull war is well known to even casual comic readers, to the extent that only one portrayal of the Skrulls would have reasonably been expected: Evil. That they spent half the film depicting the Skrulls as bad, only to pivot the storyline rather abruptly is all the more galling, in that it felt as though they were getting the right treatment, only to have that rug pulled unceremoniously. Pandering to the increasingly PC brigade, and in what can only be described as an attempt to capitalise on populist rhetoric at the moment, the Skrulls were shown to be refugees seeking asylum, rather than the shapeshifting infiltrators who have brought down entire worlds in the comics. Whilst Ben Mendelsohn's Talos was arguably a film highlight, that does little to paper over the cracks of what felt like odious puffery to lefty commentators seeking more inclusion and diversity. This can technically be salvaged, if Talos and his renegade group of refugees are shown to be a small group of separatists, breaking away from the more common deceptive Skrulls, however if anyone as seen Spider Man: Far From Home, hope for that might be lost.nnCaptain Marvel herself was also very poorly written. In her scenes with Yon-Rogg (Jude Law), she is lambasted for apparently being too emotional, whilst appearing utterly devoid of it. As a trope, it makes sense, and it is clear that the Kree do not want her to fully repair her faculties which are linked to emotion. However, they write the words without then writing her character with any emotion at all. They make her totally robotic and wooden, and this is far more an issue of script writing than performance as where the script lent itself to emotion, Brie excelled. She had few moments to shine, but her performances opposite Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury, Lashana Lynch's Maria Rambeau and Akira Akbar's Monica Rambeau were emotional, warm, funny, and otherwise engaging. So, it is clearly not an issue with Brie Larsson as an actor, and much to do with poor scriptwriting. nnI haven't even talked about how ridiculously overpowered Captain Marvel was in the film. I could almost write an essay about how much of a plot hole that is, but in all honestly, if you have seen Endgame, you will see how much of an issue it creates. Captain Marvel barely features at all, because if she did, there would simply be no Endgame - she would end it in 2 minutes. Once she goes binary, she is impervious, all powerful, and completely infallible. Its not like there is an off switch, a weakening agent, or a time limit on how long she can stay binary. Once she achieves it, she can just plough through absolutely anything. How can any character possess that kind of power and be interesting?! nnHonestly, it was disappointing on so many levels, but I would like to point out that Nick Fury is a massive highlight, as was seeing Phil Coulson again on screen. There were great scenes between Fury and Danvers, but overall, the film let me down in a way no Marvel film has done since Thor Dark World. As much as I felt Black Panther was overrated and rather poor on the whole, this was a new level. More holes than swiss cheese, and I cannot see how they plan to bring this character back to some kind of believability. Even Superman had Kryptonite. Perhaps they wish to use her to battle galactic forces like Galactus, but it will start veering towards ridiculousness and will ultimately lose the audience as CGI will take over and practical effects become impossible.nnBy all means watch the film, you have to if you are a Marvel fan, but don't way i didn't warn you.",negative

"Well first off the fact that they didn't even follow the story of the comics where Monica Rambeau was the second, Mar-Vell is the first Captain Marvel. Carol is the 7th Captain Marvel character and they made her the first? Such dumb scenes especially with Fury (SPOILER) Losing his eye to a cat/Flerken, which is basically Kirby in cat form. Now all this aside if there was an actual good story line and flow to the movie it probably would have been good, but the fact that all it was was people saying no you can't do that and her saying yes I can was lazy writing. Every hero goes through ups and downs to Humanize them so they can resonate with the audience, or at least be an inspiration to everyone, there is nothing inspiring about Captain Marvel, i would rather watch all Twilight movies then this sorry excuse for a ""movie"".",negative

"I saw this film much like Skywalker02 did, but when I could manage to see it again and with formal film training, psychology, and life has had the time to really take me by the hand and start beating me about,..I really click with the film. I remember the pay for service cable channels played this thing almost to death, much like poltergeist when it first came out, and many other popular films. I felt back then it wasn't worth the fuss and constant ""airtime"" (I know cable isn't really on air) given it, but I was very young and adult situation drama wouldn't have and shouldn't have worked. However, recent viewing of the film has enlightened me on the film. I think that Susan Surandon and Molly Ringwald were likely studying the script together, and I would be a bit surprised if Surandon had coached Ringwald during this project. Ringwald's other projects, while good, do not have her exhibiting the potential depth as this role. Surandon nailed hers, as Raul Julia did also. Cassavettes and wife delivered acceptable performances, but I will admit at times first class acting turns to mediocre. A steady ebb and flow to the acting does take place during many scenes, but overall I can see why the story might call for the dynamic to become more subtle.<br /><br />All in all, I don't find this film to be the ""take me out and drown me"" kind of boredom fest as Skywalker02 would have you believe. I think that perhaps with the right psychological training and a bit more hardship in one's domestic life strategically placed, coupled with some film courses perhaps this film would appear different. I would say if you are feeling a bit melancholy and yearn for a simpler life, and you have had your share of marital discord amongst dysfunctional family units, then perhaps this film might provide more insight and entertainment than you might think. I do feel it is a classic and find it much more entertaining than mainstream films that are supposed to share many of the same elements, such as Terms of Endearment which as far as I am concerned could be stripped of a few extraordinary performances by Jack Nicholson, then ceremoniously burned until nothing is left. (How could a film like that get more attention than this one. Talk about boredom.)Best thing, don't take my word or anyone else's, see the film and support our industry.",positive

"""Silverlake Life"" is a documentary and it was plain and straightforward. Actually, it was more like a home movie, and if you want dramatic illuminations, see something else. And it's by no means a tearjerker. But I mean that in positive ways. It shows two men who love each other and how being afflicted with AIDS is affecting the quality of their every-day lives. It's almost difficult for me to say whether this was a quality film or not, because it was so undressed that I had to look for other ways to respond. It's an admirable film, actually one of the most admirable, sincere documents I've ever seen. These two men have incredible integrity as their lives are reduced to the most basic parts. It makes Hollow-wood productions on AIDS seem hip and heartless. These men made this movie for themselves, which is one of the best reasons to create something. The scene where Tom sings ""You are My Sunshine"" to Mark and tells him goodbye is the real thing.",positive

"I was so looking forward to this, but the film was disappointing. Poor story arc, wooden acting and plot holes everywhere. It's sad that there was so much hype, because the character deserved a much better story. It has nothing to do that the central character is a woman (I loved the Wonder Woman movie) and it has nothing to do with empowerment of people of colour (I adore the Black Panther movie!) It's just that Captain Marvel has no pathos, no humanity. Brie Larson may be an acclaimed actor but in this she is wooden and lacking anything akin to any emotion. SPOILERS....... The story itself doesn't explain why or how these powers work, any vulnerabilities or why she is fighting along side the Kree. The Skrulls are a nice twist, but Ronan's character is a cardboard cut out. Every chance the film gets to vilify men and for Larson's character to beat up men is used. Jude Law's character is every male chauvinistic arch stereotype amalgamation. There is no struggle in Larson's character to reconnect with her humanity. Sure, there are some flashbacks and some nice memory reviews with her old flying buddy and her buddy's daughter, but there is no true reconnect with that humanity. Not even a struggle. It's just so hard to connect with the character! Captain Marvel has no rage or anger at the Kree even after she discovers her life has been a lie and they imprisoned her power and used her as a weapon. In the final battle screen she shows little emotion in her want to protect earth. Sure, she does it decisively but there is no passion. It is just phoned in. I think that there were three things that severely disengaged the audience. The first being how the story was written. Second perhaps is the directing ques that Captain Marvel is mind altered and brainwashed by the Kree so she is just a soldier puppet. But this could have been a great strong story arc tool to demonstrate her battle between her resurfacing humanity and struggling to keep control Kree side. But Larson played it safe and was so stiff and devoid of anything resembling emotion she might as well been a Vulcan/Kree. It was contrived, politically overbearing and the limited character development meant that the audience had a very hard time investing in and connecting with the main protagonist character! The cat was good. ",negative

"As a big fan of Brian Yuzna and the majority of the movies he's been involved in, I guessed I'd enjoy Progeny. I didn't, although in ways it has it's moments. However, if you're expecting something of the calibre of Society or Beyond ReAnimator, you could be in for a shock. In a way this is similar to Society, being a tale of a seemingly ordinary world with a horrific supernatural underbelly...but that's where it ends.<br /><br />I'm not covering for Yuzna when I say that the fault doesn't really lie with him, as bad direction is bad direction, but the direction is sound. What trips the movie up is both script and acting. Stuart Gordon (ReAnimator, Dagon) has written an intelligent script, but one that doesn't really work with Yuzna's style of direction, leaving him paused on actors delivering lengthy dialogue when really he wants to throw that camera around and get down with his bad self. This matter makes the movie awkward enough as it is, but there's worse.<br /><br />If the movie had been made with great actors, the movie would have probably held it's own. Unfortunately this is very far from the case. The acting is wooden, shockingly so even for a low-budget B feature. The inexplicably successful and renowned Arnold Vosloo wrecks every damn line with near pinpoint precision, handing in one of the worst performances I've seen in a long while. The man manages to turn every line of well considered dialogue into the kind of ham-line you'll be throwing drunkenly at mates next time you're in the pub. 'Hey Bob! GOOD GOD, AM I GOING MAD! WHAT'S...COME OVER ME! NOOOO!' In fact I may try that one myself next weekend. The last minute addition of genre veteran (and personal favourite) Brad Dourif, instead of enriching the film like it should, almost seems to hand Dourif the movie in a last ditch effort to stop Vosloo from hamming, but quite frankly Dourif looks deeply uncomfortable (possibly waiting for the next assault of bad acting) next to Vosloo, and even an eccentric turn from him fails to resuscitate the film.<br /><br />If the acting was better, this movie would have been okay. Hell, it might have been pretty enjoyable, but the lack of character makes the movie a soulless affair, and makes the horror element seem tacked on and tasteless instead of an organic part of the film. I found the alien torture/rape scenes a little difficult to stomach already, but the fact that the characters were so lacking made them seem gratuitous as well as unpleasant, leaving a nasty taste in the mouth.<br /><br />So, if you really like Sci-fi and don't have a problem with bad acting, pedestrian pacing and a really garish, nasty rape scene, Progeny will probably be your cup of tea. But since I do, I'm probably never going to watch it again. Once was enough. On the plus side, this is the only Sci-Fi movie Yuzna ever bothered to make, so he obviously wasn't really that pleased with it himself.",negative
The movie was awful. At best it's mediocre at worst it's just bad. The radical flashbacks between present day and  past were initially jarring. The cinematography was dull and the references to 90's internet and music felt cheap and hollow. The scenes were meandering and dull with bland fights. Captain Marvel is so strong she doesn't have much of a threat in the villains who feel like nameless extras. Even the final battle is pretty lackluster.  On the positives the Skrull were fun villains. Nick Fury carried every scene he was in and Goose was a really cute cat.,negative

"The most frustrating thing about Captain Marvel is that there was a good movie in there - but it had too much going (amnesia movie, link to MCUs past, origin story, setting up Endgame) on that underserved  the story - nothing was allowed to breath. It's not like this film was moving at a breakneck pace either - events were just responded to briefly (if at all) and an ""okay, next"" kind of attitude - and that was a huge disservice to the film. There are moments which should hit hard, but don't because we don't spend time with the characters enough or focus on how they make Carol Danvers feel. Brie Larsons performance was really good - but if they let things have the moment they should have, she would have been even better (she's a great actress in my opinion, they shoulda utilized her more). There are other issues, but I don't want to spoil the film. All that withstanding though, there are some good things. The buddy-cop dynamic with Larson and Jackson is the best part of the film, the supporting cast (especially Ben Mendelsohn) are all solid, and the action is enjoyable. Far from the best of the MCU - but certainly not the worst. I'd like to see a second CM that could iron out these issues.",positive
"A lot has already been said on this movie and I' d like to join those who praised it. It's a highly unique film which uses elements of different genres: drama, comedy, gangster film without making a mess of it. At points you just laugh out loud, at other points you feel for the characters whose mistakes and failures you watch. Sabu's genius can be shown with regard to some sequences of the movie. One is that where all three men chasing one another have an erotic day dream about a young woman that they just passed by on the street. This sequence is beautifully done and illustrates the characters of all three runners very well. It is erotic and funny at the same time. Another example of Sabu's genius is the part of the film where the runners get tired. First one of them, the typical loser among the three guys, hallucinates that the woman that left him for someone else is back again and you see them dancing with one another and in the next shot him dancing with himself which is deeply moving. All of the runners get to this point where they think that have something back they lost or are on track again. And at one part of the movie they stop chasing each other, running in line, just laughing.So here is it all the beauty and the ludicrousness of what we call life which Sabu manages to show throughout the film. His characters fail (do they at the end?) but he doesn't rob them of their dignity. ""Monday"" and ""Postman Blues"" that do justice to Sabu's claim that he is a genius. Go watch them!<br /><br />",positive

Without giving too much away, we learn things that (one) nobody was asking for, and (two) the answers are more of a disservice and disrespectful to fans of both the comics and MCU as a whole. The source of Captain Marvel's power seems to break the timeline of an important item in the MCU and there's little to no character arc in her story. This would have been a great movie if it was by itself. But because of it's influence on a greater universe of connected movies, it made me more upset at betrayed than entertained.",controversial

"The most satisfying element about ""Dan in Real Life"" is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) makes sense and is beautifully realistic. The casting of Oscar-winner Juliette Binoche as Dan's love interest was a superb decision; she is exceptionally talented, intelligent, naturally attractive and, thank goodness, appropriately aged for the part! Had this movie been made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would have been a disaster.<br /><br />Another wonderful aspect about ""Dan in Real Life"" is that it is a perfect film for adults who are interested in a mature comedy that leaves out the three pillars of the ""frat pack"" formula: dumb chicks, chauvinistic guys, and sleazy jokes. ""Dan in Real Life"" is witty and has fun, intelligent laughs throughout. Whereas other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience into laughing, the jokes from ""Dan in Real Life"" are more natural and clever, and involve some thinking on the part of the audience.<br /><br />My only problem with ""Dan in Real Life"" is that the rebellious, middle daughter is played too outrageously by actress Brittany Robertson. It's difficult to say if this was a personal choice on her part or a choice by the director. Either way, her character is unrealistic and annoying. But, this is only a minor flaw in the film, and does not take away from the story as a whole.<br /><br />All in all, ""Dan in Real Life"" is a great film, a fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and dumbed-down comedies. The quality of the writing, directing, acting, and (especially) cinematography is excellent. It is simply a beautiful, light-hearted comedy.",positive

The story is a mess, with so many issues that don't make sense. Also Brie is very bland in this. Most of the MCU cast have put in strong performances since the first movie and she fails to live up to the lowest bar. nnAlso, I understand that Nick Fury in this movie is 'young' but they have made him this, comic relief character who loses his eye to an alien cat because it scratched him. Nick Fury is a badass. There are 100s of amazing things you could have done with meaning and depth instead of this. Good job.nnI'm not bothered too much by the empowering scenes for women in this. At points they do seem forced but they are in the 70s, 80s and 90s I think? nnI liked the Skrulls but thought the Kree were, meh. Illogical and dumb. I want smart, well written villains. At the end of the movie, it would have been much better if Captain Marvel beat Jude Laws character in a fist fight rather than the blast. It would have been more impressive. nnActually, one thing with the Skrulls I didn't like was their plan. They are willing to sacrifice 100s-1000s of their kind, to find a few dozen, by hopefully luring the Kree to the planet their on, and hopefully they bring Captain Marvel, and HOPEFULLY she gets separated and they can hopefully capture her. Also hopefully they can find info they need. nnHonestly, some funny 90s jokes here and there but not enough for me to actually say this is a good movie. When a movie or series has a character who learns nothing throughout the movie, acts like they know everything and seems to, just because, and remains almost emotionless throughout and is depicted poorly due to bad acting.. its not a good movie/series. Captain Marvel is an excellent character. She is strong and a symbol. She still has to learn things along the way. Everyone does. I also want to say, naming the Avengers after her is just so so dumb and all that B.S with the Tesseract was somewhat nonsensical. ",positive

It's a shame, because, as others have posted, the sets & costumes were great.<br /><br />The sound track was typical ""asian-style"" music, although I couldn't figure out where the ""modern"" love song came in when Fernando was lying in his bed thinking of Maria.

Oh, so painfully sad. Lines delivered like a bad junior high play. If Gary Stretch had donned a potato costume for the County 4H Fair he may have been more believable.

"When I was 8 years old, and going through my Marx Brothers phase, my father read in the TV Guide that they were showing the Marx Brothers film, ""The Big Store"" late on Friday night, and set the VCR to tape it for me. When I woke up on Saturday -- due no doubt to a misprint in the TV guide -- my father and I discovered ""The Story of Mankind"" had been recorded instead.<br /><br />""The Big Store"" was probably one of the least funny of all the Marx Brothers movies and nevertheless it stands as one of the century's finest works of cinema when compared with ""The Story of Mankind."" I can almost justify TV Guide's error, in that the Marx Brothers -- Groucho, Chico, and Harpo -- appear in both movies. Although in ""The Story of Mankind,"" they are divided up into a series of unrelated scenes: Groucho plays Peter Minuit, Chico plays some guy talking to Christopher Columbus, and Harpo plays Isaac Newton????? Harpo's scene lasts about half a minute; Chico only has two or three lines; Groucho's scene is at least funny, but horribly racially insensitive by today's standards. The rest of the movie doesn't bear mentioning. They trotted out some of the finest actors of the day, and made them recite total garbage. What a disappointment.<br /><br />TV Guide, I sent you a nice letter, I'm still waiting for an apology.<br /><br />For the record: ""The Big Store"" has a wonderful bit of physical comedy with the Marx Brothers on roller skates, and a couple of songs by Virginia O'Brien.

As a marvel fanatic this movie did not disappoint. Overall great movie!,positive
"I had been really looking forward to this movie and all the hype it was being given. It was about time marvel gave us a female super hero. But I was left feeling a bit disappointed.  Carol Danvers herself made me mad in a way. Her attitude seemed a bit pretentious and wasn't really what I had been hoping for. Ever since I was a little girl watching the cartoon Avengers Assemble I loved and looked up to the female super heroes. I thought (and still do) that Black Widow was the coolest chick, now this includes Gamora and Nebula who I love. The female heroes in both Marvel and DC movies where always people I looked up to and wanted to be like. But with Captain Marvel I didn't really get that vibe, yes she is insanely strong and independent, but in some of the interactions she just seemed to talk down to those around her and that just rubbed me the wrong way and really made it hard for me to connect and relate to her in the same way I did with other female heroes. nnAnother issue I had with the film was that it contradicted a lot of things that had been said in previous marvel films. Such as Nick Fury referring to S.H.I.E.L.D as Shield, when in Iron Man they had yet to shorten their name until the end of the movie. And the fact that (if i am not mistaken) in Thor and The Avengers Coulson makes it seem as though Thor and Loki where the first interactions with Aliens they had, but this movie directly contradicts that. nThings like this made it seem as though the movie wasn't as well thought out in my opinion. It made it seem as though they where tying to really force the idea that Captain Marvel was very very important. nnThat being said I did in fact enjoy quite a bit of the story. Fury was hilarious along with the Skrull leader. They where the funniest/best parts of the film for me. Along with Goose the cat. I liked the references to Guardians of the Galaxy with Ronan before he goes rouge. nI believe Captain Marvel could have been a great movie, but for me I felt as though it was bordering just okay.",positive

"It's a bad movie that shouldn't have been made, but not for anit-capitalism, SJW or diversity reasons. The people complaining about those are incels and nationalists. No, the movie is bad because it destroys what the whole saga was built upon. It's like the director heard people complaining that TFA was too ""samey"" so he went in the TOTALLY opposite direction which had immense consequences. I do not recommend it.",controversial
This is not the stuff of soap-operas but the sort of conundrums that real people face in real life. A testament to the ensemble and director for the powerful story-telling of fallible characters trying to cope but not quite succeeding.,positive
"I can't believe I rarely ever see this title mentioned by all you eighties horror freaks and I definitely won't be joining all my fellow reviewers here in saying that 'Bloody Birthday' is awful viewing. On the contrary, I enjoyed it very much and I was pleasantly surprised by the ingeniousness and surprise twists it offers. Don't just refer to this film as being 'another 80's slasher' because the victims here are rather unlikely and so are the killers. We're introduced to three cherubic-looking youngsters who were all born during a solar eclipse. At the moment they were delivered, planet Saturn was blocked by both the sun and the moon and, due to this, the kids are emotionless and seemly without conscience. This really starts to show around their tenth birthday as they go on a merciless killing spree.<br /><br />Granted, this stuff is incredibility far-fetched and even slightly offensive but, seriously, who cares? Unlike many other horror films from this period, it at least attempts to bring something original and imaginative. For once, the kids' acting is good and the entire film has a creepy atmosphere and grizzly music. The murders sequences are grim and tense, and it's always eerie to see them getting committed by angel-faced kids. I don't know who hired the 3 kids but they did a good job. Especially the girl and the kid with glasses are highly memorable. The bleak images of the heartless trio remind you of classic highlights, such as 'Village of the Damned', 'The Bad Seed' and 'Children of the Damned'. This film is nowhere near as memorable as these milestones but great fun and not one horror lover will regret watching this. <br /><br />Bloody Birthday was written and directed by Ed Hunt. Not particularly the greatest genius in cinema, but a pleasantly deranged fella who also brought us immensely entertaining cheesefests like 'The Brain' and 'Starship Invasions'. If all this isn't enough to convince you yet, Bloody Birthday has a lot of nudity. And not just any nudity, but a topless dance-act by MTV-VJ Julie Brown. Oh, and keep your eyes open for a completely redundant cameo by Joe Penny, later the star of TV-series 'Jake and the Fatman'. Check it out!!",positive

"Expertly done from plot to tone. Brie Larson superbly leads a charismatic ensemble, with a tale that is engaging from start to finish. It doesn't take itself too seriously and maintains a strong message, all the while avoiding becoming cliche. The chemistry between Larsen and Samuel L. Jackson is endearing. There is no shortage of strong female players in this film from the lead to supporting parts, including Larsen/Marvel's best friend played by Lashana Lynch. Even the animals steal some scenes! What is most admirable is that the main character has strength and confidence all her own. A thoughtful piece of work as part of the Marvel Universe, but more importantly solely as a stand-alone film. Even if you don't follow any superhero films, as I don't, you may still find this an entertaining and refreshing watch. Thoroughly enjoyed it!",positive

"Dr. McCoy and Mr. Spock find themselves trapped in a planet's past Ice Age, while Capt. Kirk is in the same planet's colonial period. However, it's the former pair that has the most trying time. Besides the freezing temperatures and sanctuary to be found only in caves, there is a third inhabitant, the beautiful and so sexy Zarabeth (Mariette Hartley). As Spock spends more time in this era, he slowly begins to revert to the behavioral patterns of his ancestors, feeling a natural attraction to Zarabeth and throwing ""caution to the wind"" about ever leaving this place. Only with Dr. McCoy's constant ""reminders"" does Spock hold on to some grasp of reality.<br /><br />This stand as one of the few times when the character gets to show some ""emotion"" and Nimoy (Spock) plays it to the hilt, coming close to knocking the bejesus out of Deforest Kelly (McCoy). Surprising to previous installment, Captain Kirk (William Shatner) wasn't allowed to get the girl, another plus for this one.<br /><br />Perennial ""old man"" Ian Wolfe assays the role of ""Mr. Atoz,"" the librarian responsible for sending the trio into the past.",positive
"A very fine new addition to the Marvel universe. In short: Captain Marvel is simply Marvelous! It's got lots of humor, way more than the usual Marvel comic/movie which fills in the times between the action scenes a lot better. With its twists and turns in its story it is a nice mix between life here on planet Earth, planet Kree and other spaces in space! I enjoyed it very much, though there were loads of logical errors which are surely disturbing to the more fervent and observant movie-goer. Still I give it 7 1/2 out of 10 points",positive
"Pure schlock from beginning to end. The average 12 year old might find that it has an interesting take on discrimination. Otherwise, it's a pure camp-fest endurance test.

"Brie larsons potyral of captain marvel was while at times very good in moments at potraying the strong i am female hear me roar type. The overall performance was lackluster with her rebel attitude and comedic one liners left much to be desired. Her role seemed to be written and picked for more of agenda born out of political correctness then what was best for the movie and marvel universe. Thats not to say a woman is not right for the captain marvel role, just not the one in which they picked. As for the movie itself, was slow and boring, the action sequences seemed to almost be an after thought which in turn left you feeling unsatisfied. They couldve and shouldve learned a lot as to what a strong female superhero could be from wonder woman but unfortunately they did not. The movie ultimately serves necessary to introduce a vital character moving forward in the marvel empire. But thats about it.

"Very, very humdrum movie fare here with Stella Stevens taking directions from someone in disguise(it didn't take me long to guess who it was) in Old Nevada Town outside Vegas for a money heist in the Circus Circus Hotel in Las Vegas. Stevens leads her girl gang of three, and they find out that they must act much quicker than had been anticipated. Despite some neat looks at Las Vegas in the 70's, very average yet credible acting from most involved, and a plot line with potential, Las Vegas Lady lays one big boring egg. It seems forever for the film to kick into gear,and when it does it just sputters here and there and never really speeds up. I was somewhat disappointed with this film. Sure, I wasn't expecting anything great, but I at least thought this might be one of those neat exploitation films from the 70's or something like it. Not even close. No one dies. There is a lame gunfight between creaky Stuart Whitman and officious George DiCenzo, one year prior to his grand performance as the prosecuting attorney Bugliosa in Helter Skelter. The gunfight has all the suspense of watching a waterfall. There is one punch and one head hit with a blunt instrument. Beyond that nothing in terms of action. And as for the girls, don't expect much there either. Stella and her girls(both very mediocre yet pretty talents, get in a sauna and a bath. What do we see? Nothing but a fleeting side profile. Stella wears these nice open blouses accentuating her real talents, but I wish she would have been a bit more open with her performance. That way I could write one thing that would recommend the film. Alas, it was not to be, and I have little to say in this film's favor. It isn't a horrible film in any way, it just has nothing going for it either. YAWN.",negative

I think their chemistry on camera is a direct result of their time together off camera. My favorite scene was by far (surprisingly so) Bret Ratner's piece... Without giving too much away, I'll just say that there is a surprise that leaves you hanging...<br /><br />The old couple were really good together and you actually got the impression that they had spent a lifetime together. <br /><br />Both the Chris Cooper and the Ethan Hawke segments packed a punch with surprises that seem realistic and similar to experiences that I've had in the big apple.

"I gather at least a few people watched it on Sept.2 on TCM. If you did you know that Hedy had to change her name to avoid being associated with this movie when she came the U.S. It was a huge scandal and I gather that the original release in the U.S. was so chopped up by censors that it was practically unintelligible. I watched because I had just seen a documentary on ""bad women"", actresses in the U.S. pre- movie censorship board set up in the early '30s. It looked to me as though they got away with a lot more than Hedy's most ""sensational"" shots in ""Ecstasy"". In fact Hedy looked positively innocent in this, by today's standards, and it was nice to see her early unspoiled beauty. It was a nice, lyrical movie to relax to. I loved it for what it was: a simple romance. I watched it after pre- recording it during a sleepless early A.M. I would love to see the first version released in the U.S. for comparison's sake.",positive

"These kind of movies where a psycho of one variety or another tries to damage the reputation (and eventually eliminate altogether) some naive person in order to take over their life. Fatal Attraction, Pacific Heights, The Hand that Rocks the Cradle, Single White Female, and a thousand made-for-TV movies are some examples of this. But while a few, especially Fatal Attraction and Pacific Heights could offer at least some extremely paranoid, suspenseful characters or a few plot twists, Unlawful Entry plays everything by the book. And were it not for the notoriety of its stars (Kurt Russel, Ray Liota, and Madeline Stowe), this movie would sink to mediocrity faster than a Danielle Steele miniseries.<br /><br />Russel plays Michael Carr, an incessantly naive guy who calls on the help of a pair of officers when someone breaks into his house and tries to attack his wife (Madeline Stowe). Unfortunately, he quietly vents his anger about feeling so helpless in the situation to the wrong cop (Ray Liotta), a typically psychopathic villain with no limits for his power. At first empathizing with Carr (probably only pretending to do so), the cop befriends the couple. But soon enough, the cops wants Carr out of the way so, destroying the guys life nearly any way he can (which is pretty easy when you're a cop, and when you're the cop who has installed the guy's security system in his house) in order to take over and presumably, get his wife. It seems less ends-oriented, and more like the cop just wants to prove his power. The wife is more like a trophy, in other words, than an end. And the story plays out entirely by the book, you can probably predict every occurrence before it happens on the screen if you've seen enough of these movies. From the ""shocking"" moment our main, naive character realizes he is a victim of credit card fraud (perpetrated by the psychopathic villain) to the turn-around-he's-not-really-dead finale.",negative

As characters go the main one is a plain Example of Mary Sue syndrome - literally she has nothing to strive for there are no real obstacles to overcome - and the struggle to overcome characters own deficiencies or faults is the main driving force in hero movies - so ya this alone kills it pretty badly.

"What Irving Thalberg did in making this film today would never be attempted again. Making a Chinese story with occidental players even if they are of the caliber of Paul Muni, Luise Rainer, Charley Grapewin, and Walter Connolly among others.<br /><br />Perhaps it's partly because the story was written by a westerner, Pearl Buck who got a Pulitzer Prize for her novel in 1932. Ms. Buck, daughter of Chinese missionaries, probably brought China closer to the consciousness of America than any other person. Not the political struggles of China, but the lives and toil of the every day people we find in The Good Earth. Unfortunately later on, Pearl Buck became an apologist for the Kuomintang China of Chiang Kai-Shek in all its virtues and excesses. The rest of her literary output never matched The Good Earth.<br /><br />In The Sundowners there is a great description of comparing China to Australia by Peter Ustinov. When asked the difference, Ustinov said China was very big and very full and Australia was very big and very empty. That's what you see in The Good Earth, China very big and very full of people, more than she can deal with at times.<br /><br />The Good Earth tells the story of Wang Lung (Paul Muni) as a young man who purchases a wife from a large house where she was a slave. The woman O-Lan (Luise Rainer) bears him two sons and sees him through all the good times and bad they have, drought, famine, revolution, and a climatic locust plague.<br /><br />Luise Rainer won the second of two consecutive Oscars for portraying O-Lan. She may have set some kind of record in that it has to be the leading player Oscar performance with the least amount of dialog. Everything she does practically is done with facial expressions, her performance could have been on a silent film with very minimal subtitles. I think only John Mills in Ryan's Daughter had fewer words and he was playing a mentally retarded man.<br /><br />Muni is not always appreciative of how supportive she is in that male dominated culture. Rainer helps in the field, bears and raises the kids, does the housework. When Muni becomes a man of property he takes a Chinese second trophy wife who causes him a lot of grief. Still Rainer stoically bears it all. Still Muni is not a bad man and it's a tribute to the film and his acting and Buck's writing that you don't hate him and the culture gap is bridged. <br /><br />We've got a group of oriental players now who do more than just Kung Fu movies. I'm surprised The Good Earth of all films has not been remade at this point. I'll bet the Chinese government would even let some American company do it on an actual location.<br /><br />Till then we've got this great classic to appreciate and enjoy.",positive
"""Dead Man Walking"" is a film not about the death penalty, but about the people involved in a death penalty case -- the killer, the families whose kids were killed, the nun who becomes his spiritual advisor, and what happens. It tells the story with little fanfare but a lot of compassion and sensitivity. I have it on DVD, and every time I watch it (not often, it's never an easy film to watch) I'm more impressed by what Tim Robbins and the entire cast did here. So revealing that it could be a documentary, so compelling you can't take your eyes away, so subtle and yet so powerful... ""Dead Man Walking"" is nothing short of a masterpiece. It doesn't matter whether you're for or against the death penalty (or even have no opinion), this movie will have you thinking about the issues for sure. It takes a courageous screenwriter and director to look this material in the face without flinching even once, and everyone involved in the film pulls it off -- there isn't a single scene that rings false. A masterful film, but don't expect light viewing... to some, the final scenes could be more graphic than anything imaginable, even though no blood or violence is shown. You get drawn into this film and become a participant, and there's a character for just about everyone to identify with. 10/10.",positive

I particularly enjoyed the dialog and interaction between Keith and Lisa. If one looked beyond the superficial ""action"" that was taking place, Keith's character treated Lisa's ""deflowering"" with tenderness and consideration. The comic development that followed was also pulled in expertly in my opinion. David Boreanaz gives a wonderful performance as the adult male who clearly gets himself into more trouble than he can handle. Dialogue was sharp, quick and flowed nicely. The director and writer of this film clearly showed how none of the main characters got to claim the moral high ground after all the shenanigans they pulled. Although the movie appears light on the surface, it reflects all the gray areas of becoming an adult, human emotions and desire.",positive
Good movie!!  don't know what the haters are seeing,controversial
"As always, controversial movies like this have mixed reviews. You either love it or you hate it, and not everyone will like this movie. This shows the perspective of the killers, which is something I personally feel is something important to consider. You may hate them, you may claim to understand them and feel as though you can relate, but regardless this movie will make you think about school shootings from a different perspective.<br /><br />The movie is shot entirely using a hand-held camera, something that I think works quite well as it makes it more realistic. It is told completely from the killers point of view, from their ""missions"" to family outings, all leading up the big day ""Zero Day"" in which they are planning on a massacre at their school. Zero Day does not offer answers, but merely presents a glimpse at the lives of two troubled young boys and lets the audience decide for themselves. Our feelings towards the boys are something mixed between sympathy and hatred, but yet we are left confused as to why two ordinary young boys would do such a thing. They are shown to be surprisingly normal, typical teenage boys leading ordinary lives, and if we didn't know what they were planning we wouldn't expect a thing (They make it clear throughout the whole movie that no-one else knows about their plan)<br /><br />The acting is extremely good considering the two actors are complete unknowns. We can only hope to see more work from the both of them in the future. Despite how this is a fictionalized movie, one cannot help but notice the obvious similarities to Columbine. Calvin and Andre are scarily similar to Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, (not so much in looks, but in manner) As someone who has researched Columbine very extensively, I could see the similarities and it is almost certainly based on it. <br /><br />The actual massacre is shown through surveillance cameras at the school and is one of the most chilling things I have ever seen. I was completely in shock after seeing it, and its a feeling that stays around for a while. It is very realistic and well-done, and it is very difficult to watch.<br /><br />All in all Zero Day is an excellent movie, and I think everyone should at least check it out. In the past, we have always simply branded killers ""psychopaths"" and assumed that either they were biologically wired for disaster or had media influence, but as Zero Day shows sometimes the motives are deeper than that, and we can never truly understand why tragedies such as school shootings happen until we have seen it from the perspective of the killers.",positive

"My best guess is this piece of work will come out on DVD sometime before Christmas.<br /><br />This movie was terrible. The time line jumps all over the place. This wouldn't be so bad if it left some suspense for the end. It was entirely predictable.

Outcast girl brought evil spirits with her, makes neighbors go crazy and kill each other. Creepy kid understands what's going on.

It made me jump, I didn't expect most of what happened, and though I questioned some of the movie, it was still a fun watch. I didn't watch any previews for this the sequel, because I wanted to be surprised. I was, but in the wrong direction.",negative

"I saw this back in 99 and I remember loving it. Still to this day I can remember parts of the movie in my head, like the slanted pitch. Unfortunately from 99 - now I could never remember the name of this until I was looking through the filmography of a friend of my uncles and came across this (he played Clive Kennard). Straight away after reading the description I knew what it was. After catching up I was shocked to find out that not only did it not make a release on video or DVD but still has yet to be repeated. This is a massive shame, I am begging you ITV at least repeat this superb TV Movie. Nick Hancock showed in this movie he could do more than just host a show with his character Mike Tonker. This is a movie that most football fans would love and even those who aren't too keen on the sport would be able to enjoy the comedic value of this. Yes this is a brief review but there is not much to say apart from this is an underrated movie, deserves to be repeated or released on video/DVD so ITV, myself and other fans of this movie beg you. PLEASE CONSIDER ONE OF THOSE!",positive

"When I saw the movie in the cinema I enjoyed it I didn't think too much about everything so I enjoyed it. It was a shame to see so many men (and even some women) bash this movie just for having a female lead but oh well I guess. The dialogue felt cheesy at some points but overall was good. My only complaint is the storyline, which is kind of a big one, she didn't have any flaws and anything which could be perceived as one isn't. At no point does she have to overcome her flaws or use it to her advantage. I wish the scene between CM and whatever character jude law plays was instead done with neither of them having their powers, it would hark back to the training scene between them and show that CM didn't need to rely on her powers which she does in this movie. Also the soundtrack at some points was a bit eh. But overall I enjoyed it and while most people critiques are genuine ones rather than just being sexist it's a real shame to see so many people judge the movie on either brie larson or it being the first mcu movie with a female lead. As for the future of the character I hope they take her in the way some comics have as in her not being a 100% good guy and very much swaying between what's right and isn't, that could be cool.",positive

As with all good films, the viewer goes on a journey of their own to find their individual interpretation of the movie. The mystical aspect of the film is intriguing and adds to the suspense. You find your self looking for the answers along with Marquette. Audiences have liked the movie on the festival circuit - with many awards received, they must have agreed that A.W.O.L.

ok to good movie. how nick fury loses his eye is stupid but whatever. brie Larson was good in this role. regardless what stupid trolls are saying. to me it was a solid story. but not enough action or good action. and it makes MCU kinda having you saying huh? at the end. and special effects in some areas could of been better. oh and why Ronan the accuser was in this is anybody's guess. so I reccomend though especially because she is a badass and what the Russo brothers do with her. because you know they always make characters more badass,controversial

This movie was not the gem that was promised. An underwhelming lead gives us a hero that is unlikeable and at time down right boring to watch. While the supporting cast is just barely passable. The visuals were not amazing but good enough. SLJ is the only high point of the film and this may be his most forgettable role.  Will go down as the least interesting MCU movie........btw the cat was just ok,negative
"This film is too skeletal. It's a fairly low-budget film (I hope!) which excuses it somewhat, but the lack of a decent cast and a fleshed out plot hurts it too much. Phillips is quite believable in his role as a torn-apart son of a well-off family who's searching for himself (though his family is...er...well, a little too white...), but the rest of the cast is grasping at straws. Every moment that has potential is ruined by excessive melodrama, and there are *way* too many sub-plots (which is an obvious sign of plot-deficiency. They needed filler...) I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who isn't either a hard-core Phillips fan, or who has absolutely *nothing* to do. 4/10.",negative

"Captain Marvel is a good origin for a character that not too many comic book Ă˘conisuersĂ˘? know much about. Taking the bland and generic formula that was created in order to compete with the likes of Wonder Women, Marvel took what they could and ran with it. Brie Larson wasn't bad in this movie, she just wasn't great either; however her supporting roles took the heart of this movie by storm. Samuel L. Jackson was charismatic as always and the antagonists had a relatibility that isn't very commonplace for the MCU. With satisfactory set pieces and a nostalgic soundtrack to boot.

Let alone back in 1957, when memories were still very fresh and painful.<br /><br />This very black setting strongly contrasts with the fine and coherent style of 'Letjat zhuravli's' beautiful shots. Its simple story deals with human behaviour in times of war: bravery, love, patriotism, weakness, cowardice and corruption.

Dylan thomas is not the hero as sadly he was not throughout his life and neither really are the so called 'feisty woman' of the pr spiel. it is cillian the william of the movie. a man that leaves the woman he loves to fight a war that they ignore. his challenge to reoonnect with that indifference is what is of real interest to this film and what a beautiful performance from that actor. i thiink this film is underrated because it was marketed so badly.

"As a movie it was over all good, Plot was good, the characters well thought out and well written, the side characters were all outstanding and the actors such as Jude Law, and Samuel L Jackson and Lashana Lynch all turn in really good performances. Really Selling the plot and moving the story. The one quintessential failure of this movie is Brie Larson herself, who never once in the entire movie, seems to actually get the material or even really care that she is in a major motion picture. At best she seems to be simply phoning it in. The fact that Ms Larson fails to truly emote in the entire movie is only further highlighted by the outstanding work of the other cast members. Which only highlights the issue to the extreme causing Ms Larson to completely fall flat. Even in some of the more important flash back moments the massively underwhelming performance by Larson only dulls the point the writers were trying to make. Ms Larson in this role demonstrated that she was completely out of her element for this type of movie and would be quite at home playing a vulcan on star trek. Even her attempts at humor in this movie fell as flat as attempts by the Character Data in star trek to be funny. The only difference is that the effect created the character of data was an intentional one by the masterful work of Brent Spiner. The sheer lack luster performance here by Larson is just sad and drags down the whole movie. Even the post credits scene shows Larson's captain marvel as so wooden that she appears almost robotic next to Scarlett Johanson's Black Widow. The only way to save this character is to recast.",negative

But Larson's character doesn't really have an arch.  She's the typical Mary Sue of feminist films.

"Ugh. This movie has so many unbelievable plot contrivances that they made what could have been a good movie into a hideous mess. The story is halfway decent, but the holes in the plot make the execution literally laughable. We're actually supposed to believe that the Secret Service would go against all common sense and allow the President of the United States to be put at unbelievable risk. If this is an indication of the kind of thinking that passes for good judgment among the President's protectors, then we're all in trouble. Roy Scheider turns in a good performance as the President, but it is unfortunately offset by the truly loathsome acting of Patrick Muldoon (who somehow continues to get jobs in Hollywood based solely upon his good looks and his uncanny knack of smirking at every opportunity, regardless of whether the script calls for a smirk).

"I've seen a slew of ""80s rocker horrors"" over the years, from rubbish like ""Terror on Tour"" to ridiculously fun gems like ""Slumber Party Massacre 2."" Somehow I managed to keep putting this one off, which is strange because it's probably the most popular and well received one. Well, I finally caught up with it and it's easily the best of this mostly awful (but almost always endearing!) subgenre. The plot (which was pretty much lifted in the film ""Black Roses"") concerns a mulleted misfit named Eddie, whose ridiculed by all in his high school for his taste in music. He loves 80s metal, especially his idol Sammi Curr (played by the late great Tony Fields.) After Sammi is killed, Eddie favorite radio DJ gives him Sammi's final recording. Once Eddie plays the record backwards, he discovers he's a bit tougher, and bad things start happening to those who taunt him. Is Sammi's music possessed? ""Trick or Treat"" is well-made and a total hoot. The special effects are awesome, even though it does feature the typical 80s laser beams. I grew up in the 80s, and while I wasn't a fan of heavy metal, I do remember the urban legend about playing a record backwards hearing the sounds of Satan worshipping. Haha! I also remember being told by my older siblings and neighbors that both KISS and Ozzy worshipped Satan, so it's very amusing to see them both make cameos as a harmless radio DJ and a anti-rock priest. If only I had seen this film as a kid! While the film seems to poke fun at the popular connection in the 80s between alleged devil worship and heavy metal, the viewer never really finds out why Sammi Curr is back from the dead creating havoc and killing whoever gets in his way.

There are a few jokes that fall flat for sure, and in the sequels I'd lean more into her as a straight-man leader (like captain america) where he's not so much making the jokes as he IS the joke as a fish out of water overly earnest character. nnThe CGI in this film is top notch. There were no ""green screen moments"" like a lot of Marvel Phase 2+3 suffered from. The 3rd act fight scene didn't suffer from rubber man syndrome like Black Panther's big showdown.

"There are so many reasons as to why I rate the sopranos so highly, one of its biggest triumphs being the cast and character building. Each character unfolds more and more each series. Also each series has an array of different 'small time characters' as well as the main. A good example of a character (who was only in three episodes) who you can feel for is David the compulsive gambler played brilliantly by Robert Patrick. Every little detail builds the perfect TV series. The show revolves round mob boss Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) who attempts to balance his life of crime with his role as father of two. The show is not afraid to be bold and powerful with its dialogue and imagery and this is what makes it so believable. Whilst Tony runs things with capos Paulie (Tony Sirico) and Silvio (Steve Van Zant) his nephew Christopher (Michael imperioli) looks for a promotion. Every episode also features Tony's other family in some way which includes his children and wife carmela soprano (Edie Falco). On top of these problems is his uncle Junior soprano (Dominic Chianese) is trying to get what he can out of Tony's businesses despite being under house arrest. All the acting is powerful and characters complex, but the two who stand out the most are; James Gandolfini who 'is' Tony Soprano. Also Michael Imperioli who plays Christopher, representing the younger (20-30) generation in crime. If David Chase had not created this masterpiece modern TV dramas of such caliber may not have existed, such as The Wire and Dexter. So the Sopranos is definitely the Godfather, Goodfellas and Pulp fiction of TV",positive

"I wasn't even born when this series was released in the USA. It took about another decade before British TV networks laid hold of it.<br /><br />In fact, I was fortunate enough to see the very first episode, in which The Lone Ranger was one of a posse who ran into an ambush and got slaughtered. TLR was the only survivor. Although badly wounded, he was saved by a passing Indian called Tonto. I believe he took to wearing a mask in order to hide his true identity for fear of reprisal. But instead he made himself all the more recognisable. Dunno if he wore it in his sleep.<br /><br />This was Saturday teatime staple. The fanfare bugles of William Tell's overture presaged a dash to the telly, food still in hand. Though it very quickly became repetitive, predictable hokum. Nobody ever unmasked him. Nobody ever landed a punch, nobody ever out-shot him. He was a little too good, and just a little too camp in his dress for most kids. Poor Tonto, on the other hand, became his Aunt Sally. He was always getting slugged and tied-up and kidnapped and stuff.<br /><br />And what did he keep calling The Lone Ranger? 'King Savvy' was the general consensus where I lived. It seemed to imply 'the big know-all' in Indian-speak. But is sounded like something else, as if Mr Silverheels had a speech defect. 'Kemosabe'; what the hell's that? <br /><br />A later, and less well-merchandised duo called 'The Range Rider' and 'Dick West' eventually won my vote. This featured a naked-faced Jock Mahoney who got beat-up pretty thoroughly in each episode and was altogether less camp, less super, and more believable.<br /><br />Still; even today I can't hear William Tell's overture without expecting the gallop of hooves and a hearty Hi-Oh Silver.<br /><br />Devine daftness.",positive

"This is a classic continuation to Bleu, the likewise excellent film, with Juliet Binouche as a main star, moreover, she is a cameo appearance here, in Rouge, just for a second at the very end. But this film, truly red and very sweet although very sad, is a real winner. The main heroine, played by ever great Irene Jakob, is a successful photo / fashion model. She leads a full, active life, only darkened by her traumatic relations with her weird friend Mike, who is in England. By some lucky chance, she gets friendly with the old Judge, who spends time listening to the private telephone talks of his neighbors. The story starts to weave even further, and we see him in court, being almost universally condemned for his pastime. She is the only one who feels sympathy for him, for his cute doggy Rita and her pups, and for all the people who surround them. We also witness the break-up of a happy couple of a young lawyer and his lady, and their quarrel is also fueled by that telephone scandal... But the film is not about this, even. It is mostly about the loneliness and deep rifts between people, far and near. When she sails to England on a ferry, with that lawyer as a chance fellow-passenger, as well as that earlier mentioned Binoche who starred in Bleu, the ship sinks and we see the horrified look of The Judge when he watches the news trying to guess if she survived. She did, and still we feel very heavy at heart. Mr. Kislowski managed to draw a grand, subtle story about the solitude, misunderstanding, secrets and pain. Deep, dark personal pain of those who are lost and lonely. Brilliant film.",positive

"Captain marvel was mediocre at best...  Where do I start. The main actress was ok. Only ok. Her performance was flat. The villains sucked... They all tuck tail and run in the end. She ends up being way to over powered and there is really no steaks for her. The only adversity she faces is her amnesia. Her character doesn't developed or change throughout the movie. Sam Jackson was great as always. The supporting cast was pretty good. The action was pretty decent if a little disjointed and if no consequence to her. Some great actors and characters were wasted. Some major changes were made to the story compared to comic book cannon that I found distasteful and unneeded aka Mar-vel sex swap. The overplayed misogyny and oppressive patriarchy was cringeworthy. The cat and the tesseract, and then the eye scratch incident were poorly conceived. I also did not like how they made shield and Fury seen so insignificant and inadequate as a hero... This movie makes me worry if marvel is heading down a similar path as Star Wars which would be sad to see. I really hope Disney doesn't screw up the avengers franchise and the MCU with this characters introduction.",controversial

"This is, ostensibly, a movie about multiple grief. As such, it ought to move viewers and make them empathetic with the plight of the main characters. However, its irritatingly postmodern style makes it almost incomprehensible. The camera continually switches from one scene to another, from one personal crisis to the next, creating a choppy, disjointed effect. Most characters appear to live aimless, unstructured lives, held together by their professional commitments. (It also stretches credibility that a man who has just been given what amounts to a likely death sentence, would cheerfully indulge in a sex romp with a woman he has just met). The storyline (if there is a storyline) is difficult to follow. In sum, the overall effect is rather disappointing. In spite of all that, the acting is generally good and some of the scenes are quite powerful.",negative

"I saw ""Myra Breckinridge"" when it first came out in 1970. I was a healthy 20-year-old at the time, who loved movies and really liked Raquel Welsh. On top of that, I had read the Gore Vidal novel it was based on and thought it was very funny. I saw the movie at a local drive-in and about half way through I was sorely tempted to turn the motor of my car on so that maybe I'd die of monoxide poisoning and not have to see the rest of this shipwreck of a movie. It wasn't ""smart"" or ""trendy"", it was gross and sloppy. All the actors were tone deaf and the director didn't have the slightest idea what he was doing. The casting of Mae West was one of the worst casting choices in movie history. As one reviewer here said, her role had nothing to do with the movie or book. Her character in the book is sexually beaten up by the young stud, which would never do for the legendary Ms. West. Oh no, the plot is changed so she sexually beats HIM up, very believable from a 77-year-old woman who looks every DAY of her age. I could go on, but why?

It's clear they want to start something new and they only used the old characters to help start this new path. While it's fine to do this, it's not good to disrespect some characters that people have grown up 40+ years with.

Breaking the magic of Rudolph's nose, framing Rudolph, threatening to melt the Frosty family...The comedically exaggerated plots of Pinky and the Brain and ""Phineas and Ferb's"" Dr. Doofenshmirtz (which are done that way on purpose and played for laughs) seem simple and straightforward compared to Winterbolt's, which we're expected to take somewhat seriously.<br /><br />There is a particularly (and amusingly) strange moment when a character throws her two guns at the bad guy, like boomerangs.

The problems that their love affair suffers makes it, ironically, more believable and the simple features like the contrast between the colours of Matthew's and Nimi's clothes alone, makes this film all the more enchanting.

"Strengths: There has been a lot of talk about Brie Larson (Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel) leading her own superhero film. I'd say she does a great job here. She does lack some of the charisma that some other MCU stars have, but she carries the role with confidence and a snarky attitude that makes her come across as tough. The supporting characters are where this movie truly shines. Ben Mendelsohn (Talos) steals the show among the actors. Without giving too much away, he embodies every single aspect of the character he needs to at various times of the film. Goose the cat is the other show stealer. Samuel L. Jackson (Nick Fury) is likable and has an easy chemistry with Larson. The special effects on de-aging him and Clark Gregg (Phil Coulson) look the best they ever have. It came across as natural. I also loved both Lashana Lynch (Maria Rambeau) and Akira Akbar (Monica Rambeau). Lynch is especially fantastic and has one of the best scenes when she gives her big speech. The visuals are outstanding, especially towards the end. The movie is kind of the opposite of older MCU solo debuts. It picked up late with one of the better final two-thirds in the series. The 90s theme throughout the film is mostly well done, from the music to the references. Of course, the post-credits scenes are both fantastic.nnWeaknesses: While I did like Danvers, she suffers from a similar problem that T'Challa had in Black Panther. The supporting characters outshined her very often. The 90s stuff also got a bit overdone at points. Jude Law (Yon-Rogg) is lackluster here, giving nothing special to his role. The character was also kind of a drag and is featured in some of the film's weaker moments. Lee Pace (Ronan the Accuser) was brought back for no reason. The character is lame and does nothing of note in this movie. The first third of the movie is forgettable and filled with far too much obvious exposition. nnOverall: There are clear flaws in the movie, but the good heavily outweighs the bad. Larson is strong, while the supporting cast of characters is among the best we've seen in the MCU to this point. Great visuals and a fun final two-thirds makes for one hell of a ride that will leave you satisfied",negative

"Back in the 60's, this grim study of Joy, a young proletarian wife, was the introduction to the career of Ken Loach, who became one of the most distinguished and respected British filmmakers of all time. By then I knew very little about Brecht, politics or the reality of the under-privileged, and I was quite impressed by the aesthetic of the film, its free style, its austere color cinematography, and Joy's monologues in front of the camera. I was also much surprised to find that Terence Stamp (who had become a celebrity, thanks to ""Billy Budd"", ""The Collector"" and ""Modesty Blaise"") had so little screen time. Although 20th Century Fox distributed ""Poor Cow"" in Panama, Loach did not stay in mainstream cinema (which this film hardly is) and I lost contact with his films.

"Despite John Travolta's statements in interviews that this was his favorite role of his career, ""Be Cool"" proves to be a disappointing sequel to 1995's witty and clever ""Get Shorty.""<br /><br />Travolta delivers a pleasant enough performance in this mildly entertaining film, but ultimately the movie falls flat due to an underdeveloped plot, unlikeable characters, and a surprising lack of chemistry between leads Travolta and Uma Thurman. Although there are some laughs, this unfunny dialog example (which appeared frequently in the trailers) kind of says it all: Thurman: Do you dance? Travolta: Hey, I'm from Brooklyn.<br /><br />The film suggests that everyone in the entertainment business is a gangster or aspires to be one, likening it to organized crime. In ""Get Shorty,"" the premise of a gangster ""going legitimate"" by getting into movies was a clever fish-out-of water idea, but in ""Be Cool,"" it seems the biz has entirely gone crooked since then.<br /><br />The film is interestingly casted and the absolute highlight is a ""monolgue"" delivered by The Rock, whose character is an aspiring actor as well as a goon, where he reenacts a scene between Gabrielle Union and Kirsten Dunst from ""Bring It On."" Vince Vaughan's character thinks he's black and he's often seen dressed as a pimp-- this was quite funny in the first scene that introduces him and gets tired and embarrassing almost immediately afterward.<br /><br />Overall, ""Be Cool"" may be worth a rental for John Travolta die-hards (of which I am one), but you may want to keep your finger close to the fast forward button to get through it without feeling that you wasted too much time. Fans of ""Get Shorty"" may actually wish to avoid this, as the sequel is devoid of most things that made that one a winner. I rate this movie an admittedly harsh 4/10.",negative

She was actually terrible, and stands out as one of the worst performances (or casting choices) in recent memory. Whether it was the atrocious dialogue, hamfisted direction, her acting itself, or a combination of the three... she just remained an unendearing character throughout with zero charisma, and never once seemed like the tough hero she was meant to be. Suspension of disbelief was virtually non existent. nI was surprised that the film didn't focus too heavily on gender politics, certainly not as much as expected at least. There are of course a few clichĂ (C)d and tacky lines (""let's show these boys how we do it"" ""call me young lady again and I'll kick your ass"" come to mind), but neither of these were from Captain Marvel herself and overall I didn't feel like I was being beaten over the head with gender politics. nThe time period wasn't really a hook for me, with it mostly just coming across as ""hey let's laugh at the 90's"". The loading gag didn't even get me to crack a smile. And while the were some nostalgic feels seeing Blockbuster, I weirdly couldn't get past how or why The Hudsucker Proxy, First Knight and Last Action Hero would be on the same shelf together. (and then drove past one of the last remaining Blockbusters that's now closing down on the way home).nMusic wise, I liked a few token songs but thought it was nowhere near as well selected as Awesome Mix vol.1, and the score was just generic indistinct wallpaper. nWhile I did like the loose tie-ins to GotG, about the nicest thing I can say about the film is that the de-aging effects are amazing, eclipsing those seen in former MCU movies (themselves already impressive). I will also say that I was glad it didn't follow the origin movie formula that's become way too common lately.

Why do people keep comparing this movie to Wonder Woman? That movie was trash and people follow the herd mentality and say it's great to avoid looking sexist. Both movies try way too hard to make female characters look badass and lose sight of the plot and genuine character development. ,negative
"My daughter, her friends and I have watched this movie literally dozens of times. I bought it twice and some little girlfriends absconded with it. Subsequently, I rented it so very many times. It just never gets old!!! Blockbuster doesn't even have it in their listings anymore and I have tried to buy, find, rent it for over 5 years. Without a doubt, this was and is my most favourite movie of my daughter's childhood...it has it all! We laughed, we cried, we discussed real life and how hard some children have it in the world. There was nothing pretend about this movie. We related to every second and every line Bill! Thanks a million for restoring our faith in human nature. Sincerely, Shelleen and Kailin Vandermey.

"i love this movie. it focuses on both issues: reality and fantasy. reality because hey, we all wanted a date from that popular guy Billy. and some of us haven't been kissed yet, right? be honest!<br /><br />another real issue is because of the pain people gain from teasing. and whoa, high school life. remember it? the fantasy is finding your true love, when you're 25 and still in high school. not really fantasy, but close enough!<br /><br />although some parts are unbelievable, it was a great movie. there are no other words to describe such incredible work. and the story was wonderful. Drew Barrymore did a charmingly wonderful job, same as the hilarious David Arquette. the people who worked in the movie are all wonderful. didn't i just repeat that?<br /><br />Never Been Kissed is one of the movies that the later generations should watch. it shows reality and some-not issues for people like you and me.",positive

Highlights were Brie Larson, Samuel L Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, kitty cat and Jude Law. It's probably of my favourite standalone MCU films, and I found it more enjoyable than Ant-Man and the Wasp, and I'll go as far as to say I enjoyed it more than Black Panther.

Gorgeously photographed and well acted with dialog that approaches poetry the film involves lust, hate, murder, rape, theft and deception. It weaves an intense web that left me unable to take my eyes off the screen until the closing credits. The story is sweeping. It takes the audience from the atrocities of the Spanish Civil War to the human wreckage left behind. Roger Casamajor and Bruno Bertanzoni are two young actors who command the screen. Supporting players are excellently cast and lend a real sense of authenticity. Sets, lighting, scenery and cinematography are wonderful. I absolutely love the photography.",positive
"For those expecting the next comic book movie to become the next cultural representation or the next feminist movement avant garde, don't bother yourself to watch this movie.

I think the opening scene is a bit slow and the trailers that was shown is a bit misleading. However, overall this movie is OK for an origin story. (SPOILER ALERT) - the retconned story also did not much alter the MCU timeline and also possibly eliminate or at least diminish the fans theory regarding certain shape-shifting species plays a part in the previous installment of MCU movies from Iron Man to now, because the narrative of the story is that they are basically an intergalactic refugee just trying to find a place far and peaceful enough to hide from their genocidal enemy.

"Screened this morning for the press at Roma film festival, ""N - io e Napoleone"" is easy to love. First of all it can count on great production values, as very few Italian films nowadays can, with wonderful settings and costumes. The cast is great too. Director Virzì constantly speaks of the young lead Elio Germano as ""a young De Niro"". Now, of course he is going a way too far, but sure the boy can act. I loved his performance, and he did a great job with the (tuscan) accent. Daniel Auteuil is a great actor and did very well as Bonaparte. It's really great to see him acting in Italian, I hope to see him working in Italy again very soon. The supporting cast worked well too - people like Valerio Mastrandrea or Sabrina Impacciatore may seem unlikely choices, but they all gave fine performances. Even Massimo Ceccherini, best known for appearing in his own moronic films and in trashy TV reality shows, fitted in well and was actually funny. The low point of the cast was the ""Diva"" Monica Bellucci. Sure, she was slightly better than usual, but she managed to look (and sound) utterly unnatural even in the part of baronessa Emilia, in which, with a good dose of self irony, she used her own umbro accent. The script, by veteran Furio Scarpelli and Virzì himself is clever, with lots of laugh out loud lines, and a few very emotional moments too. Sure, the ending left me puzzled. The message is kind of ambiguous: the whole film says that political ideals can bring you to blind hate, but if you get closer you will learn that the object of your hate is after all a little human being like everyone else, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, sometimes pathetic, so that suddenly it's difficult to hate him; then, in the last few minutes it says that after all it would have been better to shoot him in the head at the beginning. Personally, I dislike very much this notion. ""Io e Napoleone"" is still a pleasant film, the best presented at the Festival so far (the other being Fur and the Hoax). My rating is 8/10",positive

"""In April 1946, the University of Chicago agreed to operate Argonne National Laboratory, with an association of Midwestern universities offering to sponsor the research. Argonne thereby became the first ""national"" laboratory. It did not, however, remain at its original location in the Argonne forest. In 1947, it moved farther west from the ""Windy City"" to a new site on Illinois farmland. When Alvin Weinberg visited Argonne's director, Walter Zinn, in 1947, he asked him what kind of reactor was to be built at the new site. When Zinn described a heavy-water reactor operating at one-tenth the power of the Materials Testing Reactor under design at Oak Ridge, Weinberg joked it would be simpler if Zinn took the Oak Ridge design and operated the Materials Testing Reactor at one-tenth capacity. The joke proved unintentionally prophetic.""<br /><br />The S-50 plant used convection to separate the isotopes in thousands of tall columns.

"""Edge of the City"" is another movie that owes a lot of credit to ""On the Waterfront"". From it's NYC locations, to its score, to the belief that whatever trouble you may be in, you can somehow right your wrongs.<br /><br />""Edge"" also deals with ideas like loyalty and racism. In my opinion, that is where the movie does not succeed like ""Waterfront"". At 85 minutes the movie rushes through the establishment of relationships, and ties everything up so quickly that much of it seems forced and unbelievable.<br /><br />Possible Spoilers****<br /><br />The relationship between Sidney Poitier and John Cassavettes could have been further developed in the beginning. I don't believe that these two characters, from two very different places would have built such a strong relationship so quickly. <br /><br />I think that the whole love sub-plot with Cassavettes could have been eliminated. He is so awkward with a woman that it becomes painful to watch. The only reason why it is in the movie is so that she can motivate him to do the right thing at the end. There are other ways that they could have shown this. I would have also liked to see some scenes of Axel in the army to illustrate why he is the way he is.<br /><br />The acting is excellent. Poitier is terrific in a role that is beautifully written. His role as Tyler is interesting and multi-layered, and (especially for 1957), a man who is confident, respected, and intelligent. Cassavettes, as Axel North, while very good, does not seem quite right for the part. Warden is terrific as the boss who knows Axel's secret (although his fight scene with Cassavettes at the end is staged horribly. Too many break-away boxes). I thought Ruby Dee was wonderful in role of Poitier's wife.<br /><br />On the whole, ""Edge of the City"" is a smart, movie with a very good cast that tries too hard to be an interesting noir style picture, without taking the time to let the drama build.<br /><br />7 out of 10",positive

"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I feel greatly touched by the theme the movie intends to convey. One sentence that keeps coming up on my mind is that ""history repeats itself"". Life is what it is shown in the movie: when people are young, they seem not to understand their parents, their own spouses; people have every excuse for not sharing the dearest time with their children until too late; people always have to work hard to support the whole family but are just liable to neglect the subtle feeling of their partners; people always change their perspectives at different stages of their lives; people can always be forgiven if their heart is full of love for their beloved; nothing is more important than the blood relation people share in this world, and one is never too late to talk with their folks about what they feel at the bottom of their heart so as to achieve a better understanding between themselves, so that when life has to end some day, people should not feel sorry or regretful since they have kept their words and there is always hope ---a new life. The actors and actresses are fantastic. They have understood the director's intention perfectly. The movie's charm lies in, to me, the effect of bringing a skillful and splendid fusion of cheers and tears to the audience.",positive

"On the surface the idea of Omen 4 was good. It's nice to see that the devil child could be a girl. In fact, sometimes, as in the Exorcist, when girls are possessed or are devilry it's very effective.

Issues that maybe only a therapist, rather then a priest could help. She does not look scary or devilish. Rather, she looks sulky and moody.<br /><br />This film had potential and if it was made by the same people who had made the previous three films it could of worked. But it's rather insulting really to make a sequel to one of the most favoured horror trilogies, as a made for TV movie special.<br /><br />On so many levels it lets down. It's cheap looking, the acting is hammish and the effects are typical of a TV drama. The characters do not bring any sympathy, and you do not route for them. I recently re-watched it after someone brought it for me for Christmas, and it has dated appalling.<br /><br />If your thinking of watching this, then I would suggest that you don't.

I thought that the funniest scenes were where Blandings hires a contractor to dig a well for water. They dig down hundreds of feet, but never find water. Yet only a short distance away, a few days later, the basement of his house-to-be floods!<br /><br />Cary Grant and Myrna Loy give believable performances as the harried Blandings couple overwhelmed by problems they never imagined, and Melvyn Douglas is even better as Blanding's lawyer and family friend.<br /><br />The only caveat is that social attitudes have changed a lot since 1948. Mrs. Blandings is portrayed as a bit of a naive dimbulb who has no idea how much additional trouble she's causing, and there's a black maid (horrors!).

"Although Captain Marvel was a spectacle in flashy CGI and special effects it lacked spirit and charisma from its main and fundamental character Carol Danvers. As the movie progressed I was interested whether audience members were laughing whenever Captain Marvel was making a joke. To my surprise a scarce few laughed at her jokes... Brie Larson was a tad wooden and stoic in her performance. I know she is a competent actress and I thought she was excellent in The Room (if I got the name of the movie right). It seems she was either A) mis-casted or B) the director did not provide a lot of information for the character. Furthermore, there is no real clear understanding why the Kree are stubborn at going to war with another species. What is the benefit, especially after the big reveal? Also there didn't seem to be any challenges that faced Captain Marvel in the big showdown... ultimately she was invincible, which made the climax dull. The character of Captain Marvel felt more like a caricature than a full fleshed out character. They definitely needed to expand on her life experience as a child, adolescent , and possibly young adult. On a good note  Samuel Jackson and Jude Law, among others were great and provided the right ingredients to make things interesting.",negative
"I'm a fan of the horror movie, regardless of which hemisphere it comes from. I know what to expect from the West, the East and most horrors in the middle. So I received the DVD of 'Acacia' in the post and looked forward to a slow build of ever increasing tension and scary children with odd, disjointed movements hiding under duvets.<br /><br />The major selling point for this film was that it has a far more linear story line than many of this ilk - you get who the characters are, where they are from and what they do. You get the baseline information (nice couple, can't have children) and realise that the premise is just too normal for something freaky NOT to happen.<br /><br />And then comes the bad. The number one complaint is that the story is OBVIOUS. I got it pretty much the moment the kid hugged the tree. I knew where the film was going and was even able to predict the order of death and for what reason.<br /><br />The editing is shocking and unfortunately, not to the benefit of the film. Even were I still pondering the events, tension isn't allowed to build because the director seems to have gotten a new editing suite for his birthday and wanted to use it as much as possible.<br /><br />And my final gripe is this....the tree was unnecessary. This would have been a perfectly good tale of subtle horror with just the couple breaking down over the death of the child - the titular tree bought nothing new or exciting to the film. So I'll finish where I started - my overall impression was 'Oh.'",negative
"While politics from both sides made me consider not watching it, I ended up watching it. nnDespite it being Marvel's first female led superhero film, it fails to make itself standout from the MCU. This film is aggressively average, whose main character is as bland as a cardboard box. It's a shame, really, as Brie Larson is a talented actress. But she, the directors, and writers didn't know how they want to portray Captain Marvel. Do they want to make her a scrappy fighter, who is so eager on getting into fights? Or do they want her to be a stoic leader, who takes each situation at hand seriously? I don't know what her personality is and this is a shame, as previous MCU films do a decent job on creating likable main characters. This is also problematic, as she will be the face of the MCU in the future. If she remains like this in future films, you can count me out. All I want is some form of believable personality.nnNot only is the main character awful, but the themes that the film tells, are all lip service. The film doesn't explore much of the themes and they only time when they do mention it, is in forms of flashbacks or they are DIRECTLY talking about them. It's a shame, because the themes are very good and does have a positive message. But the film doesn't do much and plays it EXTREMELY safe. It's all surface level and anyone who tries to get more out of it, would look like fools.nnThere are more complaints I have, but I like to keep this one short and sweet. At the film's best, it's average. But I find this film to be aggressively average, to the point that it's insulting. The character is bland, the film looks bland, the themes are laughably nonexistent, and just downright boring.

This is my first review on the rotten tomatoes website and I had to do it because I was extraordinarily dissatisfied with this movie stemming all way from the ad campaign to the movie itself. First I'd like to say the chemistry in the movie with Its characters are ok at best Brie Larson seemed very unprepared for this role and not a likable character for the role. I think Brie is a solid actress but she really didn't capture my interest in this movie she more so felt as a figure head for a movie in attempt to push an agenda. And please if someone else watched this movie and felt like you watched the entirety of it in trailers let me know because that's how I felt. I also think part of the problem lies in the faults of whoever thought it was a good idea to make a captain marvel movie she has been a heavily tampered character with over marvels publishing and this version is relatively new I much rather have seen a movie with the likes of maybe Jennifer Walters having to be a working women dealing with the fact she can turn into a rage monster too. Or even given black widow her solo movie and giving her more attention earlier. The only thing I really like about this movie is the cgi which was even a little spotty at times but all in all very disappointed with the movie but I have Great hope for the black widow movie to bring home the real title as a strong female lead marvel movie.,controversial

"This movie would have been alright, indeed probably excellent, if the directors would have left the interviews and the concert footage separate. ""Into the Void"" is a great song, and I hate how it is cut off at the best part to go to an mumbling interview with Ozzy Osbourne. That should have been at the end of the film, or located in a special feature. The best part of concert DVDs is to put them on and let the music play, but ""Black Sabbath: The Last Supper"" is hard to put and and simply let play because the music is continually interrupted. Nevertheless, there are a few strengths to this film; the concert footage, when it does play, it excellent. Black Sabbath returns to the stage after a long hiatus without Osbourne and this film captures that well: Sabbath basically rocks the fans. The fans, of course, have a sweet advantage in the film because they are seeing the band live, of course, but also they do not have to put up with the incessant interviews that the DVD viewers are burdened with. Shame on Jeb Brien and Monica Hardiman (the directors) for doing this to the film! Also, shame on Wyatt Smith for editing the film in such a way.",negative

"Captain Marvel is the 21st film in the Marvel cinematic universe. Itâ€s the story of Carol Danvers an Air Force pilot who gets powers and becomes one of the strongest heroes in the Marvel universe. nnI have been pretty hyped since I heard that this was the next Marvel film and that Captain Marvel would usher in the new phase of the MCU. Also with the controversy surrounding the movie I was hoping that the movie would exceed expectations and silence angry misogynistic fanboys. I even got a copy of Carol Danvers first comic book appearance. nnThe movie was entertaining but gets confused in tone. It's struggles juggling being a pure action movie, a 90's nostalgia film and it's girl power narrative. All these themes were good but the directors don't balance them well. nnBrie Lawson's acting was wooden at times but I attributed it to the idea that she's playing a space warrior that doesn't realize she's human but overall she's fine. I don't think it's her fault because Brie is super talented. Shes won an Oscar for her acting ability. I think the directors hindered her performance.nnThe chemistry between her and Sam Jackson was great. I think this is their third movie together so they have collaborated in the past and bounce off each other well. The Samuel L. Jackson de-aging technology is amazing.

"I have been hooked on ""GG"" since midway through 2001-2002 (2nd season), when I tuned in to see ""Smallville"" 10 minutes early. Thanks to ""Beginnings"", I now have all but 2 episodes on tape, right up through last night (Ep. 4.9). I am a middle-aged straight male, and this is the ONLY weekly TV show I watch.<br /><br /> I love this series because: a) Lauren Graham is a damn fine-looking woman, and funny and smart to boot; b) the dialogue is extremely well-written; c) it is flat-out hilarious, putting overrated garbage like ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" to shame. Many current TV comedies have been heavily influenced by the highly successful and much-despised slime-pit known as ""Married with Children"", where the viewer is encouraged to deride and feel superior to the characters. In ""GG"", the characters have faults, but we can see our own foibles in them, and laugh with them, not at them. This is stimulating TV, where the writers challenge us to keep up with rapid-fire exchanges and out-of-left-field pop-culture/literature/current events references. I get immense pleasure out of watching these episodes over and over again, catching all the one-liners and references to previous episodes.

"Third time trying to write a review for this movie because when i check later, I see my profile has made 0 reviews. The movies was not terrible, but not particularly good. I don't see how it's got a 79% fresh rating. I'm not even certain the current 62% is particularly accurate. The pacing of the movie wasn't very good, there were definitely some nostalgic moments for me, as I grew up in the 90's. However, the soundtrack probably shouldn't make it hard to hear the sound effects or dialog. The chemistry between the characters of Captain marvel and Agent Fury was pretty great, although the way they made Agents Coulson and Fury look younger was a bit disconcerting, sort of Uncanny Valley. The continuity issues from other MCU movies didn't really make sense either. In Iron Man, Coulson introduces himself as part of the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division, to which Pepper Potts when he's trying to get a foot in the door to talk with Tony Stark. He later tries to talk to Tony directly and a similar exchange comes up. Both times, it's mentioned the name is ""a mouthful. By the end of the movie, he says ""Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D."" If this all happens in 2008, why is the Agent Coulson of 1995 already calling the organization by its acronym? Why does Danvers hear Nirvana's ""Come as you Are"" in her mind when she disappeared in 1989 and wasn't on Earth for the 1991 release of the Smells Like Teen Spirit album? How is she capable of utilizing her newly gained abilities flawlessly without the benefit of practice to see what her abilities do? The first time I tried riding a motorcycle, I could barely keep it upright and couldn't avoid stalling the motor. Our hero can gain the ability to fly and zip around with ease without losing control, and blast things that are moving at some pretty high speeds with remarkable accuracy, all without having tried to do those things earlier in the film. How is she also able to fly all the different craft she pilots, made from different planets (Kree warship, Skrull escape pod, US Air Force F-15. experimental jet...there are more continuity errors, but this is a pretty lengthy list already.nnAll these issues would be moot if this was a standalone movie, but to be given to the audience as an important origin story leading to the MCU's overall plot of the Infinity War, this poses problems that shouldn't have made it to the final film. I'll refrain from diving into the controversial and political things people have mentioned about this movie and say as an MCU movie, Captain Marvel fell a bit short. Again, not horrible, I was entertained, but I have way too many complaints to justify calling this a good movie. I hope the writing team puts more effort into continuity for future movies.",positive

"I went to see this film in spite of the agenda marketing which was, in my opinion, very counter productive. This film was probably the worst character intro film Marvel has released since establishing the MCU, but probably on par with Thor 2 or Iron Man 2/3. It's not terrible, it is still better than most of the DCEU films except Wonder Woman, a film that did just about everything right. My main issue is that the character's journey is a little weak. She is a badass superhero rediscovering who she used to be, which was a badass fighter pilot. There isn't a lot of character growth for Carol, we don't really see her as anything other than awesome, even in her previous life. It really wasn't quite as exciting or compelling as other Marvel character debuts. I think much of that falls to the character, she is overpowered, like Superman in some ways, but without much of the charm. Overall, an OK film that wasn't as bad as I expecting. There were some 'agenda' moments that felt a little forced, and at least one major Nick Fury character moment that was turned into a bit of a joke which seemed like a waste, but I didn't hate it.

"Okay, what the fuck is up with the misplaced 90s grunge-rock music? It's weird to be listening to â€Come As You Are' while some superhero gets ready to beat the shit out of some alien motherfuckers. Intentions were noble but I think Marvel did their first major female-centric film dirty. It's kind of an awful taste but good execution type of thing that happened here. I would love to see a female-fronted Marvel film that isn't as turgid as `Wonder Woman'â€”which is actually pretty good in itself. But unlike the above-named DC film, `Captain Marvel' was nowhere close to surpassing its male-centric predecessors. Even `Ant-Man' was more watchable. I say this because I hoped to be proven wrong, even after making at least four attempts to watch this film before eventually getting to finally finish it in one sitting. Furthermore, I hoped misogynistic knobs were merely exaggerating and being their usual salty, hateful selves in every comment section of a given post about this film or Alison Brie.

"Onstage John Osborne's adaptation of ""Picture of Dorian Gray"" is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde's talents as both novelist and playwright.On screen with some editing it becomes a bit sloppy due to the cutting of 3 crucial scenes from the play (one being an important scene between Basil and Henry showing that time has passed.)The acting however is brilliant. Sir john Gielgud return's to his Wilde roots as lord Henry,and although about a decade too old for the role,he totally becomes the enigmatic,life loving cad and cynic that Wilde brought to life so meticulously in his novella. Jeremy Brett is also strong,offering a touching portrait of the anguished artist Basil Hallward.Peter Firth,while not originally my vision of Dorian, handles the role with style and grace...and later with a convincing strain of cruelty. The supporting cast is equally fine, Gielgud's former 'Importance Of Being Earnest"" co-star Gwen Francon-Davies plays his philanthropic Aunt Agatha with dignity and Judi Bowker makes a touching Sybil Vane. The wit,pathos and tension of Wilde's work have been remarkably transferred to the screen. My only other qualm is with the hair styles. Many of them seemed out of place,looking more like 1970's versions of Victorian hairdos rather than the actual style. Overall however,the acting and writing elevates this production to a high level of small screen excellence.",positive

"Saw the movie on opening weekend, and given all the controversy about fake reviews I was compelled to actually make an account to leave this review. With that being said, here goes:nnI enjoyed the movie. I didn't think it was as good as some of the other recent Marvel movies such as Infinity War, but that is probably an unfair comparison anyway. I didn't find the villain to be particularly interesting at all, which was a common complaint of Marvel movies until very recently. I some of the CGI special effects were less than stellar, particularly Brie's mouth in the scenes where she is wearing her half helmet and some of the scenes with Goose.  Not as bad as Henry Cavil's computer removed mustache, but less than we have come to expect in top of the line movies these days.nnThe story was a bit slow paced, but in my opinion given that it is an origin story that is more forgivable that it was in the case of Age of Ultron for example.nnThe character of Carol Danvers herself left a little bit to be desired, which will probably be the most contentious opinion I have. Unfortunately I just didn't really get the feeling that she was all that compelling and a character that would immediately feel at home with it the larger MCU. Again I will cut the film a little slack because of the origin story arc, since those usually aren't as good, but movies like Doctor Strange and Black Panther show that that can be overcome.nnBeing a female driven movie was obviously a big part of the movie, and I admit it some of the obviously Ă˘girl powerĂ˘? type stuff felt a bit superfluous especially in the beginning I thought they tied it in pretty well with the metaphor of her being called weak because she was a woman providing the drive and strength to stand up in the middle of an intergalactic war when she is Ă˘justĂ˘? a human. Did I think it was absolutely necessary to the story? No, not really. Was it choking me with Ă˘SJWĂ˘? propaganda? No. Having seen the movie I think anyone who says the movie was Ă˘ruinedĂ˘? by Ă˘feminismĂ˘? probably has an agenda of their own.  There were certainly problems with the movie that you could complain about, but they had nothing to do with a Ă˘political messageĂ˘?nnAll in all in my totally subjective opinion in the Pantheon of Marvel there are 4 legitimately standout Ă˘goodĂ˘? movies (Avengers 1 and 3, Captain America 2, and Thor 3) and 3 legitimately standout Ă˘badĂ˘? movies (Thor 2 and Iron Man 2 and 3).

"I got this in the DVD 10 pack CURSE OF THE DEAD. You gotta love those bargain packs. For even if they don't feature true remastering, restoration and all that hoo-ha, and the films are generally in full-frame pan and scan format, there's no denying that there are always a few gems included. And by ""gems"", I mean there's always some good crap to be seen, especially if the films are from the '70s as The Mansion of Madness is.<br /><br />My copy is called Mansion of Madness, but when the title screens roll it's Poe's Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon. Doesn't matter, really, as crap is crap is crap, no? Yes! But saying this film is completely worthless is not true at all. There are some funky elements here and there, and obviously the flick did have a decent budget.<br /><br />The opening title sequence is cool with its colored negative run through a cheap TV look. The dialogue is always hilarious. Near the beginning of the film, the horse and buggy driver gets out to move a dead tree stump in the middle of the road. ""WHAT STRENGTH!"" says Our Hero. Funny, then, that this dude should later not be able to fight off the wacky woodsmen when they come to make freaky fun. You'll completely forget that this guy was even in the movie until he crops up again later near the end. That's how memorable these characters are.<br /><br />The best part about Mansion of Madness, however, has to be the wacky music and screwball hijinks that the good guys have to endure. It's like bad cartoon music that a three year old would find enjoyable. And why all the weirdo slapstick, anyway? I'd say my fave moment had to be when the horse and buggy is ambushed by the forest freaks when they pull a stupid looking homemade ghost up by a stick in the middle of the road and make the buggy stop. What the hell? Oh yeah, there's plenty of boobies to be seen, too, for those of you that dig such things. Boobies, bad dialogue, and wacky music. That best sums of Mansion of Madness for me. It's well worth at least one viewing, and may be a lot better if you've had a few to drink or whatnot. I can't say I was ever bored watching it, but I can't deny that it's also a barrel of poop.

"This was Laurel and Hardy's last silent film for Roach Studios. However, since the public had a real thirst for ""talkies"", this same short was re-made by the team just a few years later with only a few small plot changes. LAUGHING GRAVY was essentially the same plot except that Stan and Ollie were trying to hide a cute puppy from their grouchy landlord--not a goat like in ANGORA LOVE. This whole goat angle is the worst part of the film. While you could understand the boys wanting to keep a cute little dog (after all, it is snowy outside), why exactly they bring a goat home is just contrived and pointless. According to the plot, the goat followed them home and so they got tired of shooing it away and kept it. Huh?!

Apart from being an unconvincing plot, the movie itself is pure Laurel and Hardy, with a familiar plot and familiar roles for the comedians. This film features quite a few laughs, but unfortunately isn't one of their better films to wrap up their silent careers. This aspect of their careers just seems to have ended with a whimper.",positive
"I can remember a college professor commenting as to how disturbing this film was, reflecting the apathy of adolescents (this was before Generation ""X"").<br /><br />In a way, most of us are products of the same consumer culture; these high school kids spend their time drinking, getting high and wondering what to do about the body left on a riverbank.<br /><br />What would they do today? Would things be different?. Some very important questions. There are some excellent scenes with Keanu Reeves, and the dysfunctional family he lives with; his 11 year old brother going out to get wasted; the mother has no idea what to do- spends her time drinking with her boyfriend.<br /><br />This film was a bit before its time in that it addresses the problems in lower class American society; these kids had no outlet; what is available for them in this dirt-water town? . All in all a few interesting social commentaries are presented, and there are no solutions. 9/10.",positive
"Going into the film, I completely purged any of the politics involved with it from my mind. This led to a MUCH better viewing experience and made the movie much more enjoyable for me. I heavily advise you to do the same. Now onto the actual review. I loved this movie because there's a lot of fun to be had. The action sequences are thrilling, well-paced and exciting. There is a bit of shaky cam but it's not so bad that the scene is incomprehensible. Every performance here is also very good. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury is better than ever and Ben Mendelsohn as Talos brought a lot of nuance to the role that I wasn't expecting. Now my only real complaint I have is that Brie Larson as Carol Danvers is good but either the script didn't giver her enough to do or some misdirection led to a bland performance from her at times. You can tell that she's having fun in the role but only during the action scenes. Larson and Jackson do have a fair amount of chemistry so the scenes with them are enjoyable and funny. I also appreciate that since this film is set in the 1990s, the connection to the greater MCU isn't apparent until the third act. The final shot put a smile on my face. Now that I think about it, there were several moments where I found myself smiling out of sheer excitement about what's happening on-screen. And the post-credits scene is no different. I won't spoil it but it does link Captain Marvel to the upcoming Avengers: Endgame, which is shaping up to be one of, if not the biggest cinematic experiences in history. With all that said, I really enjoyed Captain Marvel. It's fun, full of wonderful performances, and has some very exciting moments that hype me up for Endgame.",negative
"Loved this movie. It felt so fufilling to watch and thoroughly enjoyed it. It connected nicely to what was already established and during the movie, there was definitley alot of mystery where you had to decide, ""are they actually good or bad,"" and i loved that about the movie. Alot of funny moments. I would watch this again!",positive
This was a good movie! I loved the 90's references but also loved that it wasn't too much in your face. I knew nothing about Captain Marvel going into the story so I didn't have the mournful comic moments that some other reviewers have had. It was a good movie with a good story. I really liked Brie Larson. I thought she did great in the role and her and Sam Jackson together are always great on screen. I really enjoyed the villains in this movie and thought overall it held up against the other marvel films. Great addition!,positive
"I'm 14 years old and I love this cartoon. Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise make a great pair. This movie is really funny and I love the songs. My favorite songs are ""You can't keep a good dog down"" and that song about sharing, I think it's called ""What's mine is yours"". This was the last movie with Judith Barsi, who played the voice of Anne-Marie. My favorite character is Charlie but I find Itchy's voice is so fun to hear. Although some scenes I actually found scary, I still have a hard time watching the scene with Charlie's dream, and Carface scares the crap out of me. Other characters like King Gator I found really funny. The ending was adorable and was actually sad, made me cry a little. I give this movie 7/10.",positive

Stale acting from the main. Idiotic character development. Unbelievable how the Skrulls are portrayed. Set all the poor buildup aside and base this on just the product... horrible. Marvel phoned this one in. They know they have a captive audience and they are taking advantage of it with this garbage. ,negative
"I was bored, around 10pm, so I watched this movie. And I could not stop laughing. Everything was so ridiculous. The way the kids were acting like they were older than 11 just cracked me up. One of the kids had a ring, that supposedly killed people after 3 or so years. It gave me the impression that he wanted to be a gangster.<br /><br />It's pretty hard to take little kids seriously, especially when it has to do with eating worms. They act like everything is such a big deal, like if Billy (the main character) doesn't eat the worms then the world will end.<br /><br />This is a good movie for little kids (excluding the fact that a 5 year old says 'penis'), but not for teens or adults who don't want to waste their time.",negative
"I had the privilege of being one of the Still photographers on the set of ""Grand Champion"" and enjoyed every minute of the 42 days I worked on the movie. I have been in the Photography business for 25 years and have worked on 16 movies and I can't think of a time when I enjoyed providing my craft more. The Kids were wonderful to work with and little Emma Roberts has so much energy she's a real trip. She even grabbed one of my camera during the stockshow scene rehearsal and started shooting. Some of her images were used for PR. I could have made more money working for a production with a bigger budget but I doubt I would have had the fun and been around so many great actors and the great people of West Texas as I was.",positive
"The entire movie was very cliche. The characters, especially the titular character, were very underdeveloped except for the idea that she wants to beat the men that put her down. It was bad enough that even made me uncomfortable as a woman. The score was unremarkable, and the popular songs chosen did not fit the scenes they were in, completely taking me out of the movie. Too many things that are serious and have a history in the MCU were played as a â€śjokeâ€ť that didn't really land because of the acting. The fact that her powers were completely controlled as soon as she embraced them was contrary to every superhero journey we've seen so far. The feminist rhetoric obviously took prescient over the development of character and story entirely. She is too flawless to be relatable. All in all, this movie is a miss for me. ",controversial
"The good- a subtly displayed message of feminism that is not shoved down your throat and makes you aware of day-to-day sexism in society. They also had a black single mom and played her off without even any sense of token minority. Brie Larson and the beautifully de-aged Samuel L. Jackson were an outstanding on-screen combo. Coulson stolenthe show in his limited screen time. Ben Mendelson was great too, as was Goose the cat. nnThe bad: SO. MUCH. WASTED. POTENTIAL. Jude Law. The Star Force. Gemma Chan. The Kree. They were extras with no reason to care for them, no screen time, and no significance to the plot. The Skrulls were also absolutely wasted. The twist did not work AT ALL. The Skrulls were such great villains, and then...they werent? The shape shifting aliens had such importance in the comics and there were so many places they could have gone with it. All for nothing The action was bland the final battle was anticlimactic, and could hardly even be considered a fight. Also, Nick Fury losing his eye was almost as disappointing as Ben Kingsley in Iron Man 3.",negative
"Milo is a complete rip off of the 1992 slasher flick Mikey, if you actually check it up both films have the same tagline!But if you want to watch an incredibly funny film with absolutely no plot whatsoever......well then this is the film for you.The acting is terrible and the flashback scenes are overwhelmingly confusing. The story behind this atrocity is simple Milo Jeeder is a kid with serious family problems,his father is an abortion doctor who keeps unborn feoutus's in a jar (NICE!) and was desperate for a child of his own, he figured out a way to bring one of these aborted children to life and he named him.............

"Captain Marvel is a mediocre marvel movie. It for sure does not deserve an 80%. For me it would be in the 60% range. I think it has lack-luster special effects for a marvel movie considering how good the special effects have been in previous movies in the MCU. There is definitely virtue signaling occurring because Brie Larson is a woman. I think that she does a pretty good job as Captain Marvel, but much could be improved on. The movie's does not hold up to the marvel standard which is disappointing personally and I think that  the creative team could have done a better job with dialogue. As a whole the movie is okay. I hope with the release of Avenger: Endgame that it will clean up the character of Captain Marvel.",negative
Such a good movie with a great twist/tale on a pretty fantastic comic book series!,positive
"This movie was a letdown.  Maybe that's because Marvel had it so overhyped that it couldn't possibly reach those expectations, or maybe it's just because this movie is a forgettable experience.  I think the main issue is how unlikable Carol Danvers is.  She's literally the worst in the comics, and she isn't much better here.  Cocky, overconfident, and a bit rude, she really isn't a good protagonist and she doesn't change by the end of the film.  The story is even a little meh, and the only working part of this movie is Nick Fury and maybe the skrulls.  Otherwise, it's a passable movie since she isn't prominent in Endgame.  Nothing important happens here, just know she is overpowered.  ",negative
"The Woman In Black was a British made for TV movie which was first broadcast on the BBC on Christmave Eve of '89, and again in '92. I believe it made a round on American TV on A&E. It was released on VHS in Britain in the early 90's but went out of print. A U.S. company released it on DVD later, but that version also sold out. According to the website of the author of the book, the rights to the movie are now owned by someone else and that it won't be released again, and that there are unofficial bootlegs being sold on ebay.<br /><br />I first heard about this movie just recently on a message board and had to check it out. I found a copy on ebay for about 28 bucks. It's certain to be a counterfeit from a seller in the far east, even though the DVD says, ""made in Canada,"" ha ha. But it's a good copy, and you can't really fault the bootleg labels for releasing stuff that is rare, out of print, and lost in legal disputes.<br /><br />I love the movie. It's a period piece set in the 1920's, with all the very authentic and quaint British settings of that time. The Woman In Black is very atmospheric and dark. For the most part, the movie is very low-key, but effective and scary. There is no self indulgent gore, violence or much at all in special effects, but The Woman In Black is still able to create absolutely chilling moments. It's a chilling classic styled ghost movie. The movie itself looks like it could have been made in the 1930's except for the color. Without all the flash of all the modern horror movies, I'm afraid this film will always just be a lost gem. For me, it places itself as one of my all time favorites.",positive
"Main character has no development, nothing relatable like many other superheroes. In the case of female superheroes, the likes of Wonderwoman does the job far better, with a strong female lead. This was just bland and dull. The movie isn't helped by the comics not knowing what to do with the character either, so it was always going to struggle. It does have one redeeming feature, Nick Fury's relationship with a cat.",negative

"You might think that a show about regular teens with superpowers would be interesting, but it's far from that. Take the concept for example: the main character(s) have a big secret that they hide from they're peers. It's just like Hannah Montana and That's So Raven. Next, the acting is just average. Selena Gomez seems to be half asleep through many scenes. Lastly, the jokes are either cliché or boring. If they're not using they're colorful, yet strange dialog to make us ""laugh"", they are throwing various props around the room. I really wish this show would use more original and entertaining material. In conclusion, Wisards of Waverly Place is a disappointment.",negative
"A prequel done right. Simply put, it's not contrived, fan-serving drivel shoe-horning in popular characters at every chance.nnThe story was really complicated at the outset, but the movie did a great job in making it comprehensible. I really liked the action, I enjoyed the 90s vibe, and the comic fan in me was thrilled to see the Kree/Skrull conflict pictured on the big screen.nnThe only thing I don't like is the idiot controversy surrounding the film, as if it were a feminist banner. It isn't. It's just an enjoyable film that treats its protagonist (who happens to be a woman) like a layered, powerful character, same as many other Marvel superheroes. I disagree with the misogynists who hate seeing a powerful woman as much as with the ultra-orthodox feminists who see a lot of political agenda where there is none.",controversial

"Judging by some of the comments in IMDB, I was expecting an action movie - perhaps a dramatic one or a stupid one or a simple one or a comicy one, but essentially an action movie.<br /><br />Whatever it is that I watched, it certainly didn't feel like a movie. The story is simple and straightforward (even though the prologue tries to make it seem complicated). Take three interest groups: 1) the government 2) the rebels 3) a group of assassins.<br /><br />Now subtract the first (they never appear in the movie). Then simply let one of the assassins, the princess, become a rogue on a revenge trip. Add in a rebel love-interest with a guilty conscience. And you've got the ingredients.<br /><br />But they still did not manage to turn it into a story or a movie. Between some random action sequences and some odd visuals trying to be Sci-Fi on a low budget, what you're left with is a feeling of emptiness. The movie just does not feel like a movie, but a weird, incoherent, boring dream.<br /><br />Avoid.<br /><br />2/10",negative
"The movie seems shoe-horned into the MCU. So many discrepancies between the comics and this movie with respect to Captain Marvel/Miss Marvel and Mar Vell.nnThe plot and story was uninteresting. Why wasn't Captain Marvel introduced earlier in the MCU when the Kree were introduced?nnThe throwback 90s stuff is there but there's no heart or soul to it. They just give you references for nostalgia's sake. Stranger Things does a good job envoking the 80s in a more relevant way.nnNo need for the cat. nnHow did the Space Stone/Tesseract get from Howard Stark to Dr. Lawson? If there's a Kree war fleet threatening Earth/Midgard why wouldn't the Sorcerer Supreme or Thor come deal with that?nnI'd have rather seen Captain Marvel introduced or hinted during a Guardians of the Galaxy movie or mid-credit scene (instead of Adam Warlock that was James Gunn's own thing). Black Panther was introduced the right way that fits the MCU. This movie could have been so much more but I think it's a missed opportunity. nnCaptain Marvel fighting a more powerful enemy like Eternals, Celestials, Galactus, etc. as a set-up for Endgame would make Endgame more believable within the MCU.nnAlso, her power is derived from the Space Stone, which we've already seen Iron Man's suits are powered by an element derivative/from the Spade Stone. Maybe Captain Marvel's powers could have been based on a different Infinity Stone to have some diversity in the MCU?nnNow, if she is able to single handedly defeats Thanos wearing the IG then it will be a huge let down for Endgame.",negative
"I couldn't believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character. I laughed for days just thinking about this show. Having finally seen the pilot I guess I will stick around for a few more episodes. Assy is pretty funny and the whole crew of police show characters are around, but Assy is hard to understand and that was a little frustrating. Most of the humor revolves around the fact that the title character is literally a walking ass with nothing else but legs that sport socks with garters and feet with traditional wing tips. Assy drinks too much and ""plays by his own rules"" as you might have guessed. The only other funny moments are Assy shooting many,many people and spending time at home - in the bathroom. It is not Squidbillies funny, but it is worth a look.",positive

After watching the new episodes that aired for the past few weeks; I grew fed up with the show relying too much on random humor to be funny. South Park was right about FG dead on when they brought up the Manatees and the idea balls.<br /><br />And watching the show itself, I don't understand why my parents like it so much; there's nothing great about it.

"...but memorable because it includes an actor I actually recognize! James Horan is, by these types of movies' standards, Lawrence Olivier. He's given some decent performances on stuff like Highlander and various Star Treks, so it's kind of amusing, if mildly depressing, watching him degrade himself here. Okay, yeah, there's a plot. Horan's character and his wife are fighting, he's having an affair with a movie reviewer while trying to do his ""masterpiece"" film, and their guest decides to enjoy the wonders of stripping. But watching Horan is really the only enjoyment to be found here.",negative
"While not as bad as it has been made to be (I have seen MUCH worse), this is still a very lame movie. Basically a rehash of Siegel's ""Coogan's Bluff"", with the main difference being that Clint Eastwood's hat has more charisma than the whole of Joe Don Baker, an unappealing actor if there was one.<br /><br />However, Venantino Venantini is great (and great fun) as the bad guy, sort of a budget Vittorio Gassman. He is the main reason to sit through this steampile, as the rest of the cast deliver mostly terrible acting, specially the girl. Poor old Rossano Brazzi, hard to believe he was once a romantic lead (watch ""Mondo Cane"" to see him running away from women). Looking here like a second-tier Ben Gazzara, he's given next to nothing to do. It's all Joe Don's show, unfortunately. And all of it scored to generic 80's ""action movie"" music that couldn't be more boring.<br /><br />Greydon Clark can make good B-Movies (""Without Warning""), but here he trips, falls, breaks his nose and loses three teeth. Well, at least the Malta locations were nice, and there's Venantini to try to save the day. 3/10.",negative
"Now, Throw Momma from the Train was not a great comedy, but it is a load of fun and makes you laugh. The title may seem a little strange, but the entire movie isn't literally about that, although it is about something just as sinister.<br /><br />Danny De Vito basically wants to kill his overbearing mother, and fast forward a little bit, some random and funny events take place. The premise is quite funny, and the things that Billy Crystal and Danny De Vito get into were great.

Very good movie! It did drag in two sections in the second and third acts but it is definitely in the top third of Marvel Movies for me.

"Star Wars the last jedi is an amazing movie, full of surprises. Rian Johnson definitely went for a more intellectual approach with this entry, judging by the subtle influences riddled throughout. The action scenes are an incredible ode towards Three Outlaw Samurai, full shots often complimented by stunning imagery. While there is no big twist there are multiple moments of surprise and fan service which will surely make any true fan tear up or smile with joy as the nostalgia trips are strong with this one. The acting is worth mentioning especially in Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher (may she rest in peace) cases who gives the standout performances of their entire careers. The movie does have its problems, mainly story arcs that don't feel compelling enough and some of the new characters are just not that interesting, however the already established Rey, Kylo Ren, Luke Skywalker and Leia make up for this giving us an overall entertaining, endearing, Star Wars experience. I will also take a few moments to point out how disgusted I am at the bunch of people giving this movie 0,1,2 just to bring its score down. These are the bandwagon flag carriers which are the most damaging not only to the film fan community but also to the Star Wars community, giving us a prime example of immaturity and lack of composure and/or ability to have an opinion of their own. While this movie may not be perfect and all film is subjective, this is not a 0, the amount of beautiful looking shots, acting and the music alone raise this movie above any other average flick.",positive
"While there are definitely some entertaining moments in Captain Marvel, the film overall feels flat and rehearsed with a cobbled-together storyline. The filmmakers really try to make you care about what's going on by shoehorning in a connection to the MCU, but it was difficult to emotionally connect to the plot and characters. It's not a bad movie, it just doesn't bring anything really new to the table.",negative

Captain Marvel really fell flat for me. Brie Larson just doesn't feel right for the part. Her chemistry with Samuel Jackson was decent but felt lacking in other areas. The plot seems out of place with the over saturation of  nostalgia for the 90's era. It just felt forced. Not to mention all the problems it causes in the Marvel Universe timeline.

Characters growing matters a lot to me, and Captain Marvel made the movie bland with poor to no character development. She went from strong to stronger. No vulnerabilities, no nothing. Nothing to connect and say ""I was like her at one point"" - we just get thrown into a film with a character no one can relate to in their growth as a character/person because there was none.nnHere's to hoping the Russo brothers can get us invested with her character in Endgame.

Kind of just a really boring passable superhero movie. Main character was kinda two dimensional. Not a lot about it was super emotionally compelling. I feel like they tried to have this strong female character but they did so by making her stoic and kind of snarky instead of having a compelling physical or emotional obstacle for her to overcome and in turn be regarded as a strong character. I hate to say this but the movie's explicitly feminist agenda got in its way rather than helped construct a relatable and interesting female superhero. Black widow should've gotten a movie before captain marvel. Also a lot of this movie was really heavy handed. 90s references were forced. There was this part where younger versions of captain marvel stand up and look directly into the camera in this really overdramatized way as a way of making it look like she's overcoming some huge obstacle but it's so forced and so awkward and it doesn't work. Not everything is terrible though. Samuel l Jackson is great. The one green homie was cool. But the bad outweigh the good to me.   It sucks cus they could've done some really interesting things with this story but it's just forgettable. People will talk about this movie for a month and then stop.,controversial

"The film was disappointing. I saw it on Broadway with Bernadette Peters and she was outstanding. Maybe as she, herself graps on to the end of her musical career, her condtion of desperatation lands her in role that she flaunts, re-invents and triumps as her own. Bette's singing is always belted, always flat and lacking to show her ability as an actress. To be entertaining, this performance was dying for a stronger lead and a stronger cast, so that the others would be memorable in Bette's absence. Another criticism: she smiles directly into the camera every time she start singing! I know it is musical theater, but please leave some grace sociale-- Middler cannot perform like Liza or Streisand might in a retrospective tour - out of character and out of context.",negative

"I didn't like this movie. There's nothing more too it. This opinion of mine has nothing to do with any rude comments that the actress made before, or about this being the first female led MCU movie. I just didn't like the character of Captain Marvel much. She had no standout personality, no character development, no mistakes to learn from, nothing that made the character compelling or made me care about her. She only ever seems to have an emotional part of mind except for maybe a minute in one scene, and that's it. She never has a defining moment to show us who she is without her powers. Its those moments that tells us who the hero really is, and what makes them a hero. Its a major part of any superheros character. With Steve Rogers, the scene in the alley shows us everything we need to know about him, and we continue to see the same kid in the alley that stood up to the bully saying ""I can do this all day,"" throughout the entire franchise. For Tony Stark, we see plenty of him outside his suit, and why he does what he does in every movie. For Thor, there are plenty of scenes like the sacrifice in Thor 1, the Odin Scene in Ragnarok, and of course, the Thor-Rocket Scene in Infinity War. For Captain Marvel, there's nothing. The closest we get to something is when her friend gives a really well executed speech about who she is. But the problem is, were hearing it from someone else, instead of seeing anything. SHOW, not TELL. Captain Marvel has no arc in the story, is very condescending, and makes for a very boring lead character. The villains are boring as well. Yon Rogg is a generic boring villain, and we never really feel like there is a legitimate relationship between him and Captain Marvel for there to be any weight to their fight. The Supreme Intelligence is even worse. This is a useless, meaningless, bland villain that doesn't even have enough that stands out to even be considered a character. We know absolutely nothing about it. The standouts of the movie are Samuel L. Jackson as a younger, less cynical Nick Fury, and the Skrulls. Although there was only one thing I absolutely hated about it. The scene where Nick Fury loses his eye is terrible. In Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Fury said: ""Last time I trusted someone, I lost an eye."" This implied that his losing an eye was a pretty major thing and contributed to his character and why he didn't trust people. It could've been a pretty cool moment that they told us at some point down the line, but they decided to take out his eye in the most ridiculous way possible. He lost his eye just because he messed with an alien cat, and it scratched his eye. This scene felt like it was just played for laughs. This movie may have made a billion dollars, but that doesn't mean it was on its own merits. The main reason this made so much money was because many people felt they need to watch it in order to understand Avengers: Endgame. At this point, everyone was looking forward to the next MCU movie, and many people, including me, thought it would be great. Unfortunately it wasn't. This was a pretty huge disappointment.",negative
"New Year's Day. The day after consuming a few too many vodka martinis and Cosmopolitans mixed with a bunch of bubbly at midnight, my wife and I discovered the local cable company is offering up the digital specialty channels for free for the month of January. We had a choice - do we make use of the freebie channels or do we start watching the eight seasons of X-Files on DVD that we received from our daughter for Christmas?<br /><br />We elected for the digital freebie since the DVDs are going nowhere and we need something like ten twelve-hour days to watch all the X-Files beginning to end. The Drive-In channel was offering a horror classic three movie marathon: Asylum (1972), House of the Damned (1996) and The Pit and the Pendulum (1961). Asylum is well-reviewed here and the Pit and the Pendulum was on too late for us to watch which meant we could really only be properly critical for House of the Damned.<br /><br />To be honest, we tried to be serious about the movie since its stars have reasonably good acting credentials - Greg Evigan (William Shatner's over-written Tekwars) and Alexandra Paul (the only Baywatch babe who could act although she has the body of a ten-year-old boy). Unfortunately, we soon dissolved to giggles, under the influence of a little hair-of-the-dog, as we each shouted out the names of movies from which this dog borrowed its scenes: Poltergeist, The Shining, Hell House, House On Haunted Hill, Ghost Busters!<br /><br />The acting, especially by Evigan's real-life daughter, wasn't too bad considering the silly script they had to work with. The CGI, for 1996, was hilarious - at its worst point in the final scene when it should have been the most horrific it was so bad my wife and I dissolved in laughter.<br /><br />Overall: Acting 4/5, Script 2/5, SFX 0/5",negative

"CGI was typical for MCU but acting felt more TV worthy rather than epic quality.  Extremely difficult to connect with the heroine as it felt like she was three different personalities and her role and influence on the movie goers felt extremely forced.  Did they even read the comics and understand who Captain Marvel is?   I would say this is probably on par with Eric Bana's ""Incredible Hulk"" ... watchable but forgettable.  I go to the movies and watch sports to relax and chill ... don't force feed alternative motives in a movie when its not even that type of movie genre and leave politics out.",negative

Jennifer is being threatened by one caller who wants to do horrible things to her and she asks for his help along with several other ladies. Mack & Lenny have more time on their hands and often go to Miami, Fl. golf courses or hang out in a Sports Bar where all kinds of city things go on.

I watched it at home and have to say Larson's acting was pretty bland and the movie was pretty bad. The lack of emtions from the character make it difficult to like her and it was just a not a good marvel movie. If this is the face of the marvel Cinematic Universe than that universe is going to sink like a rock cause she has no charisma or range in her acting in this movie. The performance was robotic and it felt like they were telling a message over a story which just made it barely watchable.,negative
This film is disappointing on many levels. It retcons several points in the MCU and makes earlier movies kind of contrived. Why doesn't Nick Fury call Captain Marvel in any of the movies prior such as during Avengers I or II when stuff goes bad? It's bad writing and contrived. nnThe jokes in the movie are pretty cringy. I think it's a subpar Marvel movie and I'm worried for endgame. This makes me wish we got a Black Widow movie instead.nnThe writing in this movie was bad.,negative

"This epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew, a narrative depth superior to most novels, wonderful music, philosophy and a connection to LIFE that I find difficult to explain. To immerse oneself in Die Zweite Heimat is for me akin to a spiritual experience, similar to the awe one gets when looking at the stars in a clear night sky. The language, and use of both colour and monochrome segments adds to the dramatic impact. The film inspired me to go to Munich and visit some of the locations, including the Edgar Reitz office. From then on, I vowed to improve my German skills - after Die Zweite Heimat I feel almost German, as if I am in the head of the characters. I also try to match the piano playing of Henry Arnold (Hermann), but this is the one thing that will always elude me ! This drama is unparalleled and I have been fortunate to see it on BBC2 in the UK and SBS in Australia. The sequel, Heimat 3, is currently being filmed in Germany.",positive
"If you didn't see the movie, you really have no right to say anything. I saw the movie and I can honestly tell you it was mediocre at best.

The fx were ok, but the fight scenes were choppy and jumpy so a bit confusing in what they were trying to do. This editing trick is usually used when the actors are not very well trained. The story was boring with 90s references thrown at you to try and entertain you. The whole movie was actually stolen by a cat. I wished it could have been better but sadly it wasn't...I would rate it along the lines of Thor 2 or Iron man 3. Just not memorable at all.",negative

"Good. Not Great. But Good.nnCaptain Marvel is exactly the movie I thought it would be. A fun little self-contained adventure with subtle feminist themes that sets up Carol's appearance in the next Avenger's film. There's nothing spectacular about it. But I'm impressed with how well all the little pieces of the movie work together. How well crafted everything is, even if I can't exactly call it ""inspired"".nnYoung Nick Fury and Phil Coulson are a delight. The main Skrull villain stole the show. And the movie is filled to the brim with subtle, incidental humor. Relying more on it then on quips, which is a nice change of pace.nnThe feminist message is also refreshingly subtle. The movie never beats you over the head with the fact that Carol isn't taken seriously by anyone outside of SHIELD, not in space, nor in the Airforce. But it's a persistent theme. nnNor does it beat you over the head with the ""relationship"" between her and Maria. Is it Platonic? Is it Romantic? Who cares. It's two strong independent career women raising a daughter together amid a culture of misogyny and homophobia. And I love every minute of it.nnAs for Captain Marvel herself? She's a divisive character. Like Black Panther before her, she is the least interesting part of her own movie. This is half because Brie Larson is a decent actress, but she's not Samuel L. Jackson. And half because her character is very subdued. Carol spends half the movie in a fugue state, suppressing her emotions while struggling with her tattered memories. And the other half fighting in an interstellar war with all the calm and confidence you would expect from a woman who flew experimental aircraft for a living.nnAnd it works. It all works. There's something for everyone. Returning fan favorites. A talented cast of character actors. A positive message. And a lead who stands out paradoxically, because of how little she stands out.",controversial

"All I can say is, this movie is made for the Lifetime Channel on TV, which means no solid characters, no particular style, weak acting all kinds of suggested sex but no-breasts and tushs (because boy, that would just catapult the film into the depths of sleaze wouldn't it?) but the heavily simulated sex, well, that's OK. <br /><br />When watching these films I have to ask myself, when will these types of TV channels and their advertisers ever grow up? I think these companies are actually way behind the times. They really have no clue what the younger generation is in tune with and if they knew they would demand we change. The whole point of many American TV channels like these seems mostly to regurgitate the same sanitized, diluded garbage over and over like a generic movie assembly line. I guess it works for them... or at least it has. Not sure about the future though. <br /><br />Don't bore yourself to death like I did. Seek out some real TV movies on HBO, Showtime, IFC, Starz, etc. Any channel that puts effort into their work and doesn't have to ask a priest what they can or cannot show.",negative

To the people who would say ""you're a male blah blah blah"" well, you have your opinion.. I have mine",negative
"Why this is called ""Mistresses"" is a puzzle, because it's about four women, three of whom aren't mistresses Except, wait. Ah, I see. It's a salacious title and we all have to merchandise I suppose. The series itself? Delicious. Most of the characters are hell bent on cutting metaphorical chunks off themselves. Great fun. Reminds me of LWT's 1976 miniseries ""Bouquet of Barbed Wire"", where every character and their dads wielded the machete.<br /><br />Siobhan (Orla Brady) is the only actual mistress and she's getting herself in proper trouble. Husband is infertile. So no chance of a baby there then. But at work, there's Dominic, played by uber-sexy Adam Rayner, who looks so good that there's no surprise when heavy lust breaks out. Dominic, it turns out, has no fertility problems. I expect his sperms do swashbuckling - probably each carries a little sword - and now Siobhan is inevitably pregnant that way instead. What Siobhan should do is to shut up good and tight, and go with - it's a miracle. What she actually does of course is say to her friends ""I have to tell my husband"". No you don't. Really, you don't. Stop. Stop!<br /><br />Katie (Sarah Parish) was a mistress once, for we learn that she'd had an affair with a married man before the series started. Unwisely, she's now taken up with his son. The father died of cancer and Katie, who is a doctor, helped him on his journey. So, she's an euthanasiarist, has had affairs with two of her patients and is sleeping with the son of the father in carelessly ignoring the incestuous undertones. It's not going to end well for Katie.<br /><br />Jessica is an experimental lesbian. She arranges events and she's busy doing a lesbian marriage as the series gets underway. She quickly gets into steamy eye exchanges with one of the brides Alex, played by Anna Torv, and the script hurries along to a lesbonk with great haste. However, it can't think of a good way of putting the two women in bed together, so it invents a very lame ""You're not having a hen night?! Well I can't let you get away with that. I'll organise one and the guests shall be .. Me!"", which achieves the result but isn't exactly Winterson. I thought script writers were supposed to earn their living. Lazy. Torv's interpretation of her character is good. Alex treats Jessica as possibly unsavoury and Alex's body language always points backwards when she's moving forward. Mind, once she's over the wall, in she happily goes, and unsurprisingly, for Shelley Conn is so mouth-watering that so would a good percentage of the human race given the chance.<br /><br />Which brings us to Trudi, who's a widow. Of course there should be plain people in a community but, if you're going to have a plain character, then you have to invent something to admire in them. It's quite possible to be a lump and engaging. However, Small's Trudi looks like one of those characters that Casting put prominently in a medieval crowd scene after the director said ""That's ridiculous, not every single character would be pretty"". More tellingly, you can't find anything to admire in her. Nothing. She's a turnip in a bowl of apples. Appallingly, she does ""sexy"" from time to time. I won't forget her appearance in bright red corset with stockings tucked into her crotch for a long time, and for all the wrong reasons.<br /><br />So, good, delinquent fun all round. There's easily enough material here for a second series and I hope that they do one. I trust they learn one lesson though. The characters never take off their underclothes in bed! Having spent abandoned hours of unbridled lust, afterwards they surface still wearing their bras, or keep the sheets tight wound round their naughty bits. After several episodes, no nipples yet and you can go beg for a cock. What's this? Early 21st century puritanism? So production team, are you listening? Your characters will solve some of their mental problems if they Do abandon as well as Talk it. At least they'll have more fun in the fun scenes, poor things. In a series dominated by either being in the bedroom, or wanted to be in the bedroom, or having just been in the bedroom, it's a bit silly, and jars a lot, that the characters bonk in their underwear.<br /><br />Overall. I was going to score 6 (top end medium), but the series does one trick that's rare enough. When each episode ends, you always want more, and you look forward to the next one with anticipation. So I score 7.",positive

"I wish there was a category to place this in other than Horror. It simply isn't. Granted it has it's horrific moments, however I don't feel that makes it a horror film. I will give that this movie could have been better. A million little things could have been changed to make it better.<br /><br />That having been said I love this movie. I'm often sad that people misunderstand the whole point of it. It has always been clear to me that the point of this movie was to say... things aren't always what they seem. Sometimes 'evil', isn't. <br /><br />Barker was at a Con I went to and he did a little talk then watch the movie thing. It was very interesting. Many things he wished to put in the movie couldn't be, and a chunk was cut out of the movie that he believed to be long lost. This was a chunk that helped shed light on Boone and his Girlfriend, as well as some other details.<br /><br />I know some people are bothered by not having more information about all of the 'breed' in the background, however I always felt that gave the movie a more 'real' fleshed out feel. I have read the novella this was based off of as well as many of the comics. Because of this, the movie just always seemed like a staging ground for the whole story. A much more involved story that sadly has never has a chance to live. <br /><br />Despite all of the flaws this movie might have I believe it has a lot to offer. The 'monsters' are wonderful, very imaginative. While the acting is sometimes a bit stiff there are some very quotable lines. Whenever I watch it I find something new. Keep and eye on Boones chest toward the end. At one point Decker stabs him and shortly after Boone falls on a card table. He ends up with a card stuck to his chest. This card stays there for a while even after Lori pulls the knife out. It stays there until Boone casually removes it. I love that. That was a lovely little detail I thought.<br /><br />Basically what I want to say is that... if you are looking for a horror movie, don't watch this. If you believe that at times men can be more evil than anything we have ever dreamed up. This is the movie for you. This is a movie about how men destroy what they don't understand or fear.",positive

However, the overall movie wasn't worth the money spent on it. If you are just going for the relevance of it in Avengers: Endgame, I would simply skip it, as the movie does nothing other than introduce the character, and show us just how badly she will invalidate everything in Avengers: Infinity War by tapping THANOS with her pinky, sending him flying into the moon, then reverse time, Superman style, so that no one dies.

None of the characters in this movie have that style or presence or whatever you want to call it. Take the lead actor, Lee J. Cobb. His rumpled, rolled-out-of-bed look is about as far from the dashing, smooth-talking noir archetype as you'll find. Or, take Jane Wyatt as the femme fatale as another example. This is one of the worst cases of miscasting I've seen in a while. She's just not convincing in the role.<br /><br />As for the plot, it's tired and lacks any real surprises or anything new for the genre.

I still get tears at the end when she finally has her moment of glory, no matter how faded that glory is.<br /><br />The Tulsa/Louise duet/dance is on now. Fabulous.<br /><br />Stephen Sondheim is the King of musical theatre.

"It's ok. Certainly some very entertaining moments, but majoritively bland with a lacking character development. Sure, a lot of things happen to her that are life changing, but her personality remains the same throughout. She mostly just ends up getting more power by having the confidence to try harder. Once she's is unbeatably powerful, she has a new found confidence. That's not real development because what fear is there to conquer once you punch a few spaceships out of existence and lazer cannon fire is bouncing off your chest. No need to get into the controversial aspects of the film as they can be summed up as distracting; whether regarding critics and propaganda beforehand, or story devices and writing in the actual film. Distracting throughout. If this had come out in phase one (which is no disservice to some of those great films), I'd be giving it a B with added concern about the direction of the MCU as a whole. I'd be lacking excitement for the future as this film disregards many aspects of the various Captain Marvel storylines in Marvel Comics and fails to delve into more interesting, cheaply teased references. It's as if they know what the MCU empire was built upon, but they are choosing to use it as cinematic Ă˘clickbaitĂ˘?. I fail to see the purpose of getting comic fans excited to see the great stories that have been hinted, only to let down their hopes and give them something unfamiliar. The MCU was built on comic geek feeling that Kevin Feige and co. had finally figured out how to tweek comics just enough to where they worked on the big screen, but also did poetic justice to their original content. Those geeks, like myself, force friends and family alike to come see these films with them...and it slowly took hold. Finally, a medium that made comics digestible for the general audience, and praise Oden, they lifelong comic fans finally would see their favorite stories on the big screen. This film simply fails to be an universally satisfying. As a stand alone film Captain Marvel is averagely entertaining, not a waste of the ticket price, and even holds its own if within MCU phase 1 - minus the lacking ode to the comics. But by today's MCU standards I rate it at 2.5/5 stars. That being said, it was scarcely close to being a top heir Marvel movie. Hard to say whether improving acting or writing would have the greatest benefit to the poor character development. What's more certain is that if aspects that make it controversial are replaced with original content, we'd have a much better film. The Captain Marvel from the comics is already written as an amazing, influential, and imposing female character whom no other character would even begin to doubt or take lightly. The film unfortunately fails in this respect as it feels the need to directly tell us how we are supposed to see her rather than simply showing us through how she responds to plot devices. It's good enough to where I'll watch it again as I do all Marvel films, but I'll be playing on my phone and only look up when she is kicking some butt. Final Score : 2.5/5",controversial
I felt like the movie was extremely good at first you see her fall throughout the movie and failing as a humanbeing and by the time the movie was ending she showed that she is strong enough regardless of her failures. Her powers were being controlled for the most part until she broke free and at the point you see what she is really capable. I think it was a really good movie.,positive
"Not too many people seem to know about this movie. Which is too bad because I think it's pretty good. Sure it is a bit cheesy at times and may have a predictable storyline. But the presentation of the movie is pretty well done. I think the casting is good with likeable actors/characters. Tom Selleck does a good job at playing a baseball player (go figure... not too much of a stretch I suppose) and Ken Takakura (from Black Rain) plays the chief (the coach of the Japanese baseball team). There isn't too much to complain about. It's just a light, easy-going, happy comedy and I recommend it.",positive

"Let's get the flaw out of the way right off the top - the movie should have been much longer. Ray Charles was a brilliant, fascinating man who lead a complex, challenging life. There was simply no way to fit it all - or even touch on it all - in a standard length movie. Given that, the makers of this film did an admirable (and I'm sure quite agonizing) job of putting together a film that could not tell the whole story yet managed to set forth a representative sampling of the man and his music. Ray Charles' strengths were evident throughout the film and his weaknesses were neither amplified nor sugar-coated. We could have wished for another hour chronicling his life after 1980, but I suppose that would have tended to turn the film into an homage and, while it would have also allowed for the resolution of several things that were left hanging at the end, on balance I guess it was better as presented.<br /><br />Now for the big question: what are the criteria for an Oscar? The wife and I have seen untold numbers of films in our years, but we immediately agreed that we have never seen a performance the equal of Jamie Foxx's. The line between actor and character was not blurred - but rather it disappeared completely. We had heard much of the hype before seeing the movie, but this was uncanny. Foxx WAS Ray Charles. You didn't watch the movie with the feeling that you were watching Foxx do an outstanding job of portraying Ray Charles - you watched it somehow believing or understanding that you were watching Ray Charles himself. I don't know how else to put it. We were completely blown away. I'll admit that we haven't seen all of the other performances up for an Oscar this year, but that really doesn't matter. Foxx took this to a whole nuther level, one which we've never witnessed before and doubt that we may ever see again. I can think of no other movie I've ever seen in which a person playing a part so completely and convincingly became the person portrayed. We salute you, Mr. Foxx. We understand that the awarding of an Oscar has to do with much more than the performance, but whether or not you win, we want you to know that you have done something that is in a class absolutely by itself and you should take enormous pride in your unparalleled achievement.<br /><br />P.S. The music was naturally great. I remarked to the wife that if there is one moment in the history of music to which I wish I could have been witness, it would have been the genesis (in Kansas City, wasn't it?) of What'd I Say? The film did a wonderful job with it - just wish I could've been there!",positive

"After ""Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman"" with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just as dangerous as men, there was obviously an open market for other movies to pick up and carry the torch and what more a lovely actress than Dorothy Provine from ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" to play the role. The downsize is that cute and blonde Provine may just be too sweet and innocent looking to step into Allison Hayes' size 50 shoes. This role really needed someone with an amount of smoldering sex appeal; Provine is more the girl next door type. She may have taken and done this role to prove she could be sexy, but the material lets her down. Lou Costello, however, proves he can do a movie without Bud Abbott feeding him lines and he even interjects a dramatic role in some of his scenes when he not turning to Gale Gordon as his front man for gags. Gordon, however, establishes that all he can be is blustery, perturbed and pushy, much the same character he creates later on ""The Lucy Show."" Charles Lane also plays the same role in everything he does: a straight man, and his screen time is limited. The special effects are convincing for the time, but I would have liked Dorothy to have been a little more than cheesecake and dressing and at least have been allowed to become dangerous. As the movie's lead character, she takes second billing to Costello who is in all of the movie with Dorothy several times vanishing like a sub-plot. The whole movie put together just can't decide if it's supposed to be science fiction, a comedy or just a parody of the Allison Hayes classic. There's a lot of good scenes, some very funny humor and some very ridiculous camp that affects the rest of the film. Still, I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one. If this movie had a chance to be remade today, I'd highly recommend Courtney Cox and Jason Alexander in the lead roles and allow me to completely re-write the original script. Courtney tops my lists of actresses who I believe could and should adequately play gorgeous giantesses; although, I have to admit that if either of the titanic beauties Allison or Dorothy came after me, I'd go quietly !!",positive

"Captain Marvel is the most boring addition to the MCU. Brie Larson's character (Carol Danvers) lacks so much personality that it's almost impossible to establish any connection with her role, not to mention Larson's performance of a superhero is bland as they come. She has zero character development throughout the film and there's nothing special about Brie Larson's performance that can't be done by a broad spectrum of actresses.n(SPOILERS AHEAD) The plot is second-hand, using the old ""trusted mentor was evil all along"" twist: predictable and disappointing.nThe film is practically a middle finger to those who enjoy the Marvel comic books; changing facts and stories to fit the cheesy story line, such as: Skrulls are simply a misunderstood race of alien refugees (political angle there), and Nick Fury lost his eye to a petty cat scratch.nI watched this film because 1) I really hoped it would exceed my low expectations and 2) I didn't want to miss any key details for Endgame.nHaving seen it, there was nothing relevant to Endgame and my low expectations were extremely disappointed.nAntman 2 looks like a good film in comparison; at least it was relevant.nAwful film. Not worth the time and money spent.nOn a final note, I pray Brie Larson's role in Endgame will be all but insignificant, because the Avengers that have been around for -+ years deserve to carry this saga to it's conclusion without being carried by an unfamiliar face.",negative

"Inexplicably, I watched this movie for the very first time just a couple of days ago, and understood from the very beginning what all the fuss is about. This movie held my attention from beginning to end, and ran me through the whole range of emotions (and might have helped me discover a few I never knew about.)<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman absolutely shines as Ted Kramer. He is absolutely convincing as a man having to juggle at least three different challenges in life: jilted husband, workaholic ad executive and loving father. Meryl Streep as Joanna Kramer was less central to the movie simply because Joanna was absent for a good part of it, but when she was on screen she gave Hoffman a run for his money. The true standout, though, (in my opinion) had to be young Justin Henry as Billy Kramer. Children are always the innocent victim in a marital breakdown, and Justin seemed absolutely natural and completely believable in this role as he deals with the conflicting emotions around his mother and his adjustment to life with Dad, only then to have the confusion around why he should have to leave his Dad when it was his Mom who walked out on him. Young Justin didn't seem to miss a beat in this very difficult role.<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent, Oscar-worthy movie whose only weak point was what I thought to be a truly disappointing decision to go for the sappy and happy ending, which was totally unrealistic considering the destructive custody battle Ted and Joanna had gone through.

"The year 2005 saw no fewer than 3 filmed productions of H. G. Wells' great novel, ""War of the Worlds"". This is perhaps the least well-known and very probably the best of them. No other version of WotW has ever attempted not only to present the story very much as Wells wrote it, but also to create the atmosphere of the time in which it was supposed to take place: the last year of the 19th Century, 1900  using Wells' original setting, in and near Woking, England.<br /><br />IMDb seems unfriendly to what they regard as ""spoilers"". That might apply with some films, where the ending might actually be a surprise, but with regard to one of the most famous novels in the world, it seems positively silly. I have no sympathy for people who have neglected to read one of the seminal works in English literature, so let's get right to the chase. The aliens are destroyed through catching an Earth disease, against which they have no immunity. If that's a spoiler, so be it; after a book and 3 other films (including the 1953 classic), you ought to know how this ends.<br /><br />This film, which follows Wells' plot in the main, is also very cleverly presented  in a way that might put many viewers off due to their ignorance of late 19th/early 20th Century photography. Although filmed in a widescreen aspect, the film goes to some lengths to give an impression of contemporaneity. The general coloration of skin and clothes display a sepia tint often found in old photographs (rather than black). Colors are often reminiscent of hand-tinting. At other times, colors are washed out. These variations are typical of early films, which didn't use standardized celluloid stock and therefore presented a good many changes in print quality, even going from black/white to sepia/white to blue/white to reddish/white and so on  as you'll see on occasion here. The special effects are deliberately retrograde, of a sort seen even as late as the 1920s  and yet the Martians and their machines are very much as Wells described them and have a more nearly realistic ""feel"". Some of effects are really awkward  such as the destruction of Big Ben. The acting is often more in the style of that period than ours. Some aspects of Victorian dress may appear odd, particularly the use of pomade or brilliantine on head and facial hair.<br /><br />This film is the only one that follows with some closeness Wells' original narrative  as has been noted. Viewers may find it informative to note plot details that appear here that are occasionally retained in other versions of the story. Wells' description of the Martians  a giant head mounted on numerous tentacles  is effectively portrayed. When the Martian machines appear, about an hour into the film, they too give a good impression of how Wells described them. Both Wells and this film do an excellent job of portraying the progress of the Martians from the limited perspective (primarily) of rural England  plus a few scenes in London (involving the Narrator's brother). The director is unable to resist showing the destruction of a major landmark (Big Ben), but at least doesn't dwell unduly on the devastation of London.<br /><br />The victory of the Martians is hardly a surprise, despite the destruction by cannon of some of their machines. The Narrator, traveling about to seek escape, sees much of what Wells terms ""the rout of Mankind"". He encounters a curate endowed with the Victorian affliction of a much too precious and nervous personality. They eventually find themselves on the very edge of a Martian nest, where they discover an awful fact: the Martians are shown to be vampires who consume their prey alive in a very effective scene. Wells adds that after eating they set up ""a prolonged and cheerful hooting"". The Narrator finally is obliged to beat senseless the increasingly hysterical curate  who revives just as the Martians drag him off to the larder (cheers from the gallery; British curates are so often utterly insufferable).<br /><br />This film lasts almost 3 hours, going through Wells' story in welcome detail. It's about time the author got his due  in a compelling presentation that builds in dramatic impact. A word about the acting: Don't expect award-winning performances. They're not bad, however, the actors are earnest and they grow on you. Most of them, however, have had very abbreviated film careers, often only in this film. The Narrator is played by hunky Anthony Piana, in his 2nd film. The Curate is John Kaufman  also in his 2nd film as an actor but who has had more experience directing. The Brother (""Henderson"") is played with some conviction by W. Bernard Bauman in his first film. The Artilleryman, the only other sizable part, is played by James Lathrop in his first film.<br /><br />This is overall a splendid film, portraying for the first time the War of the Worlds as Wells wrote it. Despite its slight defects, it is far and away better than any of its hyped-up competitors. If you want to see H. G. Wells' War of the Worlds  and not some wholly distorted version of it  see this film!",positive
"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I know a lot of people are going into this like ""this is feminist propaganda!"" Even the director and Brie Larson, herself confirmed this thought. But, the feminist themes I thought were more subtle than movies like Wonder Woman, which had a more positive reaction but I thought was disappointing after hearing all the hype. This movie isn't tied down with a forced love interest, people weren't telling her she can't do what she wants because she's a girl but her frustration does work with a girl's frustration,  henseforth a feminist theme. I never felt the movie dragged. I see a lot of people saying ""if a cat steals a scene, WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE MOVIE, HMMMMM!?!?!?"" It says that it was funny and sometimes physical humor works. People loved Groot, pretty much same concept but a CG tree. I also thought the anti-military and blind patriotism theme works so well. I feel like people have a real hard-on for hating this movie and i don't get it. Brie Larson and Samuel L Jackson's chemistry on screen was great and the character development for both of them was intriguing and had me asking for more of her and I'm looking forward to her role in Endgame.",controversial

This character could have legit been introduced on Guardians of the Galaxy or even Ant Man. And unfortunately, there is no power scale to this character. This movie did not provide us with a reason why she is really needed to defeat Thanos. Her origin is really bad. I dont know to blame either the writers, or director but the main character is extremely boring and not sympathetic. This movie should have been helmed by Taika Waititi, or James Gunn.

"If you've ever seen an eighties slasher, there isn't much reason to see this one. Originality often isn't one of slasher cinema's strongpoints, and it's something that this film is seriously lacking in. There really isn't much that can said about Pranks, so I'll make this quick. The film was one of the 74 films included on the DPP Video Nasty list, and that was my only reason for seeing it. The plot follows a bunch of kids that stay behind in a dorm at Christmas time. As they're in a slasher, someone decides to start picking them off and this leads to one of the dullest mysteries ever seen in a slasher movie. The fact that this movie was on the Video Nasty list is bizarre because, despite a few gory scenes, this film is hardly going to corrupt or deprave anyone, and gorier slashers than this (Friday the 13th, for example) didn't end up banned. But then again, there's banned films that are much less gory than this one (The Witch Who Came from the Sea, for example). Anyway, the conclusion of the movie is the best thing about it, as although the audience really couldn't care less who the assailant is by this point; it is rather well done. On the whole, this is a dreary and dismal slasher that even slasher fans will do well to miss.",negative

"""Yes, Georgio"" is a light-hearted and enjoyable movie/comedy that contains beautiful settings and beautiful music. It's not my favorite movie but it is a movie I have enjoyed seeing more than once. Some reviewers suggested if one wished to enjoy Pavarotti, they would likely be better served by picking up an opera DVD. Although, a full opera might be a better representation of Pavarotti's operatic talents, oftentimes, an opera requires costumes and has story lines that completely hide the appearance and nature of the person. ""Yes, Georgio"" permits Pavarotti to use his speaking voice and to exhibit a personality and character in ways an opera would not.<br /><br />Many reviewers seemed to find the story unbelievable; I don't agree. Enormously talented people can be both self-centered and charming - charming enough to captivate intelligent and beautiful people. Additionally, people who are very different from one other often gain insights about themselves and grow in positive ways from interacting with people who stretch them or take them in directions they might not have chosen on their own. Both Georgio and Pamela become more open to unexplored parts of themselves in relationship with the other.<br /><br />Relax and let yourself go into a visually and aurally rewarding film with Pavarotti at the peak of his vocal abilities. The ending scenes from Puccini's Turandot alone are worth the time to get there.",positive

"Mario Racocevic from Europe is the only user who has posted a comment so far and covers the major points to the film.Yet again another difficult film to purchase in the UK.I had to go through ""Midnight Video"" who have a Swedish branch.I went to the post office and bought by mail order this and a similar title at only SKR30 a title.<br /><br />This film goes under many ""a.k.a's"" depending on when and where it is marketed.I had previously purchased ""The Bloodsucker leads the Dance"" (which you will find if you search on Imdb under ""people"" and input ""Krista Nell"").The actor who plays the Count on his private island in the latter film had his words dubbed from Italian into English by an actor with an unmistakably mournful and rather tired sounding voice.I smiled when I heard this same voice dubbing on the English soundtrack as the police inspector who is investigating the murder of the prostitute killed in the copse in the subject film.My choice of course was to see another outing by the delicious Krista Nell.<br /><br />There are quite a few rather inconsequential sub plots in the movie involving blackmail/extortion, sleazy affairs with girlfriends' mothers, a motor cycle chase resulting in a gangland hit, a gangrape by a ""client's"" motorcycle friends, sleazy photography, cross dressing by transvestites etc. which give a flavour to this film summarised in a word - SLEAZE, (but artistic sleaze).The aforementioned contributor liked this film but the lowly rating suggests other Imdb fans did not albeit without explaining their ""wheres and whyfores"".Personally I thought there were too many subplots and not enough put into the main story and the relationship of these subordinate characters to the central plot and the development of their screen characters.Also a professional film editor was sorely needed as some of the scenes appeared to last far too long, having made their point, so that the film appeared to drag in places; e.g. the scene of the dancing transvestite.Krista Nell appears in one fruity scene with a client but this too is but a vignette and I was left wanting more from her, the director and the screenplay.<br /><br />I love the political incorrectness shown in older films (this is 30 years from its making) e.g. smoking in offices and the way some characters react to each other in the office!I would suggest 4/10 as a more realistic rating and I have awarded it as such.",negative

Flashy photo and clever editing is the word of Leclerc, strongly helped by Roy Dupuis who's dythirambic in the lead role.<br /><br />The plot is about Alexandre Tourneur, veterinary in his 40's who just woke up from a coma after being unplugged by somebody unknown. Tourneur is struggling to remember who hit him as he was ending a deer's sufferings on the road. Throughout the struggling, he has weird behavior and it seems like something took over him.<br /><br />Not spooky, but very mysterious and well played movie.

Last half of the show did indeed pick up and got interesting but no where near what I was expecting from a MCU movie.

"The above seemed a much more appropriate title when me and my suicidal underlings decided to watch this masterpiece of modern bullshit <br /><br />Erotic,Scary, Suspenseful, Well thought out, these are all the things this film fails to be.<br /><br />It is however incredibly funny, the slow sound effects and bad dubbing add to this to make one of the greatest comedies I have seen in recent years. And yet this film doesn't even try to be funny and that is one of the movies grand achievements, it becomes a comedy without even attempting to amuse.<br /><br />Throughout the film an old guy who looks amazingly like Santa Claus goes around ploughing over zombies and smashing vampires into the ground. This made me fail to believe the films title, if this was vampires vs zombies why were the vampires and zombies not fighting? Oh well whatever, besides there were more flaws to this rental than the title. Such as this one; there has been a virus sweeping through America creating zombie like beings who go around acting a lot like your average tourist. And yet there's only four zombies in the entire film. Another problem is besides one shop everywhere is deserted. Surely you'd see zombies roaming about in the woods or in the background a bit. In fact I believe they just drove around in a circle of forest over and over again since they didn't have a high enough budget to film in a wider location, that or the director didn't want to waste his precious time filming in different areas of wood he was to busy sitting in a trailer jerking off to be bothered with such trivial matters.<br /><br />In fact the director had so much fun doing this that he didn't have enough time to hire a big enough cast or even an editor. And so he told the eight members of the cast to dress up as different people and try not to act inconspicuous, whilst I assume he changed his name and began randomly snipping at the film reels ""editing isn't a hard job anyway right?"" The only reason this ""movie"" found it's way into our bag was because somehow we got it confused with Freddy vs Jason, strange how these things happen isn't it. And the only way we made it though the night was by strapping gas masks on and bolting them to our skulls to avoid the stink of this nauseating mess.<br /><br />Oh yes we did laugh at the end, but I'm sure one does that a lot when he has lost his sanity...................",negative

"Just watched this movie over the weekend, and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed it. The 2 Italo American actors are excellent as usual (Michael Imperioli and John Ventimiglia). It is obvious that the director was influenced by 2 great films of the past directed by Italians. Primarily he was influenced by Dino Risi and his film IL SORPASSO. It is the story of 2 young men who meet by chance and become friends. One is extroverted and the other is introverted. They enjoy the whole day together and by the end of the day, the shy one learns that there is more to life than his usual routine monotony. The same thing happens to Albert De Santi. Unfortunately, IL SORPASSO has a very similar ending and this apparently influenced the director of ON THE RUN because he uses the same technique but with a twist. I had expected something but was surprised to see that it turned out to be the opposite. If you watch both movies you will understand. The other film that influenced the director is AFTER HOURS directed by the great Italian American Scorsese. I highly recommend all 3 movies !!",positive

"If you have not heard of this film, it follows two Sudanese refugees from a refugee camp in Africa to America, where they convince themselves they will find success and riches. Life is harder than expected in the states, and this film beautifully captures the frustration felt when things are not going right. The lives are captured so well many moments seem scripted because they're so perfect. Whether it be on the job, at school, or the time in between, the two boys, Peter and Santino, are very honest with the filmmakers, and make some very thought-provoking comments about life in the states. It's one of the only documentaries I can recall that, when it ended, I wanted it to go on for another two hours. It might be difficult to find this movie cause it didn't get great distribution, but check your local ""art house"" or independent theater and give this one a go (side note, if you're reading this when it's already on video then definitely it's worth a rent).

I burst into tears at the cinema when the boy turned into the Eagle and always wanted to see the film again. When we got home we had a Roast chicken dinner and I got the wish bone and guess who I wished to be?

"My review keeps getting removed. First I was pleasantly surprised by how little agenda pushing there was in this movie, after the way it was marketed. Can't say when but there is a scene that reminded Me of a famous  Indiana Jones scene. That and a few of the jokes worked. The rest of the movie felt rushed, and it also felt as if the actors should have spent more time training for their roles. Like the fight scenes were poorly lit, and jumped around a lot (ie Iron Fist). And then there was the complete lack of the edge of the seat feeling you should get when the hero is in a major fight...it was not there, every fight felt like playing a video game with god mode on...you can't lose.

"Two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of Mormons who are bound for a valley where they can settle and live in peace. The scenes of the corral in the town where Ward Bond and Ben Johnson negotiate prices, and Bond introduces the idea of them (Johnson and his partner played by Harry Carey Jr.) leading the train to this valley, are some of the best in the film, as Johnson, a real cowboy, whittles a piece of wood while he banters with Bond. Once on the trail they come upon Joanne Dru, who maybe John Ford saw in Red River, and offered her a much better part in this film. In the Morman train are a number of notable characters. The Mormans are a peaceable group who are challenged along the way by a truly lowlife group of outlaws. In their case (the outlaws), in the case of the people on the train, and later a band of Navajos whom they encounter, and in the well written characters played by Ben Johnson and Ward Bond, the film completely evades stereotypes, while the camera seems to spend as much time giving the viewer the big picture of Monument Valley framing the train as it moves along with a few water crossings along the way, in stunning black and white and then coming back to what's happening in this rolling community, all to the accompaniment of the beautiful vocalizations of the Sons of the Pioneers.",positive

"Forgettable. Nothing sells Danvers to the viewer as a character they are supposed to care about. The whole film lacked any cohesive visual style or themes, which is disappointing seeing what has also come from the studio. My biggest gripe is that there were no stakes for Danvers in the whole film. By the climax, she can easily defeat any opponent without much effort. Brie Larson's lack of emotion throughout coupled with the character's flavorless presentation really make this movie the one MCU film to pass and make me worried for the MCU going forward if they are determined to push Captain Marvel into front and center of the new phase 4 movies.",negative
"While this film certainly does possess the stench of a bad film, it's surprisingly watchable on several levels. First, for old movie fans, it's interesting to see the leading role played by Dean Jagger (no relation to Mick). While Jagger later went on to a very respectable role as a supporting actor (even garnering the Oscar in this category for 12 O'CLOCK HIGH), here his performance is truly unique since he actually has a full head of hair (I never saw him this way before) and because he was by far the worst actor in the film. This film just goes to show that if an actor cannot act in his earlier films doesn't mean he can't eventually learn to be a great actor. Another good example of this phenomenon is Paul Newman, whose first movie (THE SILVER CHALICE) is considered one of the worst films of the 1950s.<br /><br />A second reason to watch the film is the shear cheesiness of it all. The writing is bad, the acting is bad and the special effects are bad. For example, when Jagger and an unnamed Cambodian are wading through the water, it's obvious they are really just walking in place and the background is poorly projected behind them. Plus, once they leave the water, their costumes are 100% dry!!! Horrid continuity and mindlessly bad dialog abounds throughout the film--so much so that it's hard to imagine why they didn't ask Bela Lugosi or George Zucco to star in the film--since both of them starred in many grade-z horror films. In many ways, this would be a perfect example for a film class on how NOT to make a film.<br /><br />So, while giving it a 3 is probably a bit over-generous, it's fun to laugh at and short so it's worth a look for bad film fans.",negative

"Disgused as an Asian Horror, ""A Tale Of Two Sisters"" is actually a complex character driven psychological drama, that engulfs the viewer into the problems of a seemingly normal family. I was really surprised at the depth of this movie. Director Ji-woon Kim's decision to focus more on telling a story rather than providing cheap scares, has proved a correct one. Creating one of the most ingenious new horror movies.<br /><br />""A Tale Of Two Sisters"" tels the story, as it's name suggest of two sisters Su-mi and the younger Su-yeon, who after spending time in a mental institution return home to their father and apparently abusive stepmother. From then on we witness how the sisters deal with their stepmother's gradually rising aggression and erratic behavior. To say what would happen next would be to be spoil the entire experience. So I'll just leave it at that.<br /><br />The plot is very tightly written. With the characters nicely fleshed out. Ji-woon Kim's focus on a small cast offers a much more detailed view on them and their relations to one another. Furthermore each of the four main cast has a vastly different role and type of character. From the protective Su-mi, the weaker Su-yeon, the visibly uninterested father to the stepmother's frantic and later deadly behavior. There is great sense of mystery, with a lot of the plot not revealed up into the end and even after that the movie still leaves a great room for interpretation. Even after watching it once, the viewer will be compelled to see it at least once more so that he can gain a better understanding to it.<br /><br />The actors superbly fit their roles. It is especially hard to create strong, emotional scenes in psychological movies but it is a great joy when one succeeds in creating them and this is a prime example of such a feat. Ji-woon Kim's direction is slow paced and gripping, building up tension for the film's horroresque scenes. While few in number those moments are strong and quite frankly terrifying. The cinematography and score are top notch further helping to establish an atmosphere fitting that of a psychological film.<br /><br />""A Tale Of Two Sisters"" is a demonstration how the horror genre is in fact so much more than a simple thrill ride. With it's strong focus on character and mystery this is one complex movie that could easily seduce you in watching it again and again just so that you can understand it better.",positive

"Serviceable but not groundbreaking.  Good but not great.  The biggest problem face by Captain Marvel is that Marvel Studios has lost their ability to tell a story that isn't ""just"" a superhero movie.  For example, Captain America was a war movie, Ant-Man was a heist movie, Incredible Hulk was a cat and mouse chase movie.  They were all different types of movies that just happened to be about superheros.  Captain Marvel isn't that.  It's just a superhero movie.nThere's a lot of good stuff in it.  Ben Mendelsohn is very relatable, Jude Law is great, and Annette Bening and Sam Jackson show why they are Hollywood legends.  However, there's plenty lacking too.  Brie Larson's emotional range goes from flat to slightly concave.  The action is unconvincing (I get it, she's a super bad ass. But she's still fighting a team of trained killers.  She should be having more trouble than she does).  And the script would have benefited from a person who had a passing knowledge of the Captain Marvel story and the Kree/Skrull War.nAll in all, it was fine.  Better than Black Panther and Iron Man 3, but not by much.  If this had been released 3 years ago, it probably would have been a great movie for what Marvel was doing at that time, but now it's just lacking.",positive
"Mention Bollywood to anyone with a slight familiarity with the genre and the images usually conjured up are of tacky, over the top musical numbers peopled with costuming that makes Vegas seem a bastion of conservatism.

Willard Carroll's romantic comedy Marigold, however takes a different tack. It is not a nudge-nudge wink-wink look at those silly people and their clueless antics but a sincere appreciation of Bollywood for its vitality, its lack of irony and self-consciousness.<br /><br />It is obvious that the director has a tremendous affection and respect for Bollywood while at the same time is bemused by its kitschier aspects. And if you have a familiarity with Bollywood, you can appreciate what he does here in making a true hybrid of Bollywood and Hollywood movie conventions. From one of the opening shots, a flashback of the Salman character as a child by the sea, talking with his grandmother (played by Helen! - how many Salman movies start with this same premise?) to the flashback sequence that is incorporated into the movie that Marigold and Prem has been filming, anyone who has seen enough Bollywood movies will recognize these references. The story itself incorporates tried and true conventions from both Hollywood and Bollywood as well  the fish out of water meets duty-to-one's-family-at the expense of personal fulfillment. The structure of the film follows the typical Bollywood plot line of the more comical set up of the first half giving way to a more dramatic resolution of the second. Yet ultimately the sensibility of the film is that of Hollywood, with its understated, wry humor and its story of a woman learning to believe in herself, to reach self-affirmation.<br /><br />You couldn't have a movie inspired by Bollywood if there weren't any musical numbers and this movie does not disappoint with seven of them. Unlike Bollywood, however, the songs do not pop out of nowhere and transport its characters to a European locale or Goan beach; they exist as musical numbers that are part of the film that is being made, reminiscent of how musical numbers were justified in Busby Berkeley movies as being part of a stage show. Or they come out of a situation where music already has a reason to be there  a sexy nightclub scene where Prem teaches Marigold to dance or a beach scene where there are musicians (including a cameo from the playback singer Shaan) performing. All reflect the emotional state of the protagonists at that point in the movie. Often the music will take a conventional song from one genre and put a twist on it from the other. So in one of the highlights of the film where Marigold comes into her own, the song picturazation is fairly typical of its genre  the female star singing and dancing among a line of women  but in this case it's blond Ali Larter looking like a total natural Bollywood film star, emoting and lip synching to the Hindi lyrics with no subtitles.<br /><br />Also synonymous with Bollywood are sumptuous visuals and Marigold fulfills that aspect beautifully thanks to some of the top talent working in Bollywood today. The cinematographer is Anil Mehta who was also the cinematographer for Lagaan and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. The choreographer is Vaibhavi Merchant and production designer is Nitin Desai, both from Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Devdas. You can really see the influence of Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam on this film  in fact, the illuminated floor in one of the numbers was originally from Dholi Taro Dhol, which coincidentally has an embedded Marigold pattern.<br /><br />As for the cast, Carroll obviously has a penchant for spotting acting talent as evidenced by Playing by Heart  one of the first movies for both Angelina Jolie and Ryanne Phillippe. And in this film he again hits the mark with Ali Larter. One of the main reasons the film works is because of Larter. She makes a bitchy, unappealing character sympathetic and her subsequent transformation believable and she is smart, funny, and sexy because she is smart and funny. She and Salman share excellent chemistry and that is one of the film's biggest strengths.<br /><br />Salman Khan plays the role of Prince Charming here as filtered through his iconic role as Prem. This is old school Prem, however, so expect a quiet, subdued Salman - those used to him in his usual stripping avatar may be disappointed  or relieved! It's a sincere and sensitive performance from him marred only by poor enunciation of his English lines.<br /><br />With a refreshing lack of cynicism and unabashed embrace of romantic love, the film is a love letter to Bollywood and Hollywood movies of yore.",positive

"Absolutely corrosive! Director Arthur Hiller and writer Paddy Chayefsky dismantle the American hospital system with this wicked comedy/drama/whodunit. The hospital depicted here is fraught with problems...from protesting neighbors to irate patients to a potential serial killer on the loose. George C. Scott is the top doctor who, on the brink of his own nervous breakdown, gets involved with free-spirited Diana Rigg and her wacky father Barnard Hughes. Alternately depressing and uproarious, THE HOSPITAL features some of the most acid-tinged dialog imaginable (note how Scott describes his love making session with Rigg). It also has a lot of great vignettes: Scott berating head nurse Nancy Marchand after one of here underlings accidentally kills a doctor; daffy administrator Frances Sternhagen trying desperately to collect insurance info from a waiting room full of sick people; Scott getting sobering advice from the hospital psychiatrist after telling him of his woeful home-life. All of the acting is first-rate. Scott and Rigg are dynamite and Hughes is a real surprise. The movie is a masterpiece with Chayefsky's script earning a well-deserved Oscar (over such stiff competition as KLUTE & Sunday, BLOODY Sunday). The opening narration is priceless.",positive
"In the world of ""shorts"" (most of which aren't), this film is a gem.<br /><br />A quiet, concise peek into the world of a young woman who's a reader for a blind woman, here the stellar Elizabeth Franz - this film bears the textures, layers and visual storytelling of a sumptuously painted still life.<br /><br />The dialogue is minimal, the cinematography is stunning, and the direction sure, clear and compelling. I saw this film in a film festival held in a loud and crowded Tribeca bar - and within the first two minutes (and for the first time that night), the crowd fell quiet.<br /><br />That says it all.",positive
"It's not easy making a movie with 18 different stories in it. Although 18 different international directors took the challenge, not everyone of them is good, some of them even boring. But in his entity, ""Paris, je t'aime"" is breathtaking, showing that, as ""Love Actually"" put it, 'love is all around', especially in the city of love. Here's a resumé (I'll try to make at as spoiler-free as possible) of the 18 different stories.<br /><br />MONTMARTRE - kind of a dull opening sequence, nothing really special about it. A man finds a parking spot, and sees a lot of odd couples walking by, wondering why he can't find a girl. And than, suddenly, a woman faints next to his car...<br /><br />QUAIS DE SEINE - another dull sequence, about three teenage boys who are searching for some 'piece of ass', when suddenly a Muslim girl trips right in front of them, receiving help from one of the boys. Really basic, but with a sweet heart to it.<br /><br />LES MARAIS - this was a huge disappointment! Although a love story between two boys with an artsy background could have been interesting by the great Van Sant. Eventually, everything that comes AFTER the monologue by Ulliel is good, everything before it is just annoying.<br /><br />TUILERIES - an entertaining sequence by the Coen brothers. Buscemi - without even saying one word - is mesmerizing and the whole sequence is just hilarious. This one kept me hooked until the very end, and this one also gets you truly hooked to the movie.<br /><br />LOIN DU 16IEME - a beautiful story too, even if the execution is poor, the heart is there. It's the story of an Hispanic woman who drops her child off, early in the morning, to take care of another suburban baby. Beautiful.<br /><br />PORTE DE CHOISY - this segment has got to be the strangest and weirdest from the whole movie. Some kind of shampoo salesman arrives in a Chinatown-lookalike place in Paris. If I understood it correctly, the story is about inner beauty, but I think I'm wrong.<br /><br />BASTILLE - a truly wonderful sequence. A man meets with his wife at a restaurant, to break up with her, so that he can run off with his mistress. But the wife has some devastating news. Pretty basic, but truly sad and beautiful! PLACE DES VICTOIRES - a sad sequence as well. Juliette Binoche plays a grieving mother. One night, she wakes up hearing her dead child. When she arrives at the location, a cowboy tells her she can give one last good-bye to her child. One of the best segments! TOUR EIFFEL - two mimes who fall in love could have been great, but, even though it has some nice cinematic tricks, the story isn't intriguing and not funny at all.<br /><br />PARC MONCEAU - a truly original and great sequence, one of the best of the movie! A young girl and an older man discuss their future and her fear for a certain man... Cuaron does a great directing job, and the actors are amazing! QUARTIER DES ENFANTS ROUGES - an American actress (Gyllenhaal) falls in love with her drug dealer. a beautiful segment again, with a very sad ending PLACE DES FETES - a woman comes to a homeless man, he starts talking romantic to her... because she is the love of his life. Beautiful, sad, shocking, romantic,... Place des Fêtes will make everyone cry.<br /><br />PIGALLE - a boring sequence between Ardant and Hoskins, who are looking for new thrills in their relationship... very unfunny and unromantic, Pigalle is a let-down.<br /><br />QUARTIER DE LA MADELEINE - bringing some diversity in the movie, QdlM is a relief. A young guy (Wood) finds a vampire killing a victim... The tourist and the vampire... fall in love! Dark, scary and oddly romantic, Madeleine is superb.<br /><br />PERE-LACHAISE - another let-down segment. Directed by Wes Craven and with stars as Mortimer and Sewell, it could have been great, but Père-Lachaise is just ordinary, not original at all.<br /><br />FAUBOURG SAINT-DENIS - the rumors are TRUE, Twyker's short film is beautiful, stunning and well done. A blind man picks up the phone, and hears from his girlfriend (Portman - truly stunning) that she breaks up with him. He reflects on their relationship.<br /><br />QUARTIER Latin - even though this segment has been co-directed by Depardieu and has such stars as Rowlands, Gazzara and Depardieu, this segment is a let-down too. Nothing happens, lack of chemistry between the actors.<br /><br />14TH ARRONDISSEMENT - the last sequence is hilarious and sad at the same time. An American tells in her French class about her trip to Paris. Her French is truly terrible, but at the end of the segment, she realizes that Paris is so much more than meets the eye.<br /><br />With Feist on the background, ""Paris, je t'aime"" ends in a sweet tone, not letting me down at all, even though some segments bored the hell out of me, the entity of the movie is great! A true cinematic experience for young and old. Paris, je t'aime vraiment!",positive

The first 75% was pretty lackluster and I'm pretty sure it's because the main character may have been out of her depth, but it was not too bad once it got towards the end and she adapted into her full powers. The music scoring was not great, when she finally got her full powers they played 'Girl by Gwen Stefani' and it just did not have the right punch/impact. It did not get you hyped when she was supposed to be beating up the bad guys. Definitely not my favorite, but I finally found out how Fury lost his eye!",controversial

"This is one of the best crime-drama movies during the late 1990s. It was filled with a great cast, a powerful storyline, and many of the players involved gave great performances. Pacino was great; he should have been nominated for something. John Cusack was good too, as long as the viewer doesn't mind his Louuu-siana accent. He may come off as annoying if you can't stand this dialect. The way that Pacino's character interacted with Cusack's character was believable, dramatic, and slightly comical at times. Danny Aiello was superb as always. David Paymer was great in a supporting role. Bridget Fonda was good but not memorable. There were times when this picture mentioned so many characters, probably too many. It may take a second viewing to remember, ""which Zapatti was which?"" After so many cross-references, one has to stop and think just to recap. The ending didn't have a lot of sting. It was built up for so long and then was a bit of a letdown. This was one of the few problems with the film. Since the movie wasn't billed as a ""huge, blockbuster"" big screen hit, it made some forget that this movie even existed. Pacino and Aiello were great but the film's lack of ""splash"" in the theaters may have accounted for no nominations. It was semi-successful in the home market, and viewers are still learning that this title is out there. Made in 1996, it still stands up today and will remain popular for many years to come.<br /><br />So, make yourself some lemon pudding (you'll see) and see this movie!",positive

"The only problems the movie had was its plot, the main character and how everything flowed together.nCarol sucks, bad role model, bad at being a person. Her entire character just seems to boil down to 'strong woman' #5922. Which is to say, bland, uninteresting, yet always successful and unstoppable. She has no depth. Shes meant o be smart, funny, strong, skilled, etc...but we don't see that. She has full control of her powers, despite them only being suppressed and used as shooty beams..but she can fly, somehow breath, make herself invulnerable just because at the end...no struggle, no training, just done. She makes Superman look interesting.nThe Plot is dumb. If kree just killed her, they win, end. Hell, if she just died in the explosion...which is what logically would happen when you hit a huge mass of energy with a fucking energy weapon, no, she just gets super powers, no scars, burns or repercussions, just knocked out.nThe only one who helps make this not be bottom of the barrel garbage is Sam J, man can act.

"I normally don't leave ratings at Rotten Tomatoes, but I am angry at all these losers carpet bombing this web site with bad reviews because they are personally offended at the idea of a superheroine. I can't stand by in silence, so I am giving my two cents worth.nnThis is a good movie. I don't think it's as great as ""The Dark Knight"" (which I consider to be the greatest film of the first decade of the 21st century.) I also think it's slightly less than ""Alita"". But I was never bored and the action sequences were as good as any superhero movie I've seen in the past ten years. nnBrie Larson's Captain Marvel is a heroine I could root for. In the action scenes, I could readily see her as Marvel's premier superheroine (although I will always be partial to She-Hulk). But there were other scenes where Larson seems a little lost. If there is a difference between CM and Alita which made me favor the other slightly, it was the acting of the principle female leads. Even behind motion capture and CGI, Rosie Salazar acted her butt off. Larson was good enough, though.nnGetting back to the movie, Marvel wasn't just trying to make a superhero film, but also try to inspire a generation of young girls. There's a montage late in the film which shows Carol Danvers at various ages in her life getting back up after failing and hearing others say that she can't succeed. I can sympathize with this message even though I am a guy. But if your first instinct is ""This movie isn't for me"" then, well, maybe this movie isn't for you. You probably wouldn't like any of the original ""Ms. Marvel"" comic books either.",positive

"The movie was a huge disappointment for an entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe this far late in the game. It makes many missteps and unforced errors for something that isn't trying anything new. If Guardians of the Galaxy hate landed this flat on it's face you could at least have argued that they were trying something different and new. But Captain Marvel breaks no new ground, and ironically attempts to change the foundations of the MCU. The acting is overall good, with stand outs Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Mendelssohn. But the script and direction are what truly brings this film down. One of the most forgettable MCU   films in their canon.",negative

""We are European. We are cultured and sex-mad."" ""It is nice when we all screw each other."" Lots to talk about! Well, there kind of is in fact, relative to your average 60s topless volleyball number anyway. And the enervating patina of 'class' at least delivers clean, detailed compositions. But what the hell kind of thing is that to say about a porn? OK then: the only scene I really (rhetorically) got off on was the first time Brigitte Maier steps in. There are efforts to toss in a nice variety of race and age while letting no two men anywhere near each other; the one black guy suffers a premature bout of editorial coitus interruptus.

Like the pacing of this movie sucked so bad, and we don't really have any gravity of Carols situation. I often find myself asking ""why should we care?"" And the ending ""plot twist"" was actually very predictable. The acting in the movie was fine, Sam Jackson played a great part, Ben Mendelsohn same. The rest were just meh. Story was weak, weird, and paced terribly. Special effects were atrocious to look at, it looked like an actual 90's movie. The editing, dear God almighty the editing was so bad, like actually so bad. Look at HiTop films to explain why, i just cant do it justice. It was actually so bad i had to close my eyes because the cringe was so bad. And when she was fighting in the end to the tune of ""im just a girl"" this attempted James Gunn impression with the retro song fight fell hard on its face, it was juat terrible.

For example, the scenes with the Oriental antiques dealer were very reminiscent of many scenarios I remember from the books.

"A warning to potential viewers: if you are looking for an adaptation of the classic story ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" look elsewhere. ""Seven Women for Satan""<br /><br />only superficially addresses the original work by using the name of Zaroff and having said character murder people.<br /><br />Some of what follows might be considered by some to be spoilers. Or not.<br /><br />Boris Zaroff is played by writer/director Michel Lemoine. Whereas his ancestor hunted men because they were the only prey that were truly challenging, Boris' victims are usually in a position where they cannot defend themselves. The film rambles from scene to scene with a near-total lack of clarity. The director seems to have totally disregarded pacing and left the viewer with a suffocatingly dull film. A few individual scenes are mildly interesting (such as a torture rack sequence), but as a unit, the film fails to entertain. Viewers who are more<br /><br />interested in an assortment of attractive and semi-attractive actresses in various stages of undress might find the film watchable. Most will probably find their time is better spent watching Mentos commercials.<br /><br />In a side note, the DVD extras included a fair amount of information on the film's history.

"ANTWONE FISHER is the story of a young emotionally troubled U.S. Navy seaman. His problems lead him to Jerome Davenport, a psychiatrist who helps him realize that his troubles stem from his childhood upbringing. <br /><br />Get ready to shed a tear or two. The movie could thaw the coldest heart. I loved the story, which turns from something so very awful to happen to anyone into a positive ending. ANTWONE FISHER is a powerful movie, most importantly about forgiveness. Other important issues that get you thinking are child abuse, adoption, and foster care.<br /><br />Oscar winner, Denzel Washington does an impressive job in his directorial debut. There were many scenes which I enjoyed watching. They included the beginning (dreams of a little boy  check out the gigantic-sized pancakes!) and the ending (dreams turned into reality), which beautifully tied the story together. <br /><br />Another wonderful scene occurred when the doctor encouraged Antwone to search for his family to find answers to his questions about his family that abandoned him. <br /><br />My favorite scene happened when the young man finally confronted his mother and her reaction towards him. Priceless.<br /><br />All the actors represented their parts well. <br /><br />In addition to directorial responsibilities, Mr. Washington continues to show why he won an Oscar award and is successful in all his acting roles. He had a strong presence in this movie.<br /><br />Actor, Derek Luke demonstrated why he was so right for the part of Antwone Fisher. He portrayed very real and heart-tugging work.<br /><br />Joy Bryant who played the part of Cheryl, Antwone's love interest, resembled a ray of sunshine on the screen. The chemistry flowed well between the romantic characters.<br /><br />Novella Nelson who played the part of Mrs. Tate, a despicable character, deserves special mention.<br /><br />Although we only see her for a few minutes, the actress who played Fisher's mother gave an outstanding performance.<br /><br />Everyone should see ANTWONE FISHER.",positive

"Like the gentle giants that make up the latter half of this film's title, Michael Oblowitz's latest production has grace, but it's also slow and ponderous. The producer's last outing, ""Mosquitoman-3D"" had the same problem. It's hard to imagine a boring shark movie, but they somehow managed it. The only draw for Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy was it's passable animatronix, which is always fun when dealing with wondrous worlds beneath the ocean's surface. But even that was only passable. Poor focus in some scenes made the production seems amateurish. With Dolphins and Whales, the technology is all but wasted. Cloudy scenes and too many close-ups of the film's giant subjects do nothing to take advantage of IMAX's stunning 3D capabilities. There are far too few scenes of any depth or variety. Close-ups of these awesome creatures just look flat and there is often only one creature in the cameras field, so there is no contrast of depth. Michael Oblowitz is trying to follow in his father's footsteps, but when you've got Shark-Week on cable, his introspective and dull treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment.",positive

"Such an awesome backstory for Nick Fury! So happy to see him get more screen time. Brie Larson was great in this role.

"How do these guys keep going? They're about 50 years old each, and act as if they're only 30. They play 3 hours of music at every concert, and barely break a sweat. This DVD is their first concert in Rio, Brazil. Although the people don't speak English, they try to memorize the words to the most famous Rush songs, and try to sing a foreign language at the concert with their best friends.<br /><br />From Tom Sawyer to The Spirit of Radio, this concert DVD will keep you in the chair not wanting to pause or move away from the classics that you've listened to when you were young. This is their 30th reunion tour (started in 1974). I went to their Scranton PA concert, and this was just as good, although in PA they didn't play Freewill, so I was upset.<br /><br />They have Freewill, they have The Trees, they have YYZ, The Pass, Driven, Dreamline, Red Sector A, Limelight, Roll the Bones, 2112, and much more. 10 out of 10, because nothing else compares.

I won’t drone on and on about it but I will say that I am so happy that the movie didn’t play it as safe as ‘The Force Awakens’ did (and that’s not to knock TFA, I really enjoyed that movie) but it did regurgitate a lot from ‘A New Hope’. In this one, we get a lot of creative twist and turns, engaging story arcs, some genuine surprises and an abundance of thrilling action sequences.",positive
"A plane carrying employees of a large biotech firm--including the CEO's daughter--goes down in thick forest in the Pacific Northwest. When the search and rescue mission is called off, the CEO, Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen), puts together a small ragtag group to execute their own search and rescue mission. But just what is Knowles searching for and trying to rescue, and just what is following and watching them in the woods? <br /><br />Oy, what a mess this film was! It was a shame, because for one, it stars Lance Henriksen, who is one of my favorite modern genre actors, and two, it could have easily been a decent film. It suffers from two major flaws, and they're probably both writer/director Jonas Quastel's fault--this film (which I'll be calling by its aka of Sasquatch) has just about the worst editing I've ever seen next to Alone in the Dark (2005), and Quastel's constant advice for the cast appears to have been, ""Okay, let's try that again, but this time I want everyone to talk on top of each other, improvise non-sequiturs and generally try to be as annoying as possible"".<br /><br />The potential was there. Despite the rip-off aspects (any material related to the plane crash was obviously trying to crib The Blair Witch Project (1999) and any material related to the titular monster was cribbing Predator (1987)), Ed Wood-like exposition and ridiculous dialogue, the plot had promise and potential for subtler and far less saccharine subtexts. The monster costume, once we actually get to see it, was more than sufficient for my tastes. The mixture of character types trudging through the woods could have been great if Quastel and fellow writer Chris Lanning would have turned down the stereotype notch from 11 to at least 5 and spent more time exploring their relationships. The monster's ""lair"" had some nice production design, specifically the corpse decorations ala a more primitive Jeepers Creepers (2001). If it had been edited well, there were some scenes with decent dialogue that could have easily been effective.<br /><br />But the most frightening thing about Sasquatch is the number of missteps made: For some reason, Quastel thinks it's a good idea to chop up dialogue scenes that occur within minutes of each other in real time so that instead we see a few lines of scene A, then a few lines of scene B, then back to A, back to B, and so on.<br /><br />For some reason, he thinks it's a good idea to use frequently use black screens in between snippets of dialogue, whether we need the idea of an unspecified amount of time passing between irrelevant comments or whether the irrelevant comments seem to be occurring one after the other in time anyway.<br /><br />For some reason, he doesn't care whether scenes were shot during the morning, afternoon, middle of the night, etc. He just cuts to them at random. For that matter, the scenes we're shown appear to be selected at random. Important events either never or barely appear, and we're stuck with far too many pointless scenes.<br /><br />For some reason, he left a scene about cave art in the film when it either needs more exposition to justify getting there, or it needs to just be cut out, because it's not that important (the monster's intelligence and ""humanity"" could have easily been shown in another way).<br /><br />For some reason, there is a whole character--Mary Mancini--left in the script even though she's superfluous.<br /><br />For some reason we suddenly go to a extremely soft-core porno scene, even though the motif is never repeated again.<br /><br />For some reason, characters keep calling Harlan Knowles ""Mr. H"", like they're stereotypes of Asian domestics.<br /><br />For some reason, Quastel insists on using the ""Blurry Cam"" and ""Distorto-Cam"" for the monster attack scenes, even though the costume doesn't look that bad, and it would have been much more effective to put in some fog, a subtle filter, or anything else other than bad cinematography.<br /><br />I could go on, but you get the idea.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this film better than I didI'm a Henriksen fan, I'm intrigued by the subject, I loved the setting, I love hiking and this is basically a hiking film on one level--but I just couldn't. Every time I thought it was ""going to be better from this point until the end"", Quastel made some other awful move. In the end, my score was a 3 out of 10.",negative

There hasn't been an introduction film for a hero since black panther and ant man. But those characters were introduced before they had there own films. That being said. Captain marvel comes late in the game with no mention of her character in previous films nor does she make any appearances. BUT this movie comes out pretty strong without an establishment of her character in any before films. I enjoyed it and it felt like a fresh introduction to phase 4 and new heroes to come. I really enjoyed this film it was a fun and heart felt ride. I highly recommend this film for a fun watch.,positive
"I hate guns and have never murdered anyone, but when even half of the events that take place in 'Shuttle' happen to you or close ones and you find a gun, YOU SHOOT YOUR ATTACKER. THREE TIMES. FIVE TIMES. Whatever makes the pulse stop on them and increase on you. I think even God would say, ""Good call."" In a very 'Hostel'-type film, but more realistic  as this really could happen to anyone, well, if you're a pretty young woman, that is  'Shuttle' was a decent film, though on the long side. A few good shocks (always call AAA even just to change a tire), basically just one surprise but for the most part, you could see things coming. And aside from the typical ""tie him up"" instead of the previously mentioned shooting him, the most annoying part was the revelation towards the closing from one best friend to the other. Getting past those, it's enjoyable for what it is. Basically, we have two unsuspecting females traveling alone from Mexico home (wow, that's original) and one lost her luggage preventing them from leaving the airport until late. And after an obvious foreshadowed sign-language scene, they enter a ""too-good-to-be-true"" half-price shuttle ride. Clichéd jocks, previously introduced, con their way on the shuttle, to join what appears to be Alan Ruck's stunt double from 'Speed.' From here, it's obvious what happens (I did mention it was a 'Hostel' knock off) but still, I didn't find too much horrible, yet nothing spectacular. Though, it would've served the audience better with roughly 15-20 minutes deleted, I would recommend if you have almost 2 hours to kill and are into sick horror.",negative
"This movie was amazing. I don't understand everyone is hating on it. It was an empowering, amazing, all around exciting movie with a message that can really help young girls. I don't believe that they ""compromised her femininity"" but yet represented the women who are not as feminine as society imagines they should be. Just because a female character doesn't fit your standard of how feminine the said character should be, doesn't mean that they are not an accurate representation of women. Also, to everyone saying that no one actually goes through the oppression that she went through as a child and her adult life. You're wrong. As a woman, I have went through that pretty much since I was 7. People told me I couldn't play baseball or basketball even though I was good at both. Anyway, I feel like the people that don't like the feminist tones of this movie are just not used to seeing a beloved female character who doesn't have on some sort of sexy outfit, or ""isn't feminine enough"" That's all. It was a great movie.",controversial

Below are some highlights (potential spoilers):nn* I believe Nick Fury has more screen time in this movie than all previous movies combined, and I found it very interesting to learn more about his backstory.  And how he lost his eye.nn* I found it poignant, and almost sad, seeing Agent Coulson again. I found myself looking at the young agent, who was had no idea yet on what a large part he'd have to play in the future of S.H.I.E.L.D., the Avengers, and the future of the world. I wanted to warn him about Loki, but alas, I was helpless.nn* The history of Earth's tesseract is further explained, which I found kind of interesting.nn* I found it super interesting to learn that initially, Nick Fury's pet project was going to be named the ""Protector Initiative"", but at the last moment, renamed it the ""Avenger Initiative"".  Although Captain America is often named as the first avenger, I found it super cool to learn that the entire initiative was inspired by Captain Marvel's Air Force call sign.  She literally IS ""Avenger"".nn* We learn where Nick Fury got his pager, and who he paged at the end of Infinity War (stick around for the credits.)nnThings that weren't so great:nn* It started off a little slow.nn* It's not super clear to me why the Infinity War emergency warranted Nick Fury paging Captain Marvel, but not any of the previous Earth-shattering disasters.nn* Captain Marvel is a way over-powered ""I win"" button.  If you compare her powers to Hawkeye or even Spiderman, they're not even in the same league.nnAgain, overall, I liked the flick, and would watch it again.",positive
"I am right now in front of the tv, watching Casomai. It is changing, it id evolving or better...devolving. It begin with a courius wedding of the two protagonists where their love-story is reported. After that everything change, a child was born, and all the rest usually happen in a couple. It is a not a special movie because it talks about a normal couple, and normality is the center of this movie. It doesn't want to show us something particular, there is nothing new, it is just a normal love-story, the story of a couple, and being normal it become different from the rest. It is also a flashing movie, everything is short, every scene is long just some seconds. It is a reported story, many things are known because friends and parents talk about that, and their opinion is central, the opinions create the story and destroy it. It is a simple story of a couple as I said, but it is not boring, it just show a couple, should be everything known, it is, but I am sure that every one of you will want to know what happen, so don't forget to watch the end!",positive

I was touched by the characters, laughed a lot at the wonderful script, and was deeply moved by the genuine emotions magnificently portrayed by this ensemble cast and especially by Peter Falk. In fact, one of his scenes in the kitchen of his apartment with his children where he tells of his experience of his life, his deep love for his wife and his decisions about his life going forward is so profoundly real that it is at the highest level of the best Academy Award-winning performances. He is a consummate actor who out-did himself in this film.

It's a bird! It's a plane! It's MARVEL'S WONDER WOMAN.. ergh, attempt; with a wholly-unoriginal hero thefting Supergirl's look/motif/alter-ego (Kara Danvers -> Carol Danvers), Shazam's name (original Captain Marvel), and Green Lantern's pilot-turned-spacecop backstory (& even green suit/Corps). nThere's a reason Captain Marvel has been shunned in comics for decades having to be rebooted 6 (yes, SIX) times and still failing to fly off the shelves alongside Marvel's otherwise strong female characters: Jean Grey, Elektra, She-Hulk, Scarlet Witch, Black Widow (10 years w/o a solo movie from MCU (yikes).. Ant-Man & Groot got 2..), etc. Beyond its questionable hero choice to start, the film is riddled with ultra-politicized false-feminist eye-rollers forced throughout its brutally weak origin-cliched script, no real villain or plot direction, and a (horrific) controversial casting who has the emotive display range of a wet rock! nnBrie Larson might literally be the worst casting in superhero *history*, a truly mind-boggling pick from her arrogant, pompous, and thoroughly-unlikeable personality to her controversial, simply-inane past comments (look up: saying white guys shouldn't be allowed to watch/review movies, guys daring to talk to a girl warrant 'defense from'?, and my favorite: self-proclaiming the CM trailer was going to ""break the internet""? (spoiler: it didn't. Did halve its box office projections though!). She is positively somnambulistic sleep-walking through the entire film, without even a sign of human emotion or life for most of the scenes she's in and dooming the film from the start.The plot, politics, and hero are problematic as well. What everyone feared going in: the false-feminist pandering/politics are strong with this one. There are so many unbearably eye-rolling liners force-fed to us throughout this ride from constant superiority-complexing and demonizing guys with laughably-ridiculous lines like ""only guys can be pilots.. that's why they call it a C*CK-pit""..... to portraying them as creepers, fools, or overly-aggressive.. I cannot fathom why Marvel thought this was a good idea. People go to the cinema for escapism, not to be lectured on politics. nnThere's a reason Wonder Woman, The Force Awakens, Alien(/s), Terminator, and many other female-led blockbusters got absolutely *none* of the hate Captain Marvel is - they portrayed strong women and empowering narratives without *once* getting political/preachy/ condescending/superiority-complexed. But here, everything is distorted and twisted unnaturally to show how great and flawless Brie is and how not men are. The film is deprived of even basic plot conventions in order to continually uplift her without the possibility of daring to challenge. CM isn't even allowed to have a true VILLAIN or final fight because of this, turning the Skrulls from an iconic Marvel villain powerful in the comics to unintimidating and victimized by film's end being even scared of cats (which was a shameless pander overdone to appease mass audiences and hopefully hide/make them forget their flaws like Marvel usually does with humor). nnAlthough Captain Marvel has a few moments like its 90's soundtrack, fine galactic CGI/Skrull-action, Sam L. Jackson, and self-discovery thread/powers, its muddled in an otherwise *unbearable* outer shell. A breathtakingly-unoriginal hero extremely unpopular in comics stealing everything from Shazam's name to Supergirl's look/alter-ego to basically everything about Green Lantern's pilot-turned-spacecop backstory and Corps IP is given a brutally-weak film with ultra-politicized plotting riddled with eye-rolling one-liners, condescending cat-pandering, a contrived generic narrative with no real villainous or strong opposing presence to purposely coddle/uplift its hero, & an absolute trainwreck of casting in Brie Larson being *thoroughly* unlikeable in every way and sleep-walking through the entire film.

Maybe she is,but she's not the only hero  actually, it's hard to classify her as a hero. Why does she do what she does? Where does she get her motivations from? Last point: The way she handled Nick Fury made me beside myself. YOU WIN NO FANS with this movie. she's too stuck up and full of herself.  The character seems very insecure and shallow.",controversial
"Bland and boring. Should have been better. Brie Larson is either horribly miscast or been given bad direction. The writing is quite bad too. There's no excuse for this flop. I would rate it just above Thor - The dark world. In this day and age when marvel churns classics like IW , GOTG1 , Ragnarok and Winter Soldier this movie has no place. Wonder Woman was so much better minus the last bit.",negative

"Preposterous sequel stretches credibility to a great degree as diabolical sociopath Stanley Kaldwell returns this time infiltrating the movie production of the novel he wrote for the garden drownings, assuming the identity of a second unit director he murdered.<br /><br />Film pokes gleeful fun at Hollywood, with a tongue-in-cheek script taking shots at tyrannical directors who sleep with their actresses(..looking for a way up the ladder)and dislike anyone challenging them for complete spotlight. Brian Krause, who I thought was dreadful, overacting to the point where the satire felt incredibly forced, portrays the loud, temperamental director who doesn't like the fact that his second unit director and screenplay writer, Alison(..played by Dahlia Salem)seem to be taking over the production. Andrew Moxham is Paul Parsons, who is the brother of a victim from the first film. The film's dark humor this time takes the idea of a serial killer actually operating as director of a movie set and exploits it for all it's worth. Nelson again ably slides back into his psycho role without any difficulty, with Stanley as clever as ever, using his brains to commandeer a film production, killing whoever he has to in order to maintain full control of his work, letting no one stand in his way..that is until Alison realizes who Stanley really is. Alison is the type of ambitious writer who wants to capture the essence of her subject..what motivated Stanley to kill, why would he do such a thing, and what led such a man down this dark path? The humor of Alison actually working with that very man is also part of the satire at the heart of this dark comedy thriller. Of course, you get the inevitable showdown between Alison and Stanley, with a really ridiculous, unbelievable conclusion regarding the killer's fate(..quite a hard pill to swallow). Unlike the first film, which was photographed with sophisticated polish, director Po-Chih Leong uses unnecessary techniques which are not needed(..such as shooting an all kinds of weird angles, slow-motion in a sepia color, and several instances which are captured on video)and rather annoy instead of impress. This sequel, to me, just wasn't on target as much as the original, with a lot of the humor less effective and more obvious.",negative

He said the same thing of Thor, but that wasnt mentioned, they treated her as the 1st Avenger???? Cant tell me Fury hadnt heard of Capt America,  and Iron man was know in the 80s, , the timeline isnt correct,  or doesnt seem to be.

"Film version of Sandra Bernhard's one-woman off-Broadway show is gaspingly pretentious. Sandra spoofs lounge acts and superstars, but her sense of irony is only fitfully interesting, and fitfully funny. Her fans will say she's scathingly honest, and that may be true. But she's also shrill, with an unapologetic, in-your-face bravado that isn't well-suited to a film in this genre. She doesn't want to make nice--and she's certainly not out to make friends--and that's always going to rub a lot of people the wrong way. But even if you meet her halfway, her material here is seriously lacking. Filmmaker Nicolas Roeg served as executive producer and, though not directed by him, the film does have his chilly, detached signature style all over it. Bernhard co-wrote the show with director John Boskovich; their oddest touch was in having all of Sandra's in-house audiences looking completely bored--a feeling many real viewers will most likely share. *1/2 from ****",negative

"The famous international conductor Daniel Daréus (Michael Nyqvist) has a heart attack with his stressed busy professional life and interrupts his successful career with an early retirement. He decides to return to his hometown in the north of Sweden, from where his mother left when he was a seven year-old sensitive boy bullied by Conny and other school mates, to live a low-paced life. He buys an old school and is invited to participate in the church choir by the local Shepherd Stig (Niklas Falk), but the reluctant and shy Daniel refuses in the principle. However, he gets involved with the community and feels attracted by Lena (Frida Hallgren), a local woman with a past with the local doctor. His music opens the hearts of the members of the choir, affecting their daily life: the slow Tore (André Sjöberg) has the chance to participate in the choir; Inger (Ingela Olsson), the wife of Stig, releases her repressed sexuality; Gabriella (Helen Sjöholm) takes an attitude against her abusive and violent husband; the gossiper and frustrated Siv (Ilva Lööf) opens her heart against Lena; the fat Holmfrid (Mikael Rahm) cries enough against the jokes of the businessman Arne (Lennart Jähkel); even Daniel starts loving people and Lena as the love of his life. When they are invited to participate in an important contest in Vienna, Daniel finds his music opening the heart of people making his dream come true.<br /><br />""Så Som I Himmelen"" is a touching and sensitive movie, with a very beautiful story. It is impressive how director Kay Pollak and the screenplay writers have been able to develop a great number of characters in 132 minutes running time. The performances are top-notch, supported by magnificent music score and at least two awesome moments: when Gabrielle sings her song in the concert, and certainly the last concert in Vienna with the audience, jury and everybody participating in the melody, and Daniel making his dream come true. Like in ""Teorema"", the stranger changes the lives, not of only a family, but of a conservative community. Further, like many European movies, the open conclusion indicates that Daniel actually died, at least in my interpretation, reaching peace with the success of his music. My eyes became wet in these two scenes. My vote is nine.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): ""A Vida no Paraíso"" (""The Life In the Paradise"")",positive
"This has to be, hands down, hats off, one of the most uproarious comedies ever made. Starting with the animated blowing, popping bubbles, the entrance to the Daytime Awards, the usual phony drivel spewed by the stars on the red carpet, the rehearsed and badly acted acceptance speech, the venomous comments uttered by the actor's jealous co-stars and producer, under phony smiles. Now THAT is only in the first few minutes. Then, all hell breaks loose from there and it only gets more frantic and ridiculous. Ridiculous in a good way, no, make that a great way. This was the first time I'd seen the always charming Teri Hatcher. While I may not be a follower of Desperate Housewives, she herself is always watchable - same goes for Lois & Clark. Not a huge follower, but if I run across an episode I'd watch it. Robert Downey, jr., does a great turn as slimy, smarmy, snaky, sycophantic David Seaton Barnes, the producer who'd give his right eye to see Sally Field's Celeste Talbert leave the show, if only to finally get to get it on with Cathy Moriarty's Montana Moorehead.<br /><br />Moriarty absolutely shines in this movie, just as she had everywhere else she's appeared. Here, all she has to do is scream ""I HATE YOU I HATE YOU YOU CREEP!"" or give one of her anti-Celeste-co-conspirators an evil grin, and she has me rolling in the aisles. Yes, Cathy Moriarty is a very gifted actress, and one hell of a comedienne. Sally Field gratefully departs from the usual 70-MM-sized Lifetime Tragedy of the Week movies, and we're all reminded why she is who she is today, having started off in comedy afraid of nothing. Her ensuing years of drama had hidden her sense of humor, but like a caterpillar in a cocoon, the brilliant comedienne she is had blossomed and it was joyous to see her as hilarious as she was. The thing with dramatic actors and actresses is that you see in such heavy, serious roles, that you associate them with their character and you can't believe it when you see them finally having some fun on screen.<br /><br />How lucky were the producers to land Carrie Fisher, if only for a glorified cameo. She doesn't realize what a presence she bears on screen. She takes a role which, in the hands of a lesser actress, could easily have been forgotten, but she owns the character and it seems as if she wrote it herself.<br /><br />How lucky was Elisabeth Shue to get thrown in the middle of all this! At the time, she wasn't really known for much. Adventures in Babysitting was kind of cute (yes, I was dragged to an evening show for which I had to pay full price), but she didn't hold my attention - - much. But here, she makes the most of her character - star's niece who falls in love with the star's ex-co-star-and-lover who, of course, turns out to be the niece's father, and the star turns out to be the poor girl's mother.<br /><br />I'll stop there - I feel I practically wrote a book about this brilliant screwball comedy, or at least a novela. If you've seen it, then reminisce. If you haven't, you've missed a real classic, but not really. The DVD's are made of a material that'll last for at least 25 years, and this movie is timeless, so what the hell.",positive
"The Color Purple is about the struggles of life and the love that helps those people strongly affected by the struggles of life. Every character had an element of the color purple in them.

"""User Ratings: 27,891"" - I didn't feel interested enough to bother rating this mediocre movie earlier, but now I do after it became obvious Rotten Tomatoes started to delete & manipulate audience score.nnFirst of all, I've seen Captain Marvel here in Hungary days before official release. For me it was a disappointment, and going by the only 3 star rating and the single critical sentence of the movie near the end of the article of Peter Bradshaw (The Guardian) I believe it's the same for him. It is full of political agenda which as a Hungarian EU citizen doesn't matter to me at all, nor do I care for. Why do I feel like this movie had other goals than to just entertain the audience, especially with an US audience?nnCan't do but wonder why most of the 'top critics' articles seem to be praising an at best mediocre movie where only the 90s nostalgia is really good. It almost feels like a forced, desperate search by the critics (see Bradshaw's) for positive things in the movie to be able to fill up the whole article with.nnrating of movie: 4.5 out of 10nnThe loss of about half the user ratings and the attempt to 'fix' the audience score, which now doubled to stand at 52% as i write this is absurd and a horrid censorship.

"I went in to the movie with low expectations. There was some controversial comments by actress Brie Larson in the months leading up to the release of the film that contributed in my initial lack of interest. My curiously brought me out to the theatre anyway especially since Captain Marvel will seemingly play a big part in the upcoming Avengers: End Game movie. This movie was better than expected, but not an amazing Marvel film. It would not fare well on its own in the box office without the End Game hype that will draw diehard fans for that alone. Some specifics: Captain Marvel is a Mary Sue. Even without her full powers at the beginning she was able to defeat 20+ enemy Skrull's and quite easily. From there on it only became easier for our hero and there was really no build up or development of her powers. Even though she acquired her powers by absorbing energy from the light speed engine exploding, she should still need to train and practice using her powers before becoming so unstoppable. Also, not surprisingly, there was an underlying feminist theme in this movie. To Marvel's credit, it was more subtle than I expected and did not detract too much from the story. Lastly, I really did not like the choice to make Carol Danvers the reason why the Avengers got their name. From what I can tell in my searches that was never mentioned in the comics and was made up to give this character more importance. It's almost disrespectful to our favorite original Avengers before Captain Marvel came along that she was given the honor and so far unearned privilege of being the reason behind the entire name of this beloved franchise.

"When one of my friends recommended this to me, raving about how well it was filmed, the underlying themes and the general greatness of the film, I obviously expected an amazing, at least entertaining film.<br /><br />The two hours I spent watching this turned out to be a huge disappointing waste of my time.<br /><br />I understand that this movie is meant to be surreal, but even in surreal movies, there is something which anchors it down, even if it is only in the slightest. This movie, on the other hand, felt forced and fake. A lot of the shots were unnecessary and watching it made me think the director was trying to hard to be artistic.<br /><br />The acting was poor, and the relationships between characters were not nearly developed enough. Maybe that's just me missing something that others could see but I hadn't even realised there was any sort of attraction between Dae su and Migo before they started getting at it like rabbits randomly half way through the film. Then again, maybe this film was just bad.<br /><br />I am not against violence in movies, but in this one, almost all of it was just unnecessary. Throughout all the fight scenes I felt myself cringing at how painfully cliché it all was.<br /><br />And the plot? The word laughable comes to mind. I would be amused if I hadn't wasted two hours of my life following this poorly thought out and ridiculous plot. Despite all the movie's flaws, by the end of it, I was expecting something interesting to conclude it. I won't discuss the ending, because I wouldn't want to ""spoil"" the movie for those who haven't seen it. Just that the metaphor ""Be it a rock or a grain of sand, in water they sink as the same."" cannot be used as an explanation for everything.<br /><br />This entire movie was made for shock value and shock value only. I just hope sooner or later people will stop being so pretentious and recognise a bad movie for what it is. I've seen many other great Korean films and it depresses me that people have hailed Oldboy as the best.",negative
This was not a good movie. Marvel movies are always fun  and exciting. This movie was exciting in parts but not any fun. I can't remember any humor in this movie at all. Brie Larson was not the right actress for this role. She a good actress but should not have been cast for this movie.,positive

In ""Azumi"", the title character is the best of a group of superior killers. In ""Azumi 2"" she seems somehow diminished and less-impressive.<br /><br />That's not to say it was a total loss. There were a few decent fight scenes and some over-the-top characters. Unfortunately, the movie suffers overall from the simple fact that Shusuke Kaneko and Yoshiaki Kawajiri are not Ryuhei Kitamura and Isao Kiriyama.

There are many more things i am sure a guy like you seen in this movie that did not fit with the MCU so far, the truth is we are being forced this character just to have a woman in the lead, they should have just used Black widow or S Witch. we should not have politic or agendas of any kind in movies. we love the MCU the way it was so why change something that was so great now, because if it keeps on going like this then the MCU is going downhill.

"Captain Marvel, as a concept, should've knocked it out of the park. Introducing Carol Danvers, the Skrulls, and expanding on the Kree, this film should have set us up for a lot of great things, like a Secret Invasion story. It didn't.nnThe scenes with Carol Danvers and Nick Fury are some of the best in the entire MCU, so why is this only getting 3 stars? Everything else. Including a character (Maria) seemingly only to champion women painfully explicitly (even though it does implicitly do so much better throughout the film), changing the Skrulls to be the stereotypical oppressed people, the Supreme Intelligence to be a strange hive mind, and Mar-Vell to be a woman (I mean, why? It's not because they needed more strong female characters, Carol Danvers and Maria stereotypical-feminist Rambeau were already there). Playing such on the nose tracks as No Doubt's ""Just a girl"" (yes, we get it Marvel, the lead is female, that's fine, but can we stop jerking ourselves off and get down to the movie now?), and straight up ripping scenes from other films (inexplicably being one ""yippee"" from straight up lifting a space fight from The Phantom Menace), most unforgivably from Raiders of the Lost Ark, having the suddenly-much-weaker male villain challenging the suddenly-much-stronger female villain to a fight with no powers only to get blasted out of the way with an ""I don't need to prove anything to you"". The ""get knocked down, but I get up again"" trope is also painfully present.nnAnd can we talk about Carol's powers? So, her power is not given to her by the Kree, but it is given to her by the Kree according to the film. What? No. You can't flip-flop on a binary.nnAbout 80% of this film felt meticulously crafted to make it the best Marvel film to date, and then some idiot came in and smeared identity politics and continuity errors over the rest. Why does that not get it a 4 star (80% of the stars) then? Because it was so nearly perfect, and I want to like it so bad, but that 20% taints the 80% of the film that is great, making the overall product mediocre.",controversial

Also, do fighter pilots really use chauvinism to describe a cockpit? Come on. So the entire movie she was held back and once she goes full power, she immediately knows how to control all of her powers. Come on. This is a poorly written Mary Sue character.

Electronic Lincoln was hilarious and I really think this will be a good Dark Horse Talk Show.<br /><br />I was very happy with the way he handled it and gave Andy Richtor some good lines to work with. As you would have suspected it was a little shaky but for that kind of time slot it was very good.<br /><br />Overall if you are not someone on weed or even if you are and you don't have something more important to do than watch this great piece and have a fun time doing it.,positive

"I enjoyed myself. Don't listen to misogynistic boys. Captain Marvel was dope. While it was a bit slow at first, it was it a good introduction to the character. I believe the slow start was necessary to fill any information gaps needed in the cinematic universe before Endgame comes out. However, the final scenes of the movie made Captain Marvel a total bad-ass, hella strong super hero.",controversial
"The best thing and seemingly worst thing I can say about Captain Marvel is ""it's a Marvel movie"" it's fornulaic, like a recipe in a cookbook. nFirst off the film really doesn't seem like necesary viewing for infinity war/endgame. It basically feels like filler meant to establish a character with alot of padding in between.  So if that's what you're wondering there you go. nThe casting was alright though a bit underutilized. Only a couple of characters particularly stand out while the rest feel bland or wooden, or are simply not given enough screentime to be used well. The runors about the main character herself having only a few expressions do seemingly ring true here. The ""villains"" for most of the film were seemingly inconsistent as well. Going back and forth between shooting at the main character, beating her friend to a pulp in attempted murder, and threatening a child, to just being lovable goofballs all of a sudden. It felt like someone in the writers room had two ideas ahead of time and instead of devoting to one they changed their mind a few times through the process. nThe music choices at most times felt shoehorned in not fitting scenes very well, almost like they were just wanting to make a soundtrack of 90s nostalgia justbfor the sake of it. I get the feeling those record sales will be decently high though. nThe effects were good, at least on a base level. The cgi was well done, props and makeup were quite well conceived as well. They weren't really used to any great affect though, most of the cgi heavy scenes sortof feeling like ""visual noise"" for lack of a better phrase. nSome people were worried about the political tones of the film. While yes they are there and that may take away for some it will likely be enjoyable for others. I don't feel like it takes to heavily away from the film though it does make her motivations feel a bit more murky in my opinion. nThe action was only really alright in one or two scenes, for the most part it was pretty bland and boring. Alot of it was just ""pew pew lazers"" nAll in all it was a film that you can get enjoyment out of- especially if you love the Marvel formula- but it isn't anything spectacular really and honestly is gonna be pretty forgettable for most. It feels like MCU filler shoved in last second to establish a new character.",negative

"I generally like this movie a lot. The animation is supreme: meaning they took to trouble to animate the hair and fur on animals and people. And being an amateur at graphics and animation (self teaching myself through books. For those who are curious on the same matter, I use the program Gmax by Discreet. It is a high quality free program that can be downloaded from the internet) I see that the quality of animation shown here is of high standards.<br /><br />The plot of this movie is good. Though this movie lacks character development, this story is still understandable. Generally, I believe that this movie is primarily should be watched by people who are fans of the game as its plot closely follows the game. As for me, I do not play the games and therefore I don't have the wowing effect it probably does on fans of the game.<br /><br />For those who like the game, I suggest this movie to you, and if you haven't played the game, I would still recommend this movie to you.",positive
"Another Asian horror movie packed with intense, and creepy moments. Another Asian horror trademark is the complexity of the plot, which is here as well. MAJOR SPOILER WARNING!<br /><br />The movie starts pretty simple - two sisters go to live with their dad and stepmother after being put in a mental institution after their mother hanged herself. The sisters seem very hostile towards their mother - especially the elder one - and they seem to ignore their father. All goes smoothly until the mother locks the young sister in the wardrobe and the elder sister tells her father. Then it hits you, ""your sister has been dead for years now"" It turns out the older sister is still not recovered from the death of her mother and what we didn't know is that the wardrobe the mother was hanged in fell on the younger sister and killed her as well.As for the stepmother she is the alter ego of the older sister - revealed when the stepmother (actually the sister's alter ego) is sitting on a couch when the real stepmother walks in! I hope it has been made clearer for confused Asian horror fans out there.<br /><br />Finally - my favourite scene is the scene where the father invites friends over for dinner and one of the friends starts to choke which erupts into a panic attack.

Animation is very nice and although steamboat Willie has no dialog, the music is enough for it.<br /><br />IMHO if this bit doesn't deserve 10/10 then any cartoon doesn't not only because it's a true classic, but also because it's so full of joy and it's always fun to watch.",positive

Cary Grant -- still in the throes of cinematic infancy -- seemed as though he was forever looking to ""find himself"", while Herbert Marshall was probably never anything BUT Herbert Marshall from the day he was born, until the day he died.

"The arrival of White Men in Arctic Canada challenges the freedom of a fearless ESKIMO hunter.<br /><br />W. S. Van Dyke, MGM's peripatetic director, was responsible for this fascinating look at life in the Arctic among the Inuit. His production was on location filming from April 1932 until November 1933 (although some annoying rear projection effects show that some of the shooting took place back at the Studio). While considered a documentary at the time, we would likely term it a 'docudrama' as it is scripted with an intriguing plot & storyline.<br /><br />The film shows the daily life of the Eskimo, both Winter & Summer, and in fact starts in the warmer time of the year without any snow or ice in sight. The constant striving for food is depicted, and the viewer gets to watch the exciting hunts for walrus, polar bear, whale & caribou. The native language is used throughout, with the use of title cards; the only English is spoken by the fishermen & Mounties encountered by the Eskimo. In fact, it is the arrival of White Men, both good & bad, and the change they make on Eskimo society, which is a major element in the narrative.<br /><br />This Pre-Code film deals in a refreshingly frank manner with the Eskimo moral code, particularly with their practice of wife-sharing, which was an important and completely innocent part of their culture. In fact, the entire film can be appreciated as a valuable look at a way of life which was rapidly disappearing even in the early 1930's.<br /><br />None of the cast receives screen credit, which is a shame as there are some notable performances. Foremost among them is that of Ray Wise, playing the leading role of Mala the Eskimo. Wise (1906-1952) was an Alaskan Native of Inuit ancestry and is absolutely splendid and perfectly believable in what was a very demanding part. As handsome as any Hollywood star, he would continue acting, using the name of Ray Mala, in a sporadic film career, often in tiny unbilled roles.<br /><br />Lovely Japanese-Hawaiian actress Lotus Long plays Mala's loyal second wife; the names of the fine actresses playing his other two wives are now obscure. Director Woody Van Dyke steps in front of the cameras as a strict North West Mounted Police inspector. The two decent-hearted Mounties who must deliver Mala to Canadian justice are played by Joe Sawyer & Edgar Dearing, both longtime movie character actors. Danish author Peter Freuchen, upon whose books the film was based, has a short vivid role of an evil wooden-legged sea captain who unwisely rouses Mala's icy wrath.",positive

"Watching Captain Marvel is an overall enjoyable and entertaining experience. Whilst the beginning portion of the film is rather tiresome, it soon picks up its pace with the arrival of the title heroine on earth. nnThe introduction of Nick Fury acts as a harbinger for the rest of the film with the chemistry between Samuel L. Jackson and Brie Larson seemingly being the main reason I enjoyed this movie. Furthermore, characters such as Talos and Goose were of particular notice Ă˘"" with Goose especially making me and the rest of the audience laugh. In terms of Larson's portrayal of Carol Danvers itself, it definitely progresses throughout the movie and I can say that in the second half the character and her motivations become ever more relatable Ă˘"" something which admittedly was a surprise to me as I had been somewhat disconcerted by the promotional material of the film. nnIn terms of that promotional material, I really must admit that I hate it. The first two original trailers for the flick presented Larson's portrayal as one which was completely soulless and monotone Ă˘"" a portrayal which I believe to be unapparent in Captain Marvel's later scenes. On top of this, the trailers seemed to present a ham-fisted feminist message which would cause further downpour and online backlash when some of the lead actress' rather ignorant statements were revealed Ă˘"" seemingly conforming this to be the reality of the situation. It is however not. The core message of the film is one of courage in the face of adversity and consciousness towards the reality of those who may trust and the beliefs you may hold Ă˘"" being very general in terms of who it is directed at. nnIn conclusion, the film features a great cast who seem to be enjoying their experience making the movie and it does not reflect the substandard trailers after around a fifth of the way into the movie. Whilst definitely not perfect and paling in comparison to many of the MCU's masterpieces, it is never the less a good experience for people of all ages. nnTOP PROS: Sam L.

"A mixed bag and a solid C rating. Casual audiences will generally receive it favorably. Big fans of the MCU will be disappointed to downright offended. Fury, Coulson, the interchanges before the main Avenger's story arcs were overall pleasing despite creating some sizable plot holes. The Stan Lee tribute was touching. Ms. Larson's acting fell short seeming much more cardboard and stale than Henry Cavill's as Superman at times. Overall her character doesn't come off nowhere near as strong as ScarJo's Black Widow or Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch who by comparison are not as â€śpowerfulâ€ť characters. But unfortunately they failed where Black Panther succeeded. They wanted to do an empowering movie for women and girls but this movie has so many subtle, not so subtle, and frankly unnecessary divisive moments to downplay or demonize every face of white men (with the exception of Coulson) that is divides the audience. Marvel missed their formula in the MCU. For the really the first time for me short of Iron Man 3. It is disappointing and I hope they take a lesson from making sure they stay on task with understanding you can't be inclusive if you're being divisive. Nailed it in Black Panther, nailed it other strong female characters in the MCU. But ultimately they failed in the delivery their main hero and strongest Avenger was supposed to deliver. It can be redeemed. But the character is gonna need some rework going forward. đź‘ŽđźŹ»",negative

Although Carol Denvers seems to have potential in the start, it kinda goes downhill after that and she becomes the most bland character I've ever witnessed in a superhero movie. She doesn't seem to have any kind of relatable emotions or opinions, and comes off as more robotic than human, which makes her incredibly boring.nnThe plot is alright, I enjoyed the twist at the end and there were other characters I felt shone brighter than Captain Marvel herself, so I enjoyed watching them. The fight at the end was pretty epic, glowing Captain Marvel was really cool, but it felt more like eye candy without any substance, so when it was over I had kinda already forgotten about it.

"I had pleasure to watch the short film ""The Cure"", by first time director Ryan Jafri. What really impress me are the camera work and music.<br /><br />I think many young filmmakers (as I myself am one of them) would experience hard time with cinematography when just start making of an indie. We see the output are not exactly what we imaged or below our ambitions. But this film, directorial debut from a young director, handled very well on screen. The camera motion, color, lighting, compositing all contribute to the story and emotion of the film.<br /><br />And music, as a key element of film language, helps a great deal too.<br /><br />It's hard to portray a woman's heart, her desire, her fear, especially in a short. But still, I have to admit I am not a fan of v/o (narration), especially when the film is advanced by narration, instead of shots and cuts. My personal feeling to some of the narrative part is, my guess was the narrator tried a bit too hard. So the energy pushes audience back from the emotion of the film.<br /><br />Overall, it's a short film nicely done, I could see the input from a director. Way to go, Ryan!

"It's a bit easy. That's about it.<br /><br />The graphics are clean and realistic, except for the fact that some of the fences are 2d, but that's forgiveable. The rest of the graphics are cleaner than GoldenEye and many other N64 games. The sounds are magnificant.

"Don't waste your money, this isn't even worth a dollar rental when it comes out on DVD. There was Zero character development, terrible writing, and it wasn't put together very well at all. nn    The story starts out with Brie Larson waking up on a strange alien planet. I say Brie Larson because they don't make it clear who this character is. Granted she is supposed to have amnesia (amnesia plot lines need to die, seriously, lazy writing) Then she wakes up Jude Law, and they fight, because she can't sleep. OK, whatever. About 20 minutes in you realize ""I think they're all calling her VeersĂ˘Â¦ I guess that's her name."" I am going to skip ahead, because I realize I want to relive this crap movie as little as humanly possible.nn    She crashes on Earth, and runs into Nick Fury. There are some fun moments with the 2 of them. I think if they could have done a lot more of their team up. This was one of the better plot points. Who doesn't want to see more young spy Nick Fury?nn    They decided to tell this story out of order. Many movies have done this before, but it's tricky. Character Development typically happens in the beginning of a story. Once you know who a character is, you can sympathize with them, care for them, root for them, and worry when they're in peril. Now that that is established you can get to the action. When you start action first, who cares if someone gets shot? I found myself getting more interested when her story and background unfolded. Unfortunately it was too late and we were already an hour into the movie. This movie has many flaws, but if it were told chronologically it would be far better.nn    They put together a great cast, and that was about it. This was just a bad movie. There has been a lot of criticism on lack of humor. It isn't like there weren't jokes, there just weren't any good jokes. I can honestly think of 1 maybe 2 where I laughed out loud. And there were plenty more sprinkled throughout, but no one was laughing. The third act was really dark, not in tone but in lighting. This is supposed to be the climax, but I can't see anything because someone turned the lights out. There was a lot of what I call ""First Draft"" writing. Lines, ideas, and jokes that sound like anyone could think of. When your average theater goer can guess what the character is going to say next, that's first draft writing.nn    Overall, this movie felt lazy and rushed. And looking back this movie doesn't add anything new, it was a placeholder before Endgame, and it made momeny. You're not missing anything if you skip it. Just watch one of the trailers, and you're all caught up.",negative

"Alejandro (Alejandro Polanco), called Ale for short, works at an auto-body repair shop in what has come to be known as the Iron Triangle, a deteriorating twenty block stretch of auto junk yards and sleazy car repair dealers close to Shea Stadium in Queens, New York. Here customers do not question whether or not parts come from stolen cars or why they are able to receive such large discounts, they simply put down their cash and hope that everything is on the up and up. Sleazy outskirts like these are not highlighted in the tour guides but Iranian-American director Ramin Bahrani puts them on vivid display in Chop Shop, a powerful Indie film that received much affection last year at Cannes, Berlin, and Toronto. A follow up to his acclaimed ""Man Push Cart"", Bahrani spent one and a half years in the location that F. Scott Fitzgerald described as in the Great Gatsby as ""the valley of the ashes"".<br /><br />For all its depiction of bleakness, Chop Shop is not a work of social criticism but, like Hector Babenco's Pixote, a poignant character study in which a young boy's survival is bought at the price of his innocence. Shot on location at Willets Point in Queens, Bahrani makes you feel as if you are there, sweating in a hot and humid New York summer with all of its noise and chaos. The film's focus is on the charming, street-smart 12-year-old Ale who lives on the edge without any adult support or supervision other than his boss (Rob Sowulski), the real-life proprietor of the Iron Triangle garage. Polanco's performance is raw and slightly ragged yet he fully earned the standing ovation he received at the film's premiere at Cannes along with a hug from great Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami.<br /><br />Cramped into a tiny room above the garage together with his 16-year-old sister Isamar (Isamar Gonzales) who works dispensing food from a lunch wagon, Ale is like one of the interchangeable spare parts he deals with. While he has dreams of owning his own food-service van, in the city that never sleeps, he knows that the only thing that may make the ""top of the heap"" is another dented fender. In this environment, Ale and Isi use any means necessary to keep their heads above water while their love for each other remains constant and they still laugh and act out the childhood that was never theirs. As Barack Obama says in his book ""Dreams From My Father"", the change may come later when their eyes stop laughing and they have shut off something inside. In the meantime, Ale supplements his earnings by selling candy bars in the crowded New York subways with his friend Carlos (Carlos Zapata) and pushing bootleg DVDs on the street corners, while Isi does tricks for the truck drivers to save enough money to buy the rusted $4500 van in which they hope to start their own business.<br /><br />Though Ale is a ""good boy"", he is not above stealing purses and hubcaps in the Shea Stadium parking lot, events that Bahrani's camera observes without judgment. In Chop Shop, Bahrani has provided a compelling antidote to the underdog success stories churned out by the Hollywood dream factory, and has given us a film of stunning naturalism and respect for its characters, similar in many ways to the great Italian neo-realist films and the recent Iranian works of Kiarostami, Panahi, and others. While the outcome of the characters is far from certain, Bahrani makes sure that we notice a giant billboard at Shea Stadium that reads, ""Make dreams happen"", leaving us with the hint that, in Rumi's phrase, ""the drum of the realization of that promise is beating,""",positive
"This one will get reviews all over the map because it doesn't comfortably fit any mold. It's horror-- but not a splatterfest. It's equal part Suspense as well as Horror-- yet without the usual Hollywood screams and jerky camera. <br /><br />The feel of the movie is spare and lean with next to no special effects because I think you should listen and watch the faces of the characters.<br /><br />Forget that Brendan is a graduate of the Buffy universe. That's a red herring. He IS acting here. 'Camp' is a misreading of the tone of this story. Adrienne Barbeau is giving a rock solid performance-- so she must believe the script has something to say. We all know the sorry excuses where the actors plainly don't care anymore and are just waiting for the director to snap ""Cut"" and get their paychecks. This is Not the case, here.<br /><br />Forgive the fact that the bodies begin to fall with almost mondo-funny regularity. I don't think the intent was humorous-- but to keep you off balance. <br /><br />Think of it less of a Horror 'Movie' and more of a Horror 'Play' on a stage-- that decrepit whitewashed house. Then you might see it's really about paranoia, fear, and spiralling madness set in an isolated someplace, USA.<br /><br />And it is twisty. Time travel, Mind Control, secret experiments and Nazi's who may NOT be dead. . .yet.<br /><br />I say rent it and give it a try if you're in the mood for something a little cerebral. This would be a good choice for a Saturday Midnight sit down.",positive

Great movie. Fuck the trolls,controversial
"Excellent film that not only integrates beautifully into the standard and cosmic elements of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but brings them together. It not only serves as a great origin tale for Captain Marvel but as a terrific vehicle for Fury, showing his early days of being in SHIELD (with Coulson as well) and answering any number of unanswered questions on the MCU. We also get to see a few other familiar faces (Korath and Ronan the Accuser) and more than a couple of plot twists and surprises. Brie Larson is a great choice for the character, there's action and drama (and trademark humor) and it's really a must see for any Marvel fan. Shame on the misogynistic trolls who hate on this film just because they can. Shut up and actually WATCH it. It's GOOD. You might find you were sorely mistaken.",controversial
"Emilio Miraglia's first Giallo feature, The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave, was a great combination of Giallo and Gothic horror - and this second film is even better! We've got more of the Giallo side of the equation this time around, although Miraglia doesn't lose the Gothic horror stylings that made the earlier film such a delight. Miraglia puts more emphasis on the finer details of the plot this time around, and as a result it's the typical Giallo labyrinth, with characters all over the place and red herrings being thrown in every few minutes. This is a definite bonus for the film, however, as while it can get a little too confusing at times; there's always enough to hold the audience's interest and Miraglia's storytelling has improved since his earlier movie. The plot opens with a scene that sees two young girls fighting, before their grandfather explains to them the legend behind a rather lurid painting in their castle. The legend revolves around a woman called 'The Red Queen' who, legend has it, returns from the grave every hundred years and kills seven people. A few years later, murders begin to occur...<br /><br />Even though he only made two Giallo's, Miraglia does have his own set of tributes. It's obvious that the colour red is important to him, as it features heavily in both films; and he appears to have something against women called 'Evelyn'. He likes castles, Gothic atmospheres and stylish murders too - which is fine by me! Miraglia may be no Argento when it comes to spilling blood, but he certainly knows how to drop an over the top murder into his film; and here we have delights involving a Volkswagen Beetle, and a death on an iron fence that is one of my all time favourite Giallo death scenes. The female side of the cast is excellent with the stunning Barbara Bouchet and Marina Malfatti heading up an eye-pleasing cast of ladies that aren't afraid to take their clothes off! The score courtesy of Bruno Nicolai is catchy, and even though it doesn't feature much of the psychedelic rock heard in The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave; it fits the film well. The ending is something of a turn-off, as although Miraglia revs up the Gothic atmosphere, it comes across as being more than a little bit rushed and the identity of the murderer is too obvious. But even so, this is a delightfully entertaining Giallo and one that I highly recommend to fans of the genre!",positive

"Please ignore the trolls... most of them haven't seen the movie. Ask a friend or someone you know and trust who is not a misogynist to give you an objective and honest opinion. I have watched all the other Marvel movies at least 5x including the ones that are arguably the worst ones like Incredible Hulk or Iron Man 2. I have already seen this film 2x and in my opinion is a solid addition to the Marvel universe and was actually even better the second time around. The storyline is interesting, the CGI is amazing and Brie Larson is bad ass as both Captain Marvel and Carol Danvers. The character is relatable and endearing while still being able to pull off the suspense of disbelief in being the most powerful superhero yet introduced into the Marvel universe. Her sardonic humor coupled with a little attitude really is spot on and makes the character all the more appealing. The overall writing maintains Marvel intensity peppered with humorous release valves along the way at just the right times. The only thing I felt could improve in the film was that it felt a little rushed. This is an origin story and a complicated one at that and so by adding in an intriguing plot twist as well as introduction of a host of new characters and the relationships between them is a lot to cover. Not enough time to explore some of the characters/relationships in depth to really get vested with anyone beyond Captain Marvel. That being said definitely recommend it highly for any age/gender and planning to go see it multiple times in the theater and I take my little girls as it definitely embraces female empowerment (I went and saw Infinity War 17x).",controversial
"Thoroughly enjoyable but mostly by-the-numbers super hero movie. Anyone who knows the character will have the thought in the back of their head 'how does a character this powerful coexist well in a movie with the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe'.  That's not really resolved by this movie, and we already had a glimpse of the 'Gods amongst mortals' (literally) when Thor arrives at the battle for Wakanda.nnI personally didn't think the feminist tones were overdone, especially as the bulk of them were in the late 80s military.  nnMy biggest complaint is that they vastly simplified a complex intergalactic conflict for the benefit of a generic plot point.nnI'm pretty sure I cheered aloud when the Captain truly came into her power, so, as I said, the movie itself is really enjoyable within the context of itself.  (It could use more Coulson though, but then again, he's my favorite MCU character.

The overall impression is that someone was given a below average script, wannabe actors, an average director and absolutely no budget whatsoever.

"The Academy Award winning 'Kramer vs. Kramer' follows a snazzy businessman Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) and his divorce with his bored wife (Meryl Streep). One day Ted's wife leaves him and their child in search for a better life, forcing Ted to become closer to his son (Justin Henry). The two bond and become very close (but only after some friction), and just as everything is going perfect Ted's wife comes back to town and wants sole custody of their son. Ted then goes on a mission not to let his son get taken away from him, and fights his wife in court. Dustin Hoffman gives a tremendous performance along with Meryl Streep, and young Justin Henry is impressive.

The soundtrack drove me nuts, I'm aware this movie is supposed to be an empowering movie, but forcing it down everyone's throats isn't the best way to do it.  If the creative team could've taken notes from Wonder Woman maybe it could've been done right.  I did not like the change of Mar Vell either, a brave marvel Kree warrior changed to fit some agenda.

Samuel Jackson and Jude Law saved this movie. Without them it would have been easily forgettable. This is the ONLY MCU movie I have not watched a 2nd time or more.

"The beautiful, charming, supremely versatile and talented Irene Dunne is one of the greatest 5 or 6 actresses of American cinema. In Over 21 - as in all her films - she lights up the screen with a natural, yet glamorous presence. She is simultaneously authentic and human, AND a charismatic, inspirational model. This role is quintessential Irene Dunne, full of pathos and wit and a little mischief. I love all of her films, and this film was a fantastic new discovery for me when TCM aired it last night. I hope they don't wait years to air it again.<br /><br />Likewise, Charles Coburn is one of the greatest character actors in all of American filmdom. True, he often portrays variations on the same theme, but I never tire of watching his soft-hearted curmudgeons. Here his character is the perfect foil for Irene Dunne, and he is portrayed perfectly by Coburn. Their conflicts in this film are absolutely fantastic. They never miss a beat. In addition, they represent the central conflict of the film and the moral conflict of Irene Dunne's husband, portrayed by Alexander Knox.<br /><br />I am not as familiar with Knox's work. He was recognizable, but that was about all. However, cast with Dunne and Coburn, he holds his own. He delivers a fine, nuanced performance. His character has noble motives that are made accessible to us by Knox's performance and never held over us like some holy grail. He is noble, but conflicted and doubts his ability to successfully complete OCS. His interaction with Dunne, is always convincing, too. Dunne supports him without being syrupy or becoming a martyr, and he responds in kind. Their scenes are very well done.<br /><br />The film, itself, is a fantastic snapshot of a moment and a milieu not portrayed in other movies. I don't recall off the top of my head another movie that portrays America still fighting WWII, but with the end in sight and the focus on the establishment of the post-war world. Not the usual WWII movie! That in itself is interesting; it is also essential to the plot and the movie's message. In contrast to other commentators, I thought that the climactic speech was okay, but not great. It was delivered very well by Knox, but it was not as ""tightly"" written as the build-up led me to expect. I have heard better cinematic speeches addressing very similar themes. It served its purpose.<br /><br />For me, the greater value of the movie, was the depiction of the life of Dunne and Knox, as it reflected the typical OCS experience. The sense of community among the wives living on Palmetto Terrace seemed absolutely authentic - as did Palmetto Terrace, itself, despite the fact that it was obviously a sound stage set. The incredibly brief encounters between the wives and their OCS husbands. The rigors of the OCS candidates, mastering the difficult and complex material they had to learn. The shabby ""base housing"" - obviously hastily constructed. The tired and worn furnishings. The constant and harrowingly short deadlines - for returning to base, for learning lessons, for catching trains to subsequent ""posts."" Tenants constantly running into their predecessors and successors in the base housing, as they were moving in and out. Yes, I suspect this was a glimpse of a real WWII experience - clothed in some comedy, but very real at its core. I loved it, and I recommend it highly.",positive
"This series would have been a lot better if they had just done one simple thing: Made Ian McShane Code Name: Diamond Head instead of Code Name: Tree. Diamond Head the character needs someone who could handle the role of the lovable rogue, which McShane proved he could do with the Lovejoy series. Roy Thinnes, the actual Diamond Head, is really only so-so in the role. McShane is not really that good as the bad guy Tree. France Nuyen's character, Tso-Tsing, can't seem to make up her mind as to whether she's the hapless victim or the tough-and-ready-to-fight woman. She really earned her pay at the end when she had to play the role of Diamond Head's lover. After viewing an episode or two, I ended up not caring what happened to anyone.

Hoover aside, This story of a life in the FBI as told by Jimmy Stewart makes for a decent, but dated film. Vera Miles as his devoted wife is also good. But Jimmy is the movie. As much as Hoover controlled production and always made sure the FBI was seen without fault, Jimmy Stewart gave the film a human side,quite an achievement considering Hoover was always looking over his shoulder. The background score is also pleasant. I have read recent online articles suggesting that this is a forgotten film. Jimmy Stewart was one of the greatest film stars of all time and none of his films should be forgotten. TCM was the last network to show it a long time ago and I hope they show it again.",positive

"Movies like this one, and C.R.A.Z.Y., make me very sad for American films with a gay subject matter. With the exception of Parting Glances and Brokeback Mountain, there are few other notable American films with the kind of depth and sincerity as this movie, The Bubble. This movie centers on two men, Noam and Ashwar, an Israle and Palestinian respectively. Their relationship is complicated by the tension between the Jews and Arabs in Israel. Couples, in the early stages of their relationships will struggle with who will call who next, or who will say ""I love you"" first. Noam and Ashwar's early love is complicated by suicide bombings, armed security check points, and racism. While Noam's friends accept and like Ashwar, who is Arab, it is clear that most of Tel Aviv's citizens probably don't.<br /><br />One of the most touching moments, and there are many in this film, is when Noam and Ashwar attend a production of ""Bent"". We, as movie goers, see them watching this play, and the affect it has on the two of them is profoundly captured in their eyes. And ultimately, this touching moment is played out in a very sad way in the finale of the movie.<br /><br />Ohad Knoller and Youseff 'Joe' Sweid are outstanding as Noam and Ashwar. Director Eytan Fox is brilliant in creating a cogent and interesting retelling of the Shakespeare classic Romeo and Juliet. And while most movies today have sex in them, (almost as a sport), this one goes back to the old tried and true version of sex with love and passion combined. It is so refreshing. Also refreshing is seeing two gay men being portrayed as people and not cartoons. There are cartoonish characters in this movie. It just doesn't happen to be the two gay guys for a change. Somewhere on this site I think I read a comparison between this movie and ""Friends"". Well, not really. Yes, these are youthful characters stumbling through their first uneasy steps into adulthood and relationships. But I don't recall getting ""blowed up"" as a backdrop to the insipid story lines in ""Friends"".<br /><br />This is a very good movie. It has heart, and heartbreak. And like all good love stories love does win out. But not in it's intact glory of full bloom . Still, it's a very satisfying movie to watch.",positive
3rd attempt to review this poor excuse for a movie.  All corporate and nothing original.,controversial
"The Unborn tells the tale of a married couple named Virginia (Brooke Adames) & Bradley Marshall (Jeff Hayenga) who have tried for the last five years to conceive, Virginia has had two miscarriages since then & is desperate to have a child. They visit Dr. Richard Meyerling (James Karen) for help after he is recommended by some of their friends, Dr. Meyerling says he will be able to help them have a child. Dr. Meyerling operates on Virginia & it is soon confirmed that the surgery has been a success & Virginia is pregnant. At first everything seems perfect & the Marshall's couldn't be happier, but their picture perfect lives don't last for long as Virginia's pregnancy develops problems, she becomes moody & acts totally out of character & she receives a worrying phone call from Beth (Jane Cameron), another woman who has undergone Dr. Meyerling's procedure, who claims that Meyerling is in fact using his patients for his own sinister ends & is in fact a disgraced genetic researcher. Virginia begins to question just what is growing inside of her...<br /><br />Produced & directed by Rodman Flender I actually thought The Unborn was a decent horror/thriller (it's DEFINITELY NOT a sci-fi film as the IMDb would have you believe) that pleasantly surprised me. The script by Henry Dominic tries to be different & it must take some credit for that at least. The Unborn goes for psychological horror rather than cheap scares & bad special effects, it's got quite a clever story that works & plays on basic human fears. It moves along at a fair pace although it's not exactly an action packed film by any means. The climax was good & seemed a fitting way to round things off & the warnings about messing around with genetics seem even more relevant today than it must have been back then, maybe Flender knew something the rest of us didn't. On the down side it lacks some exploitation elements & is at heart a dialogue driven film mostly focusing on one person so it can get a bit dull at times. Also, I have to mention it, what on Erath was that grinning black skateboarding dwarf all about eh?!<br /><br />Director Flender does an OK job, The Unborn is far from the most stylish or visually interesting film ever made but it's good enough. The atmosphere is good & there's a fair bit of tension as what Virginia has inside of her & Dr. Meyerling's sinister plans aren't fully revealed until the last possible moment. Disappointingly the blood & gore is almost non existent which in a way lets the film down because in retrospect nothing really memorable happens, The Unborn relies on good storytelling which is fine but in a week I doubt I'll remember too much about it.<br /><br />Technically the film is OK, I'd imagine that The Unborn had a pretty low budget but it's well made even if it's a little bland & forgettable. The baby creature is actually a decent special effect & has fairly realistic facial movement. The acting is good & this was one of the first acting jobs credited to Friends (1994 - 2004) star Lisa Kudrow, I have to be honest I don't like Friends & I don't even know who she was in this so I can't tell you how she did.<br /><br />The Unborn is a good horror/thriller that deserves to be more widely known & seen, it's far better than a lot of low budget crap that litter video shop shelves. If your a horror fan & are looking for something a bit different, something slightly more intelligent & thought provoking than usual then I think you could do a lot worse than The Unborn. Followed by a dumbed down sequel The Unborn II (1994) which I watched straight after this, check my review out if you want..",positive
"I found this film the first time when I was searching for some works in witch Stéphane Rideau had participate, still in an extraordinary ravishment caused by the astonishingly beautiful «Les roseaux sauvages» (in Portuguese, Juncos Silvestres), by André Téchiné. I was searching for similar movies, in the come of age line. I found then «Presque Rien», a movie where the director Sébastien Lifshitz deliciously amazes us, earning a nomination by the Cannes festival in 2000. The story is about two guys, the kind «boy next door», Mathieu (Jérémie Elkaïm) and Cédric (Stéphane Rideau), who meet during the summer vacations. In a land far from where he lives, Mathieu spends is days at the beach with his sister. There he meets Cédric, a local, with whom he starts this estival and revealing relationship, much by means of the sensual and seducer personality that Stéphane Rideau gives his characters, (in «Les roseaux sauvages», 6 years younger, he still preserves the innocence of the sweet seducer, witch matures here in experience). Exemplar in directing, in the amorous sequence, in the intimate and confessing description that is made about a boys first facing his (still ambiguous) sexuality and great love. The first love, in its terrible progression ecstasy-despair. The best of the film is the best of France: the fervent passion, the hot and excited rationalism, the brownish beauty, the simple and natural acceptance made by the families, although not without surprise and first anger. Still, there is the beach, the luminosity, the lightness e simplicity of summer, the freshness of breeze, the surge&#8217;s melody, and the expressive eyes of an introverted Elkaïm (hesitant, hurt, puzzled, passionate). The sex is not avoided nor exploited, it is treated as it is, with no exhibitionist intention. In virtue of pure talent, this is a work of drama of uncommon quality, without cheap sentimentalism, showing an inevitably real image of two homosexual in their prime youth as any ordinary person, although with a social fear of rejection and shame. It is well worthy being seen, especially by those who adore French movies (although the DVD front cover is very lame, with the two actors in between tens of stars, greased with brilliantine). A movie witch, in my opinion, deserves an 8-9!",positive
"In one word... abysmal. I give it one star for the hippie sex scenes and eye candy women, otherwise forget it. Corman's worst effort, bar none. Ben Vereen should have had his name permanently stricken from the cast. I cannot believe that this is now going to be on DVD (as of 2/15/05) with ""Wild In The Streets"" - another retro stinker. I woke up sick in bed this morning with a cold, decided to watch a movie to cheer me up some, scanned the digital channels... the premise looked interesting enough because I like viewing B-movie sci-fi, hippie culture and rebellious teen flicks. It seemed familiar somehow and with Ben Vereen in the cast, I thought... why not? What a big mistake... it was a horrible start to my day.<br /><br />Only after viewing it, I now know why the familiarity crept into the recesses of my newly-awakened brain. I remembered seeing coming attractions for this film as a 14-year old (I'm 45), back in the early/mid-seventies at the Sombrero, a local art theater that no longer exists... the whole theater laughed hysterically and even groaned out loud at how bad this movie looked. Acting: dreadful, story: awful, cinematography: nearly-awful, music: terrible, sound: horrendous, directing: a joke. If you choose to watch this after my warning, remember... ""I told you so.""<br /><br />""Gass-s-s-s"" is the perfect title for this film... you feel ""gassed"" after viewing this putrid movie - or maybe that you should be taken to a ""gas"" chamber for wasting your brain away.

"I turned this on to see the incredible Ethel Waters, whose autobiography I am now reading. I'll admit my jaw dropped when the pork chops and watermelon references started rolling in, but people cannot look at this movie as a stereotypical or racist piece. It's pretty much a short film made by blacks, for blacks at a time when the entertainment industry was quite segregated and the stereotypes to the people involved were the jokes of their time, old trends exaggerated for humor. We see modern black movies do the same thing, but with the new trends (stereotypes), ""ho's"" and the ""hood"" and such. I think if you look back in eighty years, you would find today's movies will look just as racist. What viewers should appreciate about this film is the talent of Waters and the pint-sized Sammy Davis Jr., who out taps his contemporary, Shirley Temple, and looks remarkably the same facially as he did as an adult. Everyone involved in this film clearly had a lot of fun making it. Why not enjoy it for what it is, instead of what you think it should have been?",positive
"I really enjoyed it! I was happily surprised by the interesting plot and beautiful cinematography. Have always liked Larson so a bit biased in my love for her as Carol. It had good funny moments and some beautiful moving moments. I think the most common critique I've seen so far is ""no/little character development"" and I technically agree but I don't think that's a detriment, the film honestly doesn't hinge on some deep character change but rather character-reacquaintance. It works both as a great origin story and connection/tie into the Marvel expanded universe. Definitely a recommend if you like Marvel and the fun in Superhero movies.",positive

There was a lot of criticism for Brie Larsson, but I actually enjoyed her. She wasn't all depression nor cheerfulness, she's just a down-to-earth woman. The only thing I didn't like about her was the way she stands with her arms straight down like she was an action figure. Samuel L. Jackson was great. If this movie would have been released in 2012, it would have been praised.

"Captain marvel was perfectly ok. It has been interesting following the drama leading up to this movie. Some accuse it of being too SJW infused and worry Marvel will ruin the MCU like Disney has been messing up Star Wars. On the other side, feminists have been hailing this movie as the best thing sense sliced bread, and if you disagree, you are a misogynist pig. In my opinion, after seeing this movie in theaters, both viewpoints were overblown. The movie wasn't too heavy on the SJW front, as I had feared, nor was it one of the best marvel movies the franchise has put out. I would rank it somewhere above Ant Man, and below Captain America: Winter Solder. The movie had plenty of explosions and some fun quippy bits between Fury and Carol Danvers. In the end, it was a fun addition to the MCU, but not a particularly memorable one.  Hope you find this helpful",controversial
It does not have a rhythm. It is lost among references. The references to the 90s are poor and some wrong. Brie Larson gives us a Mary Sue style character.

"Late into the endgame, Marvel introduces us to its latest superhero. Captain Marvel is a lot of fun, with humor, exciting action, and a differently structured story than the norm, but it struggles to bring a variety of new ideas and produce as mind-blowing of results as previous entries. Brie Larson is a talented actress, who has given several exceptional performances, but she appears somewhat restricted in this role, either by her own limits or by the direction, hard to say. The way the film portrays the title character is good enough to become invested, but will, hopefully, be more rewarding as she progresses in later movies, hopefully under the direction of someone with a strong vision and style to improve upon the foundation. Samuel L. Jackson stands out as one of the more memorable aspects. His natural charisma reacting to the sci-fi elements and absurdity is a highlight of the film. In an attempt to separate itself from the normal superhero story structure, the film progresses its plot in non-chronological order. This is a somewhat refreshing way to tell a usual origin story, and should be commended for its ambition, but the story itself can still be predictable. While this is not necessarily detrimental to the film as a whole, when a film comes in as the 21st addition to a franchise, they have to pull off something astounding and unique to stand out. However, while the superhero story may not be anything new, Captain Marvel follows through with entertaining action and effective humor. The writing balances a serious and a playful tone about as well as it should. It is definitely on par with some of the other solo films of the series. It is difficult to pin down aspects that were especially astounding and what was especially disappointing, as the film goes back and forth between ambitious and fairly standard. Overall, Captain Marvel is a welcome addition to this impressive franchise and presents a welcome character with room to grow, but it has little to make it stand out as much as its predecessors and remains as a filler episode in a show that is nearing a finale.",negative

An underwhelming overhyped disaster. Brie Larson is by far the least likeable actress in the MCU. This is nothing but agenda pushing propaganda to keep telling women that aren't worthy.

"This is a good movie that should have been a great one. The real problem is a case of ""show it don't say it"". nnThe whole ""contain your emotions"" narrative amounted to nothing as containing her emotions never seemed to prevent her from accomplishing anything she wants to do, and at no point did using her emotions allowed her to overcome anything. She overpowers the dampening device on her neck using the powers she already had and her emotions never entered into the equation.nnWe don't see her undergoing any growth as a character.

Could they have been just as misinformed by the Supreme Intelligence as Carole was about the evil of the Skrulls?nnHow about some inner conflict upon realizing the atrocities she has committed against the Skrulls? How many innocent people has she massacred before learning the truth? What effect does it have on her emotional wellbeing?nnShe should show at least some of the five stages of loss (denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance) whether for the loss of her previous life / memories, or loss of the innocent lives she has taken.nnThe only sense of emotion we do get from her is when Maria tells her about the person she was before the memory wipe. It would be great for her to deal with what she has gone through instead of ignoring it completely.

"Wonder Woman may have beaten her to the punch but Carol Danvers, a.k.a. Captain Marvel, deserves her own share of headlines as the first woman to have her own starring vehicle in the highly successful Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Her presence was first teased in the post-credit scene of Infinity War. After twenty-one films, Captain Marvel gets squeezed into the penultimate chapter before closing the book on the MCU as we know it for a decade, and it feels like a throwback in both good and bad ways.nnCarol Danvers (Brie Larson), or Ă˘VersĂ˘? as she's known on the Kree home planet, is part of an elite alien squad of Ă˘noble warrior heroesĂ˘? fighting in a long-running war against another alien race, the shape-shifting Skrulls. Carol Danvers goes back to her home planet of Earth (a.k.a. Planet C-53) in the 1990s to look for a hidden weapon linked to a mentor she can't quite remember, a woman (Annette Bening) from her past life on Earth as an Air Force pilot. Carol Danvers must try and recall who she is with the help of Agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and stay one step ahead from the invading Skrulls.nnThis definitely feels like a lower-to-mid tier Marvel entry, something more akin to the Phase One years (2008-2012) where the initial franchises were just starting to get a sense of direction and personality. They were also lacking the larger depth of character development, social and political messaging, as well as judicious independence from the overall studio formula that has come to define dozens of superhero blockbusters. It's not a bad movie, and is fairly entertaining throughout its 124-minute run time, but it's hard not to notice the shortcomings that, frankly, haven't been this transparent in an MCU movie for some years now. I had to think back on a comparable MCU experience and I had to go back to 2015 with Avengers: Age of Ultron or maybe even 2013's Thor: The Dark World. In short, Captain Marvel just feels a little less super in many important areas.nnThis is the first female-lead superhero film in the MCU (sorry Black Widow) and Carol Danvers has been a character in Marvel comics since 1968, and yet the film doesn't put together a compelling case why she is the one getting her big screen moment. The character suffers that wonderfully tired movie trope of the foggy memory, so we have a protagonist trying to discover who she is alongside the audience. This would be a fine starting point for her to essentially reclaim her humanity and her agency as she travels back to good ole C-53 and learns more about her past. There's a core of a beginning theme already present there, the nature of what it means to be human, and how it can be viewed as a weakness by n alien species and how it comes to be a strength for her. Maybe that's too pat but it's a start. The problem is that Carol Danvers isn't seen to be that interesting. She's somewhat boring and the presentation feels a tad inauthentic; when she's quippy it feels forced, and when she's badass it feels lethargic. There's a personal journey that challenges her to assess her preconceived notions of good and evil in an ongoing intergalactic conflict, but it's so impersonal. Even when she's revisiting with friends and reminiscing (what she can) it doesn't feel like we're getting that much more insight than we had before. She's a warrior. She's upstanding. She definitely doesn't like men telling her what she can and cannot do. But what else do we know besides her increasingly invincible super powers? What is most important to her that drives her? What are her flaws other than a faulty memory? When she goes full super saiyan it should be celebratory and joyous and instead it feels more weirdly perfunctory.nnI love Larson as an actress and have been singing her praises for dramas (Room, Short Term 12) and comedies (21 Jump Street, Scott Pilgrim) for years, and I kept waiting and waiting to be wowed by her in this role. I was left unfulfilled. Larson is a terrific actress and can be so expressive, resolute, heartbreaking, and inspiring, and I grew frustrated as the movie kept her talents buttoned up for too long. She seems too removed from the action even as it's happening in the moment. It's not that she's too serious (Ă˘smile moreĂ˘? chime the denizens of cretinous Ă˘men's rights activistsĂ˘?) because her character should be serious. It's that she hasn't been given enough depth and interest a hero deserves.nnNate's Grade: B-",negative

"Overall, somewhat entertaining. The lack of character development was obvious throughout the movie and please stop with the politics and propaganda on our movies. Thank you!",controversial
"Putting aside all the political reasons why people feel like this movie should be infallible and pointing out that, yes, I am indeed a woman, not an 'angry white man' who seem to be the only ones allowed to criticize this film, I will give my honest opinion: It was just ok. The plot was good. The action and effects were good. Samuel Jackson was incredible as usual.nBrie? She has the emotional range of a phone box in this movie. Which is ironic because her character keeps being told to ""control her emotions."" What emotions, exactly? Snark, anger, and wit? She has those in spades. This is very disappointing to me because I would love to have another female superhero that's relatable that I can look up to. (For a reference on how this is done well, see the CW's Supergirl). Carol Danvers just was not relatable at all. And yet people treat her like she can do no wrong. Why? For politics.nI'm not here for politics. I'm here for a good superhero movie.

I'd say it was on par with Thor 2 BUT the reason I'd say it's a little worse is the way us fans are being treated by MEDIA OUTLETS!nnThe Good about the film: Sam Jackson (although Nick Fury is no longer a mysterious bad ass anymore)nnThe first act with Brie Larson before earth was actually decent.nnThe Bad: So many unnecessary retcons/reimagining of characters. Bad writing and bland story. Brie Larson NOT a bad actress BUT so miscast in this role it kinda makes me fear going to see END GAME.nnThis movie wasn't asked for by anyone and would have been better off being introduced like Black Panther in Civil War with an origin story after a End Game.nnWhat makes this the worst Marvel movie is I've tried 7 times to post this review and it hasn't appeared. Yet for a test I posted a generic review for Spider-Man: into the spider verse and BAM instantly posted. How dare you RT try and silence us, especially when my post is genuine.

"Abysmal really. Sure there were some laughs, but the entire movie was being carried by the supporting actors, and dragged down by the lead, Captain Marvel. Whether this was the fault of writers, director, or the actor is irrelevant. The entire movie she came across as a condescending flippant narcissist, and that was the only cadence she had. Any serious moment was instantly denied by it. Any emotional growth was denied by it. Heck, logically, I think she was supposed to go from ""emotionally chained"" at the start to ""emotionally free"" but she didn't grow at all. Rather, the people telling her she was too emotional from the start displayed far more than her. And because of her mono-cadence every other character had to bend to it. All characters instantly bent to her authority, previously ""intimidating"" characters were portrayed as silly because they'd say something, get flippantly responded to, and because they weren't allowed to pop her bubble they then had to gasp around like dead fish. Cut the main character out and you will get maybe 30 minutes of good movie and fun jokes.",positive

"Huge MEH on this. Captain Marvel was not a really good character in this movie, and I think it was partially due to the script and partially due to the bland acting from the actress. I enjoyed some of the special effects and certain aspects of this movie, but the poor acting and sometimes distracting music and humor drew away from the plot majorly.  Speaking of the plot, there really wasn't much of it in the first place, and I left the theatre feeling unsatisfied and kind of wanting more. I liked the costume design for Captain Marvel and the young Samuel L. Jackson makeup/CG, but that's as far as I can say for the costumes. The antagonist/protagonist aliens just looked cheap and too put-on, though they sold me on their performance. Come on, with a Marvel stamp on this title, I expected so much more.",negative

"Return to the 36th Chamber is one of those classic Kung-Fu movies which Shaw produces back in the 70s and 80s, whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of Hollywood, and the protagonist Gordon Liu, the counterpart to the western's Clint Eastwood. Digitally remastered and a new print made for the Fantastic Film Fest, this is ""Presented in Shaw Scope"", just like the good old days.<br /><br />This film is a simple story of good versus evil, told in 3 acts, which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that era.<br /><br />Act One sets up the premise. Workers in a dye-mill of a small village are unhappy with their lot, having their wages cut by 20% by incoming manchu gangsters. They can't do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters, and their boss. At first they had a minor success in getting Liu to impersonate a highly skilled Shaolin monk (one of the best comedy sequences), but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many times.<br /><br />Act Two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob. However, without real martial arts, he embarks on a journey to Shaolin Temple, to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly. After some slapstick moments, he finally gets accepted by the abbot (whom he impersonated!) but is disappointed at the teaching methods - kinda like Mr Miyagi's style in Karate Kid, but instead of painting fences, he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple. Nothing can keep a good man down, and he unwittingly builds strength, endurance and learns kung-fu the unorthodox way.<br /><br />Act Three is where the fight fest begins. With cheesy sound effects, each obvious non-contact on film is given the maximum impact treatment. But it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here, with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners, and the use of slow-motion only to showcase stunts in different angles. You may find the speed of fights a tad too slow, with some pause in between moves, but with Yuen Wo Ping and his style being used ad-nausem in Hollywood flicks, they sure don't make fight scenes like they used to! Return to the 36th chamber gets a repeat screening on Monday, so, if you're game for a nostalgic trip down memory lane, what are you waiting for?",positive
"The first half of the film is OK, the second half one of the most tedious experiences imaginable. Quite possibly the most overrated movie of all time.

"It could have been a better film. It does drag at points, and the central story shifts from Boyer completing his mission to Boyer avenging Wanda Hendrix's death, but Graham Greene is an author who is really hard to spoil. His stories are all morality tales, due to his own considerations of Catholicism, guilt and innocence (very relative terms in his world view), and the human condition.<br /><br />Boyer is Luis Denard, a well-known concert pianist, who has sided with the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. He has been sent to England to try to carry through an arms purchase deal that is desperately needed. Unfortunately for Denard he is literally on his own - everyone of his contacts turns out to be a willing turncoat for the Falagists of Spain. In particular Katina Paxinou (Mrs. Melendez) a grim boarding house keeper, and Peter Lorre (Mr. Contreras) a teacher of an ""esperanto"" type international language. Wanda Hendrix is the drudge of a girl (Else) who works for Mrs. Melendez. The local diplomat, Licata (Victor Francken) is already a willing associate of the Falangists.<br /><br />The Brits (Holmes Herbert, Miles Mander, and best - if not worst - of the lot, George Coulouris) don't give much hope to Boyer's cause (which he soon grasps may be Britain's before long). Herbert and Mander just retreat behind the official policy of neutrality ordered by the Ramsay MacDonald's and Stanley Baldwin's governments during the Civil War. Coulouris here is a typical Col. Blimp type - always impeccable in his native English diction, he is sharp in showing his dislike for foreigners in general.<br /><br />The one ray of hope is Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen), here trying to play her role as well as she can - but she can't really. She's an aristocrat - the daughter of a Press lord. It was Bacall's second film, and (sad to say) almost sank her long career. She does act well, but the spark she showed in her first film was due to the dual effect of starring with Humphrey Bogart and being directed by Howard Hawks. Boyer is a fine actor, but he's not Bogie, and Herman Shumlin is not Hawks. Her next film returned her to Bogie and Hawks again, and her star resumed it's ascendancy.<br /><br />It's a bleak film (as was the novel). Boyer's mission never succeeds, as he has too many hidden foes all over the place. But the villains are likewise also losers - frequently with their lives.<br /><br />With Dan Seymour as a suspicious foreign tenant of Katina Paxinou (and the man who destroys her). It is well worth watching to catch the Warner's lot of character actors doing their best given the weakness in direction.",positive
"I expected worse from the trailers, but this movie is good even if it's on the not so special side most of the time.nnSometimes I liked how No-nonsense the main lead was but the majority of the time she feels like a female Thor in Thor 1 mixed with amnesia, I loved everything about the Earthlings, I loved the cat and I was bored as hell by the villains.nnSerioussly, those mindless space drones have no personal reasons other than ""Must follow orders"" and is ESPECIALLY noticeable right after you saw how interesting Thanos was.nnThe story is decent, nothing too special except for the FLOPPING TESSERACT APPEARING AGAIN, because I kept asking myself ""Why the hell is the Tesseract here? Didn't they discover it WITH Cap?"".nnI know that there is an explaination, but that's just how I felt when I saw that forsaken blue cube popping up again.nn(Also when Captain Marvel broke free of the control and started glowing, I could not stop imagining Vegeta saying ""She has risen beyond, into the realm if legend! She has finally become... A SUPER SAIYAN!"").nnEven if I said the story was decent, sometimes the action felt... anticlimactic, like when there are spaceships knocking at the atmosphere and she just flies up, smashes one, and Ronan is like ""Oh shit I'm out!"".nnI get it that was meant to represent how powerful she is, but it kinda fails since the only way I know she is stronger than most heroes is because I was told she is.nnIf you ask me Thanos would not even need all the stones to fend her off, she looks at best like a moon destryer in terms of power.nnOverall, I enjoyed it, but it is nowhere near as good as it could have been, the protagonist's powers and personality are kinda bland (even though she has her moments), the villains suck, the story is just fine, the supporting cat - I mean cast was great and the action edging on the anticlimactic side at the end (during the climax, how Ironic!)nnIf I can add a little Post Scriptum, I assumes that this movie's main character and overall theme would have been ""mEn SuCk WaMeN pOwAh!"", never been so glad to be wrong.nn7/-, so 3 1/2 stars seem like a close enough vote.",negative
"This is an ""odysessy through time"" via computer animation, supposedly th work of over 300 artists. Made in the late '80s and released in 1990, this was cutting edge stuff for the day. I thought it was good and quite interesting in spots.<br /><br />Most of the short scenes made no sense, just forms evolving into other forms, but that was fun to watch. This is all about visuals, not really about any kind of a story. There were some strange sequences in which odd-looking men- creatures would dance around with birds overheard. All of it is computer animated which was new back then. Even the term ""computer animated"" was not well-known.<br /><br />It's simply a chance to show off this new technology in short bits of cartoon-like happenings with beautiful colors and imaginative scenes. No words, just pictures with electronic music. Stoners must have really loved this.<br /><br />It's a nice, intriguing 40 minutes of ""eye candy"" and ""head candy."" By today's CG effects this may have lost impact, but I think you'd still be entertained by this.",positive
"This isn't a very good movie, but it is easily the best Troma Studios film I have ever viewed. Lloyd Kaufman - the ""brains"" behind Troma - isn't concerned with a good plot or even making a moderately entertaining film. His chief concern is making something bizarre. And his definition of bizarre oftentimes mirrors my definition of terrible cinema.<br /><br />In this film we have the titled character Luther - whose favorite pastime isn't Baseball, but biting the heads off of chickens - receiving his release from lockup. The board has deemed him rehabilitated despite the fact that he doesn't speak - he merely clucks like a chicken - and has a set of razorblade dentures at his disposal. Of course, once Luther is set free, he goes about causing mayhem, first at a grocery store and later at a farm house.<br /><br />VIOLENCE: $$$$$ (Lots of violence in this oftentimes tasteless flick. Luther sinks his razorblade chompers into a poor elderly lady waiting at a bus stop and then spends the rest of the film terrorizing the mother and daughter at the farmhouse).<br /><br />NUDITY: $$$$$ (Stacy Haiduk delivers some noteworthy skin in his picture, as the former Lois Lane (I can't recall which Superman edition she was from) gives us a shower scene followed by a romp in bed with her boyfriend - a guy who just doesn't have any chemistry with Ms. Haiduk. The extended shower scene footage in the DVD extras gives the viewer quite a bit more of Stacy. She is quite something).<br /><br />STORY: $ (Forgettaboutit!!!! Whitey Styles' screenplay may just be the worst ever written. The way in which Luther is released from the asylum completely throws all credibility out the window. His dialogue is something that a pre-schooler might write and the actions he writes for his characters border on the absurd. It's as if Styles spent ten years without human contact and completely forgot how people react in certain situations).<br /><br />ACTING: $$ (The film belongs to Edward Terry who actually does a decent job as the Geek. He is quite menacing in a stupid barnyard fashion. Joan Roth as the mother does a super job in support but Haiduk and her boyfriend's lack of chemistry made their roles awkward at best).",negative

"A friend lent me this DVD, which he got from the director at a festival, I think. I went in warned that some of the technical aspects of the movie were a bit shaky and that the writing was good but not great. So maybe that colored my judgment but I have to admit that I liked this movie.<br /><br />The standouts where the actors. Youssef Kerkor was really good as Ernie, the main character, kind of pathetic in a likable way. Adam Jones (who also directed) and Justin Lane were excellent as the roommates who drive Ernie mad. The Bill character (Justin Lane), who spends a lot of the film dressed like a panda, was by far my favorite; he seemed the least one-dimensional, and reminded me of an old college roommate so much I called the guy after watching the DVD. Really kind of lovable, and very funny. Some of the other acting was good, some was so-so, but none of it was bad. I also really liked the vigilante duo. Ridiculous and funny.<br /><br />I'm giving this one high marks, even though it has some issues, because you can tell when you watch it that these people cared, and decided to make their movie their way. Well done to Adam Jones and crew.",positive
"It's not terrible. The acting is fine, though the actors aren't really tested. The CGI is acceptable. There isn't anything that blows me away, but I don't have any complaints either. There are compelling elements in the story that could have been a part of a very good movie. However, the storytelling is disjointed and humor seems a bit misplaced.  There are three major stories told in this movie. The best involves a prominent scientist who realizes her leaders are very bad people. She must decide if she should sacrifice all she holds dear to save the innocent from destruction. She faces the choice of Schindler. Her's is a compelling story. The second story involves a man who goes up against near insurmountable odds to find and save his family. He must battle his conscience and risk becoming as bad as the enemy he rightly despises. He watches many friends die as they attempt to help him on this quest. He's Captain John Miller saving Private Ryan.  The third story involves a girl who grows up in a comfortable middle class environment. Her father is seemingly unsupportive, but she has a best friend and surrogate parents to help her along. She seemingly falls down a lot, but to her credit she always gets back up. She selflessly sacrifices herself.  This leads to her getting powers (through no effort on her part) that, once she learns about them, make her almost laughably powerful.  Her mentor dies, but otherwise she lost nothing along the way. This is a nice enough story, but the others are far more compelling. I'm disappointed that this is the one they spent almost the entire movie telling.",positive

"Flashdance is one of those awful, stupid movies that you actually kind-of enjoy, just because they're so crap. I just watched it on TV & my friend and I were amazed at how dopey it was. It's true that Don Simpson and the other producers came up with the idea of a fairly cheap, lowbrow flick with lots of sweaty bodies to help sell a soundtrack of (admitedly catchy) pop, so Flashdance is an odd sort of pioneer: the first MTV movie. Adrian Lyne started out in advertising and it shows because Flashdance is almost a commercial for itself. You've already decided to watch it but the movie has this weird, panicky undercurrent, as though it's frightened that you might change your mind at any moment. It keeps selling itself to you over and over, all the way through, using slick commercial-style editing and glossy close-ups of jiggling breasts. The story is wafer thin (I honestly can't think of another film I've seen with less plot) and it never makes much sense, but its a very contrived, calculating movie, so it feels consistent. People say it's dated but Flashdance was always rubbish. Viewers in the early 80's knew it was just cheesy T&A but it does work in its own silly fashion. There's soppy romance for the chick-flick crowd and stacks of oily, writhing female bodies for their dates, all set to a pumping disco beat. How could it fail? It helps that the dialogue is pointless, so you can grab a popcorn without missing anything major and, if this sort of thing isn't your cup of tea, you can always laugh at the 'interpretive dance' on display. The scene where a stand-in for Jennifer Beals convulses/'dances' on stage in front of a TV with a fan in it and a face full of white clown make-up had us in stitches. A genuine guilty pleasure.",negative

"I mention that there may be a spoiler here just to be cautious because of what I discuss, although I don't really think I am giving away anything important. Any ""suprises"" are really unimportant to this film's success or a viewer's ability to enjoy it. <br /><br />While not without some very minor flaws, this is a beautiful and very moving film about friendship, time, uncertainty, and the choices people make about their lives. Yet, at the same time, it is also a very humorous film, with small, mostly understated bits of comedy woven in throughout. For much of the film, it progresses at a fairly leisurely pace, but it does not seem slow at all since the film draws one into it and into the lives of the characters, and at first it is mostly rather light-hearted. Some have commented that much of the film seems slow, but it is such a wonderful portrayal of the lives of such sympathetic characters that one could watch it almost endlessly. As it progresses, the film becomes more emotional and moving up to the very end and the progression is handled wonderfully. <br /><br />Eventually, some of the characters decide to rob a bank and although it is perhaps somewhat hard to believe, that is beside the point. It is a wonderful addition to emphasise the love that these friends have for each other while at the same time it accents the humour and adds a little more irony to the film. And, although hardly original to have a bunch of old guys rob a bank, the context and details are quite original and they do it wonderfully, making it really quite funny as well, such as when Ismet (if I remember correctly) exaggerates his aggressiveness to ""disguise"" the fact he's old.<br /><br />As I said, most of the other comedy is rather low-key but still very humorous so I was constantly chuckling throughout. <br /><br />The actors are probably the real key to this film. They imbue the characters with deep personality and sympathy and portray them with great care and warmth. There are some small transformations or tiny details of the characters' personalities which are pulled off smoothly and beautifully. Of course, the film is about the personalities of these very characters and how they care for and interact with one another. It succeeds so well because of them and if lesser actors had the roles the movie could well have failed.<br /><br />Gule Gule is not without sadness, but that simply provides the full range of emotions and provides a more powerful experience. In fact, the film is so moving and filled with so much love from such rich characters that it is in the end a very heart-warming, satisfying, and even happy film despite its sadness. I could watch it over and over.",positive

I must admit this is one of the best love movies, maybe the best of all, I have ever watched. The content and the form overlaps perfectly. As watching the secret love we see the characters in bounded frames that limits their movements as well as their feelings. Beautiful camera angles and the lighting makes the feelings and the blues even touchable. I want to congratulate Christopher Doyle and Pin Bing Lee for their fantastic cinematography which creates the mood for love. Also the music defines the sadness of the love which plays along the beautiful slow motion frames and shows the characters in despairing moods. And of course the performances of the actors which makes the love so real. Eventually, all the elements in the film combined in a perfect way under the direction of WKW and give the audience the feeling called love.",positive

"Being the only movie I was able to see at this year's ""Nordische Filmtage"" at Lübeck, this year's festival will be remembered as a all-time low for me.<br /><br />This movie, which was announced as an erotic thriller, is nothing more than a sick piece of crap! Excuse the language, but there aren't any decent words to describe it.<br /><br />First of all, the actors are not the best. But even better actors would not have rescued the movie. E.g. the plot: after the first 15 minutes it was quite clear that John was sick, the neighbour girls were not real and that he killed his first girlfriend. The so called ""sex-scene"" was nothing else but disgusting (hitting each other until blood flows for me hasn't anything to do with sexuality), but unfortunately that were not the only disgusting images to be shown. Everything else was copied by other directors like e.g. Lynch, but of course without their geniality.<br /><br />So, to summarize the whole film and to save other viewers time and money: guy loses girlfriend, girlfriend turns back home, guy kills girlfriend and becomes mad afterwards, guy imagines hot, but crazy neighbour girls, guy has very disgusting sex with one of them (or so he thinks), in the end he realizes, he is crazy and his girlfriend and her new lover lay in his apartment all the time... bad story, bad actors, pictures, that make you want to vomit...<br /><br />1 out of 10 (1 point for the fact, that you realize how good you can understand Norwegian if you learned Swedish - at least one benefit of the evening - and you can't choose 0 points here).",negative
"All politics aside, is Captain Marvel the worst superhero movie?  Absolutely not.  Fan4stic had the entire cast and crew attempting to disavow their participation within the movie before it came out.  The Hulk... well enough said.  Is it among the worst Marvel movies in the MCU?  Without a doubt.nnCaptain Marvel follows the character Carol Danvers, a US Airforce pilot from the late 80's who was given powers via an experimental alien engine explosion powered by the Tesseract 6 years after losing her memories to the same event that gave her powers.nnThe movie really struggles to find a tone or style at all.  From a very mundane car chase, to very bland fight scenes, to extremely poor character motivations - the movie feels like you're looking at the Mona Lisa... but the paint by numbers watercolor version.

"The worst MCU movie ever seen. Stupid humor, a Nick Fury ridiculed in favor of making Captain Marvel bigger by force. A horrible change of argument where the Skrull are now good, squandering a fearsome villain for the MCU. A protagonist with total lack of charisma and without a reasonable explanation why they make it so unnecessarily powerful, removing all possibility of a worthy rival. They make her strong because yes, without really connecting the audience with her story. You can see the forced feminism.

"Greetings again from the darkness. How rare it is for a film to examine the lost soul of men in pain. Adam Sandler stars as Charlie, a man who lost his family in the 9/11 tragedy, and has since lost his career, his reason to live and arguably, his sanity. Don Cheadle co-stars as Sandler's former Dental School roommate who appears to have the perfect life (that Sandler apparently had prior to 9/11).<br /><br />Of course the parallels in these men's lives are obvious, but it is actually refreshing to see men's feelings on display in a movie ... feelings other than lust and revenge, that is. Watching how they actually help each other by just being there is painful and heartfelt. Writer/Director Mike Binder (""The Upside of Anger"", and Sandler's accountant in this film) really brings a different look and feel to the film. Some of the scenes don't work as well as others, but overall it is well written and solidly directed.<br /><br />Sandler and Cheadle are both excellent. Sandler's character reminds a bit of his fine performance in ""Punch Drunk Love"", but here he brings much more depth. Cheadle is always fine and does a nice job of expressing the burden he carries ... just by watching him work a jigsaw puzzle.<br /><br />Support work is excellent by Jada Pinkett Smith (as Cheadle's wife), Liv Tyler (as a very patient psychiatrist), Saffron Burrows (in an oddly appealing role), Donald Sutherland as an irritated judge and Melinda Dillon and Robert Klein as Sandler's in-laws.<br /><br />The film really touches on how the tragic events of that day affected one man so deeply that he is basically ruined. In addition to the interesting story and some great shots of NYC, you have to love any film that features vocals from Chrissy Hynde, Bruce Springsteen and Roger Daltrey ... as well as Eddie Vedder impersonating Daltrey. Not exactly a chipper upbeat film, but it is a quality film with an unusual story.",positive
"Wasn't a bad movie, but wasn't something I'd recommend to someone who wanted to know what movies to see. Brie Larson possibly gave off one of the most uncharismatic performances of her career but is still pretty decent considering the script she was given. It could've taken advantage of the time period by adding some more tracks from the 90s but it did fit a good amount in considering the runtime and plot. Was pretty funny at times and I don't regret seeing it. Wouldn't recommend it but you should definitely watch it if your doing a Stan Lee Marvel marathon or are curious. ",negative

".The Shell of a Marvel Film - and that's about it.nnFirst, I'd like to start off by saying that I think Hollywood really takes for granted how trusted of a brand Marvel Studios is, especially after having to suffer all those years through a plethora of abhorrent/disappointing blockbuster films (i.e. Transformers, DC Comics, Star Wars, etc.) Nothing against ""Black Panther,"" but how many exceptional Marvel films do you honestly have to overlook in that context before you finally give in and say, ""You know -- these films might be major blockbusters, but they're successful for several reasons.""nnHaving said all this -- ""Captain Marvel"" is a legitimate let down.nnIs it the worst film ever? No.nnAlthough Brie Larson offered some pretty smug, divisive comments leading into the film -- personally, that should neither break nor make the film.nnFor starters, Brie Larson's performance seemed non-existent very much like Carol Danvers's backstory. There was very little to latch onto, which makes me wonder if there was a better way to interpret her forgettable past. Her personality even came off as cringeworthy a few times making her unbearable.nnSamuel L. Jackson's performance was great as the ""fresh"" Nick Fury. The CGI team did a great job of making him look younger; although no CGI could help him get through those stunt scenes. While his face might have looked young, Jackson's old age was pretty apparent in his physical performances. I still think his best action scene was his driving sequence in ""Captain America: Winter Soldier"" and nothing comes close to that in this film.nnAnd while I'm talking about Jackson, Goose scratching out Fury's eye was ridiculous. It kills the mystery behind his eye patch -- and I am now forever anticipating stupid run-on jokes about how some cat scratched it out. By the time we see him in ""Winter Soldier,"" it's understood that the man has been through hell. Losing an eye to a cat is not necessarily what I had in mind. (I know the cat was actually a pretty horrific alien -- but he was scratched while trying to get cuddly in it.)nnBen Mendelsohn's performance was also noteworthy, and I really like the ambiguity surrounding the Skrulls' storyline. That was one of the few redeeming moments of the film and I'm looking forward to them in future Marvel films.nnGoose seemed pretty unnecessary. Comedic? Sure. But Goose's motivations seemed questionable when moving about in the movie. Specifically, why was Goose following Danvers and Fury around -- even onto the prototype Quinjet? And why was Goose on Earth to begin with? At any rate -- Goose seemed to be forced into the movie for one major purpose: to get Fury, etc. out of a pinch. The lead up to that was a bit of a mess. And -- again -- the cat scratch was underwhelming.nnAt the end of the day, ""Captain Marvel"" seemed very unnecessary. I wasn't crazy about Larson's performance, and I wasn't crazy about Carol Danvers either, especially since they shortchanged her personal story so much. Personally, I think a better re-write of this film would have been if they went in chronological order with the crash taking place in the first 20 minutes. You could've inserted plenty of feminine themes leading up to that moment giving the audience time to absorb it and identify with her.nnI recommend waiting for it on Blu-Ray. There's nothing compelling about this film that requires you to see if before Endgame.",negative
"This was a film that I was excited to see when we got that end scene in Avengers Infinity War. In seeing the first trailer, my anticipated excitement went from very high to bland and disappointed. I came in really wanting to like this movie, but it just didn't work for me. The main character fell flat. They were not likeable, or come off in any way that would be relatable to the audience. There was nothing special about this one at all. This is a movie you could do without to go see Endgame. The answered question about what happened to Fury's eye was also a huge letdown.",negative

"A comedy that worked surprisingly well was the little British effort ""The Divorce Of Lady X (1938)"" . It marks the first pairing of Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon, before that little film about uncontrollable passion on the 19th century English moors. And while Olivier and Oberon are not particularly well-suited to screwball comedy, it all flows along nicely. Oberon is Leslie, a young woman who ends up in priggish divorce lawyer Logan's (Olivier) hotel suite by way of a nasty English fog preventing travel. She does everything possible to irritate him--but, in the crazy way films go, he falls for her. And she falls for him. But a serious case of mistaken identity occurs when Oberon's ""Lady X"" (that's all she leaves Oliver in a note) is thought by Olivier to be a married woman. To make matters worse, and more amusing, Lord Mere (Ralph Richardson) goes to Olivier wanting a divorce from his wife whom dear Larry thinks must be Oberon! There is some nice battle-of-the-sexes dialogue, and fun exploration of sexual politics. You can see that Olivier is not too confident with the comedy, but in true Olivier he's a consummate professional, and delivers. And he handles the screwball twists and turns, maybe not with ease, but with gusto. Oberon was no great shakes as an actress, but she was usually competent enough, and despite their reputed off-screen dislike of her, worked well with Olivier. This was filmed in early Technicolour that looks very primitive today (everyone looks even whiter than Michael Jackson), but perhaps the print needs cleaning up.",positive
"'Blade' would be an extremely above-average comic-book, vampire-hunter action/horror if it weren't for two minor flaws. #1 I loved seeing the all-but invincible Blade/Snipes do his slicing and dicing, but the whole ""Yes!"" fist/punch was literally a letdown. #2 Bad, no make that horrible, CGI  even for 1998 standards. This is mainly in the last third, but some sprinkled throughout. Okay, despite those minor infractions, I really enjoyed this movie. All actors did a suburb job and the fact that this now looks like yet another 'Matrix' rip-off is hilarious considering this came out one year prior. So maybe 'The Matrix' copied 'Blade.' At any rate, it's a very movie for multiple genre-loving audiences: Comic Book geeks, action fanatics and horror/vampire lovers. So, we have Blade, half-man/half-vampire, or ""day-walker"" and his accomplish, Whisler (a la ""Batman and Alfred"") battling the undead who, apparently almost out number humans. Who knew? In a rare act of humanity (Blade's more of an antihero) our sword ninja/vamp rescues a newly infected (coincidentally) blood specialist/doctor. Meanwhile, trouble brews amongst the vampires as one wants (you guessed it) supreme power and needs Blade somehow to obtain it. It's not the most original concept, if you read what I just wrote, but still highly enjoyable. You will want to see Blade succeed, you will root for him despite his imperfections and mannerisms. And you will know what's coming as this is the typical act 1-2-3 of a comic book introduction movie. Still, watch this without trying to go too deep. Such as Vampire SPF-1000 ""suntan lotion""? Really? What about the scalp? Wouldn't that still burn? Just like the money they burn for weapons? Uh, okay, I am going too deep. Once again, sit back and enjoy the techno-charged fun ride.",positive

Whether it's Sinatra, who obviously would have bumped up against this type of character growing up in Hoboken and working in numerous bands, or Preminger, who uses the soundtrack and the Frankie-Zosch subtext to slip the addict's interior worldview past the Hays Code cage, you get a good companion piece to On the Waterfront, which was filmed almost exactly the same time.

"At times I really wonder when I look at the comments here it seems as if most people have seen a completely different film than I have. I've just seen it... and liked it. Not in the way, that it made me happy, but in the way of having seen a good film!<br /><br />The film needs some patience, yes. And yes, the main character is REALLY annoying, but that I'm sure is by intention.<br /><br />Maybe it really makes a difference if you watch this film in a cinema or at home. Most people watch films at home like they are listening to elevator music. This movie definitely doesn't fit as background noise.<br /><br />And no. Good directing doesn't mean having five laughs or explosions a second. Good directing means following your subject and keeping the story and actors together. And while that doesn't work out perfectly, at least I think it works quite good.<br /><br />I liked the photography and sets, even if they brink on the surreal at times. The opening scene is really special.<br /><br />I also liked the acting  Guillaume Depardieu is NOT playing Pierre. He is acting the role of a Pierre who is himself playing a role! Pierre is not the romantic hero that he so hard tries to be, he is a presumptuous and self-righteous idiot, a downright weakling who by and by harms all the people he claims to protect. That even his love for truth is simply a pose is beautifully demonstrated by his ongoing lying and not even once asking questions or explaining himself.<br /><br />People are wondering where this or that person came from and other stuff: No character who is seen for more than two scenes is left unexplained, there is enough information scattered throughout the film on everyone.<br /><br />And even the strange building begins to make sense as soon as the target practicing is seen: Remember that Isabelle fled from a war zone - and obviously this is a refuge for fighters in a civil war, most likely Bosnia (which was still going on, when the film was produced). At least that's what is hinted at by the story Isabelle tells Pierre when she first meets him and by the later scene where Pierre shows Isabelle the book with his father on the cover, which is surrounded by books on Bosnia.",positive
"L'Humanité is a murder mystery. These movies tend to be popular,<br /><br />and the 6.9 rating it currently has suggests that it has been, too.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.<br /><br />A few non-spoilers, for instance, include a 5-minute scene<br /><br />wherein the main character eats an apple. And another 3 minutes<br /><br />where he breathes.<br /><br />In case you were wondering, this is not, in fact, art. Neither is it a<br /><br />commentary on humanity, which from the title it seems it is trying<br /><br />to be. It is, in fact, boring. There are numerous attempts in this<br /><br />movie to say something about humanity. One might think to<br /><br />onesself, ""How would I comment on humanity?"" And the most<br /><br />obvious and boring answers will of course be sex, love, and death.<br /><br />Not that these options are uninteresting when done well - just that<br /><br />they are the canonical options. For sex, this movie does its best to<br /><br />make it unattractive and disgusting. In your first five minutes -<br /><br />hence this is not a spoiler - you will see the bloodied vagina of a<br /><br />murdered 11-year-old girl; it's a murder mystery, remember?

"Fans of creature feature films have to endure a lot of awful movies lately. Blood Surf shamelessly joins the list of stupid, redundant pulp-horror titles about ridiculously big animals that want to turn the food chain upside down. Crocodiles are particularly successful as we already had to struggle our way through the abysmal 'Crocodile' (directed by a disappointing Tobe Hooper) and 'Lake Placid'. Blood Surf is every bit as bad as these other films and  on top of that  it likes to exaggerate tremendously. The saltwater-crocodile supposedly is 90 years old, over 30 ft long (!) and it kills for fun! During the film, he amuses himself by devouring a bunch of utterly stupid surfer-dudes & dudettes who came to seek new thrills by surfing in a shark-congested area. The only beautiful aspect about this film is the tropical location. Even though it's a completely inappropriate setting for a film like this, the lagoons and nature looks marvelous. Every other aspect is simply disastrous. There's a quite a bit of gore but it all looks fake and laughable. The dialogues are downright painful to listen to! You won't believe some of the lines these actors have to say! I know surfers are supposed to be a mentally underdeveloped group but I hope for their own sake they're not that stupid! Early in the film, one of the characters refers to Jaws as being a 'mechanical toy' but the croc here looks at least 10 times less real than Spielberg's great white shark. The visual effects in 'Blood Surf' are amateurish and the massacres fail to impress. I won't say too much about the acting since it's secondary in flicks like this. The girls look sexy in wet shirts and their boobs joyfully bounce while running away from the beast. You guessed right: Blood Surf is a very bad film. So bad it becomes fun again.

If you like comic movies, you'll like this one; even if only to complain about it. Recommending a watch prior to End Game!",positive
"Great addition to the Marvel canon. Brie Larson was fun and high energy and made the high powered Captain seem human and relatable .

"Honestly it wasn't a bad movie. now remember that i said that because I'm going to go over this movie with a comb. okay so this movie starts of okay but nothing really happened and it was a bunch of oh whats this and oh whats that it often times felt extremely boring so much so that i had to go to this movie 3 times before i even remembered what happened at the beginning. but the film does this thing were the main character has amnesia but it just doesn't really work with this movie because it honestly didn't affect this movie that movie that much at all. okay another thing you'll forget about is this weird little thing on the map characters neck that i guess hold all her powers back but it really felt like she could d all the same stuff once it was off so that felt a little pointless, Oh and i have no idea why the skulls were good guys it not a bad change it really does change these kind of boring characters into a bit more of a interesting type of species. but we don't really get much from them so again not really huge at all. also the main character has absolutely no emotion at all and it is really bothersome and annoying when the MAIN character has nothing to offer emotionally. I can tell you right now the only part you'll really like about this film is Nick Fury he is honestly the only reason this movie is three and a half stars every thing else in this movie was either way to bland like the sub characters or way to emotionless like the main character. one last thing alien cat is the best thing ever and i need a figure of it immediately.",negative
So disappointing. After the first 20 min I started to realize this movie wasn't going anywhere. By the end I couldn't even depend on action scenes to carry me through. I wanted it to be good and end the end I was so bored. May be at the bottom of my list for marvel movies.,negative
"Rollerskating vampires?! I'm sorry but even for the 80's that's just way too cheesy to be remotely scary... You can excuse the original the odd kitsch moment because it was parodying old movies and TV shows, but that's been done once, so the sequel needed to be a little less camp, not even more outlandish! Plus, the first movie had the presence of Chris Sarandon - a man who could even make stalking discotheques in casual knitwear seem seductive! - that this one sorely lacks, so there was no 'danger' in anything that happened, it just seemed silly.<br /><br />Admittedly I only saw this once when I was 7, but by then already being a huge fan of the original I remember being disgusted. To me, there is no sequel to Fright Night, just a tacky spoof that doesn't deserve any appraisal whatsoever.",negative
"Haters are going to hate, I guess.nThis certainly isn't the best MCU film but it's solid. nThere are funny parts, emotional parts and a good amount of action and sci-fi to satisfy fans. nIt does drag in the first hour, but a lot of story is established during this time.nThe characters are great, especially Nick Fury and Talos, and Brie Larson does a serviceable job considering this is her first attempt at a film of this genre and style.nCut the woman some slack.nThe film and be choppy at times and some of the plot points, characters, etc., could've used some fleshing out. But overall, this is a fine addition to the MCU, and I have to assume Larson will grow into the Carol Danvers character much like Evans and Hemsworth grew into Cap and Thor.",controversial
"Anyone who could find redeeming value in this piece of crap ought to have their head examined. We have the submissive, heroin-addicted, part-time hooker wife with lacerations all over her body, lacerations received from repeated beatings by an abusive son. Now, she is squirting breast milk all over the kitchen floor, the release so gained somehow akin to Helen Keller placing her hands in running water. We have the husband who starts out by patronizing a prostitute who just happens to be his daughter (she's upset with him because he came too quickly)and ends by murdering his female colleague, having sex with her corpse, and then chopping her up. We have the kid who is relentlessly bullied by his classmates and who comes home and beats his mom. You see, it's all circular. Deep, huh? The only decent moment in this horrendous pile of tripe is when the dad murders his son's tormentors. It's a good thing this turkey was shot on video because otherwise what a waste of expensive film it would be. If that guy who thinks artists ought to be interested in this slop is really serious, no wonder most people think artists are insane. We saw this lousy movie, then put on ""Zero Woman, The Accused.""

As the investigation unfolds, it seems the only likely candidate is the highly decorated Pete (Michael Douglas).

"I've just seen a couple of Episodes of ""Eleventh Hour"", but I must say that they were enough to impress me. This series is just so impressive and interesting... I'm definitely going to follow it.<br /><br />First of all, I must say that the acting is top-notch. Patrick Stewart plays his character - Ian the scientist - believably and coolly, and he makes the audience believe in the character. Other characters, such as Rachel, are also believable, and, although they sometimes are a little cold - due to the way the series is filmed - they're interesting.<br /><br />The stories told by this series are also interesting. For example, one of the episodes I saw was about cloning, and a man who was trying to clone humans. The way the Episode was developed, and how Ian - Stewart - kept following clues and saving people was amazing. In addition, it made you think about ethics and how good or bad could this be.<br /><br />Anyway, I think this is one good TV shows. I just hope it keeps going on like this - interesting, thought-provoking and with good acting. Even though it's filmed in a kind of cold way - little lightning, cold photography, lots of close-ups - it never stops being interesting. Highly recommendable.",positive

I could ignore the plot holes and write it off as one of the more mediocre marvel movies if it weren't for the horrible casting choice of the main character and all of the atrocious ret-coning being done in this movie.

Belushi and Lovitz are so likable and identifiable with the common man that you can't help but get involved once you start watching. The movie has a wonderful cast of stars, some already were big, and others were just getting started. It's billed as a feel good movie, and that's exactly what it is. This movie teaches you that life isn't always so bad after all. Sometimes you've just gotta look at stuff in a different perspective to fully appreciate what you already have. When you're done watching, you'll appreciate the things you have a lot more and you'll also be smiling.

"I saw a screening of this movie last night. I had high expectations going into it, but was definitely disappointed. Within 5 minutes of the opening, Williams is already campaigning for his presidency. And he becomes president in the first 40 minutes. So there goes all that aspect of the movie. The first half hour are hilarious. Don't get me wrong, the movie has its moments. But after the first half hour, it takes a turn for the worst. It becomes less of a comedy, and more of a thriller/drama/love story...which is pointless. the movie goes nowhere and stands still for a good 30 minutes. there are laughs interspersed here and there, but the consistently funny part is in the beginning and only the beginning. at one point, the biggest cheer i heard in the audience is when a person in the crowd yelled 'boooo' during a very confusingly emotional scene. Williams gives a great performance, right on par with his comedic style. Walken also delivers a strong supporting role as only he can. I think the one character that goes underrated is Lewis Black. Consistently vulgar and political, its funny to see him tone it down for a PG-13 rating. Overall, I would not pay to see the movie. Afterall, I saw it for free and even I was disappointed. The first half hour is solid, and its all downhill from there. Not really fitting into a category, the movie realizes half way through that it should not have been anything more than a one-hour comedy central special. 4.5/10",negative
I feel that captain marvel was a good movie not as an action movie but as a good story it answered questions few were asking this is the weakest film I think so far,positive
"When Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) sent that message for an adapted pager seconds after Thanos' snap, the expectation went up there. After all, almost a year ago we were awaiting the arrival of Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) as the potential heroine who would save the day in a universe that is in a lot of trouble and that was 50% decimated by the villain.nnAnd perhaps the biggest problem of ""Captain Marvel"" is that expectation generated. Ally, too, to other factors. For example, the threshold that some Marvel films have hit a few years ago. The work of director Anna Boden and director Ryan Fleck unfortunately can not be placed on the same shelf of films as ""Black Panther"" (2018), ""Avengers: Infinite War"" (2018), ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016) and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014), only to stay in some films of phases 2 and 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Nor is it better than ""Wonder Woman"" (2017), just to compare it with the best DC has created in recent years.nnIn fact, ""Captain Marvel"" is an uninspired movie, its action scenes are far from being among the best ever produced by Marvel and fails to explore important aspects of the narrative around which the heroine was inserted.nnThe question is: Why instead of showing the umpteenth origin story with the same tiresome elements that we have already seen in other films of origin, ""Captain Marvel"" was not straightforward? In the case, the war between Skrulls and Krees, one of the most classic stories in the comics.nnIt is understandable the need to introduce the character. After all, so far, in the movies, Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) had never even been mentioned. But the old bow ""Who am I really? ""Where did I come from?"" ""What's my job in the world?"" ""Why am I doing this?"" ""What are you hiding from me?"" - I finally rediscovered myself"" it seems a tiresome formula that leaves us with the impression that this story could be better told in another way. Or worse, it seems like a lazy movie.nnOf course looking at everything Marvel has built up so far, making the Captain Marvel movie in this format was a well-calculated risk. The studio bet on the late novelty of having a female protagonist in a film of superheroes, while it was overtaken by DC at this point, which launched well before the Wonder WomanĂ‚Â´s movie. And the numbers multiplying every day in the cinemas, show that Marvel, at least from the economic point of view, had made the right decision. We hope she now has the boldness to move on and make the Black WidowĂ‚Â´s movie, so desired since ""The Avengers"" (2012).nnHowever, ""Captain Marvel"" turns out to be a somewhat anodyne film. It has a confusing first part that refers to flashbacks to try to locate who is Carol Danvers, a medium with a long rediscovery and accounts and an end that lacked the figure of a villain who really confronted her while she discovered the full potential of their powers. For a race of warriors, however, the Krees have given up very easily to face it only because it prevents some warheads from reaching the Earth.nnThe impression is that ""Captain Marvel"" served more like a movie like ""Ant-Man and Wasp"" (2018). While it located the viewer where Scott Lang was when Thanos snapped his fingers, it served to give a fairly generalized overview of who Captain Marvel is before the inevitable confrontation with Thanos in ""Avengers: Endgame."" All the best seems to have stayed for an eventual second film. Especially the Kree-Skrull War.nnAbout Brie Larson, the actress seemed to have been a wise choice for the role. She is a good actress who does not have great performance, but has qualities for the development of the character from now on. And the partnership with Samuel L. Jackson worked well in the film. Let's see what it will be like now that she will insert herself into ""Avengers: Endgame"".nnAnother positive point is the soundtrack. As ""Captain Marvel"" takes place in the 90s, the film brought a collection of hits from the decade with songs by Garbage, No Doubt, Nirvana, R.E.M. It was a trip back in time and full of references to the decade, from the Blockbuster network of movie theaters to Tarantino. But some songs seemed a bit out of place. It did not make much sense to ""Come as you are"" while Carol confronted the Supreme Intelligence Kree.nn""Captain Marvel,"" so got owed. It's ok fun, but it looked like the best kept in store for the future.",negative
For DC fans Captain Marvel will obviously be Bad. Marvel fans will love it because movie do contains emotions action comedy everything it's a good movie.

"Not a bad movie, but perhaps was hamstrung by the impending release of Avengers: Endgame. Felt like a movie made purely to satiate the fan base thirsty for the conclusion of the Avengers Series, instead of a stand-alone flick. The alternating timelines were confusing to follow, and the battle scenes weren't all that good. Brie Larson did a fine job acting her role, as did Hollywood veteran Nick Fury, but overall it was just a Ă˘fineĂ˘? movie.",negative
"This movie was really bad. First they didn't even follow the facts for it. Half of the movie was made up and it was more about the deputy whose mother was one of Ed Gein's victims. The acting was horrible, except for the guy playing Ed Gein, but its not hard to mess up playing a weird guy. though i think it was horrible i gave it a three because they started it off with actual crime photos. that was the best part of the movie. As soon as the introduction of the movie was finished the movie went downhill. The writer of this movie tried to spice it up, but it didn't need to be. The story of Ed Gein is interesting enough without falsifying information.",negative
"Regret going to the theater for this movie. Poorly directed and produced. They made this movie just like a quick blurt to introduce Captain Marvel to the End Game movie next month. The climax of the movie was so poorly built that the climax is barely recognizable.

You won't be disappointed.",positive
"Overall an ok movie but doesn't meet the high standards already set by Marvel. nBrie Larson was ok. She started actually being engaging during her training phase alongside Jude Law. She started with charasmatic performance with humour, but this performance turned very wooden very quickly. nSamuel L. Jackson was the best performer by far, but this movies plot/writing has ruined his character. Fury was the 'head honcho' of Shield and Avengers who had presence and weight, but here he is portrayed as being inspired by Captain Marvel even tho she didn't earn that level of adoration whatsoever. Also, how Fury lost his eye was pathetic and disrespectful to his character. He is shown cowaring holding a cat during a gunfight which annoyed me because it's just not a true representation of Nick Fury at all.nnCaptain Marvel / Carol Danvers, although showing potential at first, shown zero character development or significant arc, she remains unjustly cocky throughout and unengaging for most of movie and ridiculously overpowered for no real reason other than she 'absorbed' an explosion and inherited these powers for no logical reason.nnMCU plot holes annoyed me too. The Tesaract had already being established as being with Shield, so why does the scientist woman have it to experiment with ??? Makes no sense and disrespects the stories of previous MCU movies.nn      Overall a decent movie, fantastic CGI with de-aging effects but deffinetly not rewatching or buying on Blu-Ray.",negative
"In August Days/Dies d'agost Marc Recha has given us a sun-saturated Catalan documentary-style road movie that's mostly a meandering improvised meditation on brotherhood and reclaiming the dead. The beautiful sometimes large-scale, richly atmospheric 35 mm. landscape images, nice soundtrack and Catalan-language narration are enchanting as a mood piece, if one is content with a trajectory that hasn't much momentum and doesn't lead anywhere in particular. Filmmaker Marc Recha and his non-identical twin David are the stars and the narrative is voiced by their younger sister. Marc had been researching the life of Ramon Barnils (1940-2001), a socialist editor who had been a family friend. He felt he was saturated with information and had to take a break. The break turned into making this film, which seeks to capture the mood of the interviews with Barnils' associates, thoughts about the Spanish Civil War, the drought season they were experiencing, the rugged landscape, the Recha brothers' affection for each other, swims and suntanned nudity and whatever characters or stories they ran into as they camped out of their van. This leads to pursuit of a giant catfish and the temporary disappearance of one of the brothers. In the end David has to go back to Barcelona to be with his daughter and Marc has to return to his project, and there it ends. I found it fascinating to listen to an extended narration in the Catalan language with its blend of Spanish and French-sounding words (perhaps linked with Provençal?). This isn't a major film but it commands attention and makes sense as a film festival choice with its clean visual and auditory beauty and its way of playing around with genres and blending autobiography with fiction and documentary in a fresh and thought-provoking way.<br /><br />An official selection of the 2006 New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center.",positive
"Young spinster, who doesn't associate with women her own age and is eyed by gentleman from the retirement set, invites an apparently mute young man into her apartment on a rainy day. Nervous and overly-polite to hide her own sexual insecurities, she is most pleased when the boy makes himself to home in her guest bedroom...but not so happy when he begins sneaking out the window at night. Sandy Dennis is not a hapless actress, but why she was attracted to these sad-sack roles I guess we'll never know. Based on a book by Richard Miles, and about as far removed from a commercial drama as one could get, this lurid material not only attracted Dennis but also director Robert Altman (whose work is static, at best). The narrative seems almost a sex-reversal of ""The Collector"", a tag which may have sold the film-rights but which doesn't turn out to be a good idea cinematically. Even the film's best sequence (Dennis shopping for a prostitute to satisfy her prisoner) doesn't quite come off, with Sandy acting both ill and indignant (whose idea was this plan?). Michael Burns is quite good as the kid who uses this frumpy, pasty-sick woman just for her comfy digs, but he's handled too bashfully by Altman, with lots of strategically-placed towels and flesh-colored undies (Altman clearly wasn't ready for a mature picture with adult themes at this point). Sandy Dennis has a handful of very good scenes; she doesn't chatter away mindlessly here, she thinks before she speaks and she's alarmingly careful in her actions. Unfortunately, the role itself is a bummer, with an apparent slide into mental deterioration which seems to happen off-screen. As such, the abrupt finale is maddening, and the overall results tepid. *1/2 from ****",negative
"Arg. The shuffling dinosaurs are back to take another bite out of our sanity in this all-awful third film. This time, European terrorists(Irish I'd say) hi-jack an army convoy supposed to be transporting uranium. They pull into a shipyard, open the truck and discover our old friends the carnosaurs. Pandemonium comes visiting then when the rubber dinos chomp the terrorists, the cops and some marines. The whole film seems to be (again) largely inspired from Alien(as Carnosaur 2 was) with the pathetic marines going through the ""claustrophobic"" shipyard? guns at the ready. This third opus is probably the driest and ungoriest film of the lot, with only one spurt of blood when a rubber dino rips a marine's head off. The dinos are stiff, shuffling creatures as usual and the T-Rex sounds like an enraged elephant when it roars(it also appears to have no eyes). One of the goofiest scenes of the film is when the coppers arrive on the scene: they enter the building where the hijacked truck is kept and hear some weird noise coming from another truck. On opening it, surprise! The Rubber Reptile Gang burst out and devour them. Why were the dinos locked up in the second truck after escaping from the first? How did they get locked in as the truck door could only be locked from the outside? What was the point of filming this scene???? Oh bother, who cares?

"Captain Marvel was a really good movie. I know its getting alot of hate but i think it was really enjoyable. The action and cinematography was actually really decent and waa much bettee than i thought it would be. The supporting chatacters were great most specifucally Nick Fury of course and Maria Rambaue was a great actress. Carol herself was suprisingly more expressive and charismatic than i thought she was going to be (the trailers did not do this movie justice i'll just say that). However she still lacked any definitive character traits and when she wasnt around characters like Nick Fury, Rambaue, or Talos she was kinda bland. However i dont thibk that Brie was a bad choice for her Brie could have done alot better and i hope she does in Endgame. Some other cons is the first part of the film, there were cool moments but it was kinda slow and didnt make me super inteteseted until she got on earth. The ending was also kinda underwhelming and i kinda expected more to happen between Yon Rogg and Carol like i thought somehow he would try to make her get so angry that she couldnt attack him properly but i guess thats just how i feel personally. Also Jude Law was sorta dissapointing as Yon Rogg, and i really didnt get what his personal motive was besides the fact that he was just a evil Kree, but Jude Law acted really well as him so it made his character a lil better. So yeah overall Captain Marvel was great and exciting despite some flaws with tge story and characters its stll on the list as one of the good MCU movies.",positive

"I just got the DVD for Hardware Wars, in a shiny new package, looking irresistable. Stuck it in my DVD player to find a slew of extra fun stuff. The extra content on the DVD is even longer than the movie. For those of you that have (shame!) never seen Hardware Wars, it one fantastically silly Star Wars spoof (of Episode IV, of course). Household appliances (such as irons, toasters, vacuums, and a waffle maker) stand in for Ty-fighters, X-wings, R2D2, and the death star. Instead of Princess Leia, we have Princess Ann-Droid, complete with Cinnabon hairdo. You get the point, I'm sure. Mad silliness, and a fun ride for any Star Wars geek (like me!)<br /><br />Now, the DVD - wow! A director's commentary where he basically goes off on the movie, making fun of himself and the project throughout.

"I saw this movie in Blockbuster and thought it might be a good Sunday evening movie when there is nothing else to do. So I bought it used, 3 DVDs for $25. Although it was cheap, my money would have been better spent on a nail to drive through my foot.<br /><br />The film started out nicely. Kinda Dark and mysterious. I was always enthralled with vampire and samurai movies as a kid. I thought the combo would be really cool. The first fight scene was pretty cool. I was excited for the rest of the movie. Then the movie took a serious nose dive.<br /><br />I understand that this was a big hit in the east. I guess because of the twins. I don't see it though. This movie, aside from the first 10 minutes, was absolutely horrible. So many movies in this genre have the potential to be great, and blow it terribly.

He probably made a few bucks off it though.<br /><br />The only cool thing in this movie are the swords they use. Nice idea.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.",negative

"Great movie! Most of the negative reviews can be completely ignored. Larson did a great job with the role. She understandably wasn't overly dramatic. Was a little overwhelming at first & hard to follow, but it worked out nicely. Pacing throughout the movie wasn't always great but had it's ups and downs. Any Marvel fan knows how op CPT Marvel is so it can hardly be a complaint that the antagonist wasn't strong enough. The movie had humor, nice costumes/special effects, good action scenes, slightly predictable but also great plot, and is overall a great movie for any Marvel fan or even people who haven't kept up with the MCU.",positive

"When it comes to movies, I am generally easily entertained and not very critical, but must say that this movie was one big flop from the start. I gave it 30 minutes and then rewound it.

"This wasn't a good movie.  The story was bad and boring.  The lead is a very shallow actor.  It tried too hard to do something other than be a super hero movie, and lost itself somewhere.

"First off, I would like to point out that the reason why I gave this movie 1 star out of 10 is because there is no option to give it NO stars! it really is that bad! I was never eager to see this film after I saw the ads for it, I ended up seeing it only by chance because some friends of mine had tickets and had one spare so I tagged along. Before seeing it I had a fairly good idea that it wouldn't be genius - the premise seemed far too silly and stupid for anything good to come out of it, but at the back of my mind I was thinking ""but there must be something good about it for UMA THURMAN and Luke Wilson do to the film..."" not that I think either of them are particularly terrific but they are big-named stars who would normally only do films that would enhance their reputations. However, about 10-20 minutes into the feature I realized that the movie was probably worse than I had at first anticipated. I was shocked at how terrible the script was. It really gave the actors NOTHING to work with, so much so that they really looked like they didn't know what they were doing (especially Luke Wilson). The story was completely predictable - if you've seen the ad then you've pretty much seen the movie! And there was nothing original about it - it pretty much borrows from every 'super-hero' story that has ever been which would be acceptable had the film been set up as a satire of that genre, but alas it wasn't. The direction seemed to be of realism. I got the feeling that the director wanted the film to feel completely realistic and not satire at all, and yet there were some moments in the film that were so unbelievably unrealistic that it would have worked if it were a satire. At one moment in the movie two of the characters seem to die and one of the surviving characters has a line like ""Oh well, she's dead...time to move on"" and he says it in such a droll voice that it completely didn't make any sense. I found myself checking my watch after about 40 minutes to see how much longer I would have to sit through it. And then it struck me...I began to think ""I wonder if the studio have made this picture as a test to see if they can make the worst possible movie ever made, and still pull a large audience..."" I couldn't think of any other reason why this film would be made. For movies to be made these days, the script goes to a massive screening process and very very few scripts actually make it to the production stage...I can't comprehend how this one got past the first draft stage... By the end, and exceedingly, dumb-founding-Ly stupid climax, I was laughing heartily - just not at what the film-makers wanted me to laugh at, but instead at how ridiculous and stupid the movie was. Thank God I didn't have to pay money to see it...because that would have really annoyed me!!! Oh, and could I just add, that of the two Wilson brothers, I have always preferred Luke because I think he is a better, more versatile actor...but if he wants to step even further into OWEN's shadow then this is exactly the way to do it...I doubt that he will get many more job offers after this crappy waste of 2 hours!!! and remember, it only got a generous 1/10 because I couldn't select 0!",negative
"""ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ""! If IMDb would allow one-word reviews, that's what mine would be. This film was originally intended only for kids and it would seem to be very tough going for adults or older kids to watch the film. The singing, the story, everything is dull and washed out--just like this public domain print. Like other comedy team films with roots in traditional kids stories (such as the awful SNOW WHITE AND THE THREE STOOGES and the overrated BABES IN TOYLAND), this movie has limited appeal and just doesn't age well. Now that I think about it, I seriously doubt that many kids nowadays would even find this film enjoyable! So my advice is DON'T watch this film. If you MUST watch an Abbott and Costello film, almost any other one of their films (except for A&C GO TO MARS) would be an improvement.",negative
"What ever possessed Martin Scorcese to remake this film? And not only did he remake it, completely ruin it? The nonsensical decision to make the character played by Robert DeNiro (in his most overdone performance, and that's saying a lot) into a religious fanatic is ridiculous, and exemplary of attitudes harbored by Hollywood (and Mr. Scorcese especially)- attitudes that compel writers to think that the best way to make a character insane is to tattoo a crucifix on his back. In any case, this movie is awful. <br /><br />",negative

"Most war films made in the US during WWII were great fun to watch but suffered from severe gaps in realism because they were being produced more for propaganda value to raise the spirits at home than anything else. I am not knocking these films as many of them are still very watchable. However, because they so often lack realism they are prevented from being truly great films. A perfect example was the John Garfield film Air Force--in which a B-17 nearly single-handedly takes out half the Japanese air force! However, Pride Of The Marines is a welcome departure--scoring high marks for portraying a true story in a reasonably accurate manner. When I first saw this film, I thought it was NOT a true story as it seemed way too improbable to be true. However, after researching further I found that it was in fact rather true to the amazing story of two men who did so much to earn the Medal of Honor. This is one case where real life seemed too incredible to be true!",positive

"Three words: Piece of Art. This film is just great. It's beautiful, sad, frightening and thought-provoking at the same time. The score constantly stays in my head, the acting is wonderful the scenery scary and beautiful at the same time.<br /><br />It was more by chance than on purpose that I saw this movie. At the time I decided to watch this movie I was just bored and read lists of Asian films, which maybe good. Well, I saw the title ""A tale of two sisters"" which sounded very interesting. Then I read the summary of the plot and decided ""You don't just watch this film, you've gotta buy it"". Said, done. I bought this film and was hooked from the very first minute.<br /><br />The plot kept me interested from the beginning till the end; the twist near the end of the film made me scream. I really didn't see something like this coming. And the ending scene made me cry...it just made me cry. It was so sad.<br /><br />Well, I recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a film that combines an interesting plot, with scary scenes and atmosphere. Although you should be aware of the fact that the ending is, as I mentioned before, a very sad one. But this just fits in the mood of the film, doesn't it?",positive
"Jean Paget, Joe Harman, and Noel Strachan--all are unlikely heroes and survivors.

Her good humor and hardiness inspire everyone around her, and those with the courage to go in with her are rewarded. The beautiful scenery and musical score adds to the adventure. Despite the length it was never boring to me. These ordinary people did extraordinary things and it is based on a true story. Someone borrowed my VHS a few years ago and I never saw it or them again.

I saw the movie twice at the IMAX and I liked it both times without getting bored.Even if it played at smaller scope then some might have expected I was more able to relate to the character of Captain Marvel which felt more down to earth like many other superhero charaters.Except having a loss of memory she wasn't plagued by insecurities or fear of what she has become and hardly had any problems getting along with her powers and using them which was refreshing to me.,positive

"Herbet Clutter, wife Bonnie, and their teenage children Kenyon and Nancy were much liked and respected in their tiny town of Holcomb, Kansas--but in the early hours of 14 November 1959 all four were brutally murdered. Rather unexpectedly, the crime made an impression on author Truman Capote, who rushed to the scene and followed the course of the case to its conclusion. The result was the book IN COLD BLOOD. Controversial, shocking, and exceptionally well-written, it became an international best seller and it remains a touchstone for crime writers to this day.<br /><br />The 1967 film version of Capote's work is almost as remarkable as the book itself. Filmed in black and white in many of the real-life locations, it has a slightly documentary quality, icy and detached--and the overall cast is exceptional. This is the film on which Robert Blake's reputation as an actor rests, and deservedly so. As killer Perry Smith, Blake traps you between a profound distaste and the shock of unexpected sympathy; it is a masterful performance from start to finish. As Richard Hickock, Scott Wilson is no less fine.<br /><br />Like Capote's book, the film opens with Smith and Hickock as they travel to Kansas and brings them to the Clutter home--only to suddenly flash past the crime to detail the investigation that finally resulted in their arrest and conviction. The centerpiece of the film has always been the moment at which we at last see what occurred in the Clutter home; actually filmed in the Clutter house itself, it is a spinechilling sequence, horrific and deeply disturbing.<br /><br />Director and writer Richard Brooks guides the film with a very powerful sense of deliberation, erring only in the sense that he allows the film to become slightly preachy. Given the overall power of the film, however, this becomes a trivial annoyance. Strong stuff--and recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer",positive

"As other viewers have mentioned, this film was an interesting experiment in photography. The colors are comic book bold. I think the director got carried away with his ""artistic vision"" over the look of the film instead o badly needed attention to content. Despite its stellar cast, the performances are lackluster and the story nearly incoherent. Madonna was likely cast purely as a stunt to get pre-release press. A good thing as her appearance here lent some credence to her album ""I'm Breathless (Music inspired by the film Dick Tracy)"" which was a stratospheric hit (due in large part to the inclusion of dance-hit ""Vogue"" - which is not in, nor has the slightest relation to this film). I'd guess the major portion of money from this film came from tie-ins to Madonna's ""I'm Breathless"" album.<br /><br />If you watch it at home, by end-titles, you'll think ""there's two hours out of my life I'd like to have back.""

"This (extremely)low-budget movie is compared to the great classic ""Silent Night Deadly Night"", since it is labeled as a Slasher Flick. First let me say that I think that even ""Silent Night Part 2"" is better than this (that one was filled with flashbacks of the original for more than half of the movie). ""Christmas Evil"" tries to get psychological by introducing the main character as someone who goes insane,(a strong word), slowly (very slowly). He is irritated by people who do not get the true meaning of Christmas and at work he can't stand how the fabricated toys are made with such lack of quality and love. Dressed up as Santa he finally goes on a killing spree. Also a strong word, since only 3 people are killed without the real need for special effects. No tension, no thrills, no gore, no cast. For one exception that is: Jeffrey DeMunn is in it. He is best known for playing aside Tom Hanks as one of the guards in the classic ""The Green Mile"". He still must be kicking himself these days for ever accepting the role. He truly is the only one who really can act, his supporting role is better than the main lead. (who also isn't that bad, but if you're overshadowed by a little supporting character, you're not great either.). And what about that strange ending ? (you have to see it, to believe it). ""Christmas Evil"" is downright boring, nothing happens and the artwork is just misleading. This is not a slasher. You wanna see a real Christmas slasher, check out the all time greatest: ""Silent Night, Deadly Night"".",negative
Captain Marvel is portrayed as a one dimensional character with little heart or passion. Does little to support any sort of real feminist virtues as it just is skin deep corporate attempt to cash in.

"Maybe I'm biased because the F-16 is my favorite fighter aircraft - although the F-14 is probably second or third - but I liked this movie. The sequels (Iron Eagle II and III) don't measure up acting and plot wise, but the first one - along with Top Gun - have excellent flying and music, along with reasonable plots and acting. II and III clearly have much less of a ""flight budget"", but their main drawback is plot and acting. I suspect the relative fame and popularity of Iron Eagle compared to Top Gun is almost entirely a reflection of the fame and popularity of Jason Gedrick compared to Tom Cruise.

"Since my third or fourth viewing some time ago, I've abstained from La Maman et la putain while I wait for the DVD. In the meantime, I've read the french screenplay as well as Alain Philippon's monograph on Jean Eustache. The latter ends with a frustrating filmography, eleven films, fiction, doc, and in-between, impossible to see or, in the cases of Mes petites amoureuses and Le Père Noël..., re-see.<br /><br />A few questions that hit me this moment: Polish Véronika's French is plenty colloquial (un maximum d' ""un maximum d'""). Even so, does she have an accent? I think I can tell she does. What does the absence of color add, especially at the single spot the fringe of the city is glimpsed? How does this fringe differ from the sleep and journey that separates worlds of The Tempest and The Winter's Tale? Ditto Alphaville. We may imagine the elapsed years since have done it, but does Eustache deliberately circumscribe the film's milieu? Is this an enchanted isle? Is Alexandre's a fairy tale? Alexandre's always choreographing himself, worrying about how or where to stand or walk, what to say when, announcing these decisions to who have to care less than he does what he does. Or is this his way of trying to choreograph others by doing it to himself? How different is he from Vertigo's Scottie? (I say, I think, very.) What's the difference, and is there one, between Eustache's Léaud, and Truffaut's, and Godard's? How different is the present Léaud? Isn't he still doing it, whatever it is, in recent roles, Irma Vep, Le Pornographe, whatever, approaching old age? Once I arrived early for one in a series of mostly Antoine Doinel (Léaud's character) Truffaut films. For a long while, every three or five minutes, down the aisle would come a twenty-something male in scarf, tweedy coat, Léaud hair, with a direction-seeking nose. I have no idea whether this was conscious or unconscious mimicry. I was that age, but have no idea what I myself looked like then. No scarf, at least. I do have a brother, though, who seems to have learned his carriage from Bresson.",positive
"I will admit that I'm only a college student at this present time, an English major at that. At the time I saw this film I was a high school student--I want to say junior year but it may have been senior, hard to remember. My experience with quantum physics goes pretty much to my honors physics course, an interest in quantum mechanics that has led me to read up on the subject in a number of books on the theoretical aspects of the field as well as any article I can find in Discover and the like. I'm not a PhD by any means.<br /><br />That said...<br /><br />This movie is simply terrible. It's designed to appeal to the scientific mind of the average New Age guru who desperately wants to believe in how special everybody is. My mother is such a person and ever since she's seen this movie she's tried to get all her friends to see it and bought a copy of the film. I attempted to point out the various flaws and problems I'd seen with the films logic and science--and they are numerous--and she dismissed my claims because ""oh, so a high school student knows more than all those people with PhDs."" In this case, apparently so.<br /><br />Leaving behind the fact that earning a PhD doesn't necessarily require that a person be correct or, in fact, intelligent. Leaving behind the fact that my basic understanding of physics is enough to debunk half the film.

"I'd never heard of the Captain Marvel character before, but I wasn't that much into the comics themselves. All I knew about this movie was that the lead actress, Brie Larson had said that people like me - a white male - shouldn't see it and wasn't allowed to have an opinion.  Well, tough luck - I think it was a decent superhero movie. The usual humour that is smattered around the characters in the previous movies seems oddly centred in Samuel L. Jackson and mostly Ben Mendelsohn's characters. I suspect it is because the five (yes five) screenwriters didn't want to risk diluting the strong female Captain marvel/Carol Danvers character, which is a shame.  Another point occurred to me, trying to see emotion in Brie Larson's face, is that she just isn't capable as an actor in shifting modes the way her much more experienced cast are. One of the dangers in putting so much star power on the screen around her is that collectively, Jackson, Mendelsohn, Annette Bennington and Jude Law are so much better at their craft that Larson is left seeming a pale character.nnI left the cinema satisfied with the movie - another solid but unspectaculer Marvel offering. My lingering thought was, why wasn't Lashana Lynch cast as Carol Danvers? I hate woke thinking as lazy and rigid, but everyone (Larson in particular) is so focussed on this as a female power movie, they forgot to think about why she is a blonde white woman when the black mother as a character would have been so much more interesting, and more powerful. That's the danger in trying too hard to be woke - you can never be woke enough to get it right.",controversial
"Captain Marvel is a pretty good movie that truly I was expecting be very good but not this truly wonderful to watch. . I just loved every scene between the Kree and the Skrulls, it was so out of this world to see these two enemies fight in space and on strange planets as they fight each other on planets. Talos (Ben Mendelsohn) was definitely a surprise as his character is just amazing in the movie. Captain Marvel is also a warm welcome to the marvel cinematic universe. Brie Larson is captain marvel as she truly is the defined Carol Danvers on the screen. Samuel Jackson is truly at his best as nick fury is truly the nick fury defined by comics. Its the duo that truly rocks on screen as they are simply amazing to watch together on screen. The score by Pinar Toprak is amazing to listen to form start to finish. Captain marvel has many amazing moments of action and wonderful moments of joy that make wonderful nods to her comics. It's a wonderful comic book movie with wonderful acting and a wonderful soundtrack and a wonderful heroine that will be a welcome new heroine for the next era of marvel movies.",positive
"This is an absolutely true and faithful adaptation of 'The Hollow'. It could be argued that the actual mystery here is not one Christie's best but what makes 'The Hollow' special is the characterisation and I found the actors here, more or less without exception, were perfect in their parts. In such a uniformly good cast it's difficult to select stand out performances but I have to say that Sarah Miles is just perfect as Lucy Angkatell. What is extraordinary is that she not only conveys Lucy's dottiness, tactlessness and her more lovable qualities BUT she also manages to pull off the underlying truth that in fact, Lucy is not really all that nice! Megan Dodds is also very good as Henrietta and Claire Price very affecting as Gerda. John Christow is really quite an unlikeable character but Jonathan Cake nevertheless manages to make us see what his women see in him.<br /><br />As I said, the script follows the story quite faithfully. The only disconcerting thing I found was that Midge and Edward's relationship really comes out of nowhere and I do believe that some of it must have ended up on the cutting room floor! Theirs a secondary story however and the primary story is very well done.

Well, if it wasn't for Halloween, those characters wouldn't have haunted our dreams when we were children.<br /><br />Halloween's director, John Carpenter, got a lot out of the horror movies of the '50s and combined everything he knew into one film that scared the hell out of a lot of people back in the late '70s. This films solidified him as a director to watch and also jump started the career of Jamie Lee Curtis, who plays the girl being stalked by the masked killer.<br /><br />This film may seem cliché today, but back then there wasn't much out there like this. It's been copied from and ripped off of, but Halloween will always remain the quintessential teenage horror movie.

Amanda appears just from nowhere and suddenly has a significant part to play (I won't reveal it in case anyone hasn't read the series). Other illogical parts feature. I really really want Cloud 10 to make a good Left Behind film but sadly this is similar in all the bad ways to the first 2.",negative
"The movie went too far from the source material to the point where it felt like a completely different character.Then Brie Larson is real uninteresting,boring and overall is not a good superhero.It wants to be a strong women's empowerment movie but falls so short when the movie does things like change the original Captain Marvel to a women because the movie is a big feminist fan service movie.At the end of the day the movie is saved because of the always good acting of Samuel Jackson and Clark Gregg as Nick Fury and Agent Coulson  with the help of the rest of the cast except Brie Larson.",controversial
"Like its near contemporaries ""The Great Race"" and ""Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines"", I always associate this film with my childhood especially at New Year. On New Year's Day we'd visit my granny and after lunch, while the adults talked, the kids would watch TV where invariably one of these three crazy race films would be on.<br /><br />For that reason alone, I really wanted to mark ""Monte Carlo Or Bust"" well but I fear I can't, the child not being father to the man on this occasion. By which I mean I can see all too clearly its faults and while I was tempted to smile occasionally, in truth I really wanted all the competitors to get to the end of the race long before they actually do.<br /><br />Of course it's dated by its stereotyping of nationalities and woman as the weaker sex and I also didn't much care for one or two stray, admittedly mild vulgarities which occasionally surfaced. More than that though, the cast, despite hamming it up outrageously just don't sell the film enough. Tony Curtis, in a trial run for his ""Yank Abroad"" turn in the TV series ""The Persuaders"", seems too old to be playing the young gallant, Terry Thomas just isn't dastardly enough, Eric Sykes is unbelievable as a dirty-minded Lothario while Gert Frobe as an overdone Teuton, is just weird doing camp comedy when you remember he was Bond's best villain Goldfinger. If anything the Englishers come off best - Susan Hampshire is at least engaging as a ""bright young thing"", suitably gamine as a posh flapper and although chained to the leash of the script Pete and Dud offer the most amusement as stiff upper lip army types, although even then the ""Carry On"" team did this so much better in ""Carry On Up The Khyber Pass"".<br /><br />Director Annakin tries everything to evoke the ""Golden Silents"", with lashings of slapstick, mistaken identity capers, speeded up camera shots, would-be dramatic stunts and some light romance, but there's no real tension for such a famous race and anyway the race-off at the end seems like another swizz.<br /><br />Actually I'd have given it another mark if they'd stuck to the alternative title ""Those Magnificent Men in Their Jaunty Jalopies"" but in truth the animated series ""Wacky Races"" did this so much better.",negative

There was really only one part I didnt really care for and the CGI looked bad in a few scenes but not many. I was surprised by Brie Larson as well, I haven't seen her in much except 21 Jump Street and Scott Pilgirm but I liked her in this, she was funny and joked around but also showed deep emotion, she was also a little cocky at times so I could see her, Tony, Thor and Star Lord getting into it haha you know after they fix things and I'm sure Star Lord comes back.

"Captain Marvel is by no means a bad movie. But neither is it great. It's awfully mediocre and for most parts forgettable. The action towards the end is good, and the relationship between Carol Danvers and Nick Fury is one of the few saving graces of the movie. But that unfortunately does not make the uncharismatic performances, bad editing, sloppy writing and bland looking movie any better. nnIt works as a family movie and a movie to just shut your brain of and enjoy some action. But if you give it a bit of thought you'll notice how much of a mess it actually is. Unfortunately the movie left me very disappointed, yet the potential for the character is still there, and if they give it a bit more thought maybe in the future we can get a great Captain Marvel.",negative

I love Meatballs! Terrific characters and poignant situations make this one dearly loved. Bill Murray is hysterical and you gotta love that 4-mile trail race at the end! A total classic and one of my favorites now for about 20 years. It brings back fond memories of camp and deals nicely with the experience of being rejected by foolish peers and the empowerment brought one by being rescued by a sympathetic adult. Tons of great one-liners and quite an assortment of wacko counselors. This is the kind of movie where you repeat key phrases among friends for years afterward. Also nothing overtly crude and what a sweet late '70's soundtrack to bring on just the right amount of nostalgia. I can't say enough about Meatballs; it's a classic. Be forewarned! All the sequels are putrid stink bombs that simply bought the name rights for marketing. They have no connection to Ivan Reitman's masterpiece.,positive

"Fun movie. Not groundbreaking but a solid action romp with a good cast and a few twists and turns to make things interesting. There are a couple of details that clearly were missed opportunities and the Nick Fury thing, you know what I'm talking about if you've seen it, definitely was weak. But after the initial sluggish 20-25 minutes of the movie, it lightened up and got its own identity. This movie is optional material for Endgame outside of a great post credits scene which may very well end up being in the final film. So if the trolls and incels that came out in droves to negatively review without even seeing it to the point where it has more reviews than Infinity War somehow make you worry about it, it's okay to wait until home video release. But if you want to enjoy the warming up weather by taking a trip to the movies you (probably) will leave satisfied.",controversial

"Captain Marvel Review: nnI have two reviews, one for general audiences and one for true Marvel Comics Fans (like me).nnParty I : For General Audience:nnI thought it was an entertaining movie. It was in the middle 3rd or bottom of the top 3rd of MCU movies I have seen. I would not say it was as good as Avengers I, Iron Man I, Avengers Civil War, Captain America Winter Soldier, Thor Ragnarok, or Black Panther, but it right after.nnThe FX and action sequences were awesome. It was very cool how they made Nick Fury younger and having Sam Jackson in the movie helped a lot. There was a bit too much Ă˘corny campĂ˘? for my taste, that reminded me at times of Ant Man and Wasp (not good). I thought the story telling was Ă˘okayĂ˘?, not sure a lot of it made sense, but that is true of most comic book-based movies, as they come from print-based action soap operas. MCU has had better movies in that regard though.nnAlthough Carol Danvers/Vers/Captain Marvel was a good character, I would not have cast Brie Larson for this. She looked tough enough, but when she opened her mouth she sound like a girly girl with pretty high voice, not someone who was an Air-force Experimental Jet Pilot or Kree Warrior hearing her talk in some scenes. The Avengers women sound more authoritative and bad ass than her, but she should be far more powerful.nnOther than that I like it and would recommend seeing it in IMAX.nnPart II: For Marvel Comics FansnnFirst and foremost, I know there has been a lot of controversy over some ill-timed statement by Brie Larson. I don't think the film was anti-man or anti-white man. Don't confuse the film with Brie. I think the movie was a pseudo-feminist Ă˘Girl PowerĂ˘? flick, but it was not done for Ă˘cultural propagandaĂ˘?. Hollywood creatives do tend to be very liberal, but people who bankroll these movies are not, they are business people trying to get high return on investment. This is simply their ham-fisted way of trying to compete with Wonder Woman, by introducing some female Ă˘Super ManĂ˘? into the MCU, where none had existed before or in the comics. As we know Mar-vell in the comic was a male Kree warrior, who was a hero in his own right after leaving the Kree. Carol got her powers by accident due to a run in with him. So, they turned Mar-vell into a female scientist, and the person who looked like Carol's mentor was an Ă˘evil maleĂ˘? who lied to her and manipulated her. Yes, these things were done on purpose, I knowĂ˘Â¦to make the story arc around Carol and Ă˘girl powerĂ˘? stronger. nnWe also know Carol was Ms. Marvel and only became Captain Marvel after Mar-vell (the original Captain Marvel) died from cancer. We also know that the Skrulls are not intergalactic Ă˘JewsĂ˘? that whose homeland was destroyed by the Kree Empire (Roman) and they are just innocent refugees looking for a home. We know that Carol Danvers, in the comic is NOT the most powerful character, not even more powerful than the Hulk or Thor, despite the character Recon. And yes, Carol's powers have nothing to do with the Infinity Stones. Both the Kree and the Skrulls are Ă˘badĂ˘? by human standards and a threat to humanity at various points. nnAll I can say is Ă˘this is businessĂ˘? and, also the MCU is not in the same as the main Marvel comic universe, which is the Earth-616 universe. So, the characters can be changed. Also, how many times have characters been reconned and retroconned in the comics? ALL THE TIME. Let's be honest. nnThis is simply a way to compete with Wonder Woman, lets get over it. It's still not a bad flick, it is just jarring to see this many change. I would have advised Marvel to choose another powerful female character, as they exist, but right now the Captain Marvel comic is doing well, so I think they wanted to use that, and not find a character that was less known.nnCaptain Marvel can help introduce other characters like the Silver Surfer and Galactus (which Marvel is still in the process of acquiring the rights to). Yes, Yes, I know Adam Warlock would have been better, and yeah I don't get it eitherĂ˘Â¦but for the fact he is a Ă˘maleĂ˘?, and they wanted a female movie so bad, and no one was excited about a Black Widow movie, and she wouldn't fill this niche in the Infinity War storyĂ˘Â¦soĂ˘Â¦",controversial
"Ben Mendelson is the stand out of the movie as Talo.There are 4 or 5 plot twists that it's space setting,memory wiping and shape shifting cause that you don't see coming.Brie Larson is very funny and sweet while still kickass as Captain Marvel which makes me confused at a lot of reviews I've seen saying she's wooden.Sam Jackson plays a younger Nick Fury before he got all serious mad we get satisfying answers to what lead him to be the way he is in phase 1. All in all a very satisfying movie and the visuals and 90s gags/soundtrack are great too.",negative
"Overall, the movie had it's moments but it wasn't enough to call this a great movie.  It starts slow and just as it's picking up pace it gets a little on the corny MIB side and it takes away from what could have been much more.  The 90's theme was nicely done and Samuel L. Jackson really saved this movie from being a total disappointment.  I felt the mid credit scene was the best part of the entire movie.",positive
"This movie was okay, but probably not one that I would see again. It's definitely the weakest of all the MCU films (except maybe Iron Man 3). This movie was especially disappointing to me as someone who loves both Disney and Marvel, as it just didn't live up to the MCU's usual quality. The movie was sort of boring and the humor was really weak.nnThe movie is supposed to be really empowering for women, which would have been cool if they had done a good job with it. Doing a good job means making a movie with awesome, strong female characters who are likable and well-developed (see Wonder Woman for reference). I say this as a woman, and honestly wish that there were more high quality female-led movies. This was definitely not one of them.nnIf you have to keep verbally reminding me throughout the movie that your main character is strong and a woman, or feel the need to put down others in order to make this point (""Human male: threat low to none""), you clearly are not very confident in your ability to convey a strong female character. I'm not sure if these moments were supposed to be funny, but to me, they just seemed lazy and super cringeworthy. It leaves me wondering if the filmmakers were lazy, bad at their jobs, or just think that moviegoers are stupid and need to be told everything that they should be taking away from the movie.nnWhile this last point really irritates me, I'm giving the movie 1.5 stars because it wasn't totally awful. I was just super disappointed because I expect higher quality from Disney and Marvel, and this was mediocre at best.",negative

"This may not be the very worst movie Peter Sellers ever did (I think that laurel goes to ""The Prisoner of Zenda"") but it is surely the most depressing.

As Fu Manchu, he looks hardly better and spends most of the film (with the exception of those strangely disturbing scenes where he gets jolted with electrical currents) on the verge of collapsing under the weight of all that makeup. The supporting players also look tired and run down, and Sid Caeser's presence is offensive even without his constant references to ""Chinks!"" (One bright spot: this would be one of the last times a major motion picture would portray Asians so insultingly ... or, for that matter, star a non-Asian as one!). The film seems surprisingly cheap, with soupy photography and drab sets - even the whiz-bang Elvis number at the end looks cut-rate. Only the stunning Helen Mirren and the tall, thin, nervous guy who get his pants wet add any sparks of life to this sad affair. All in all, this film provides an eerie premonition of a great comic's death, and an even eerier documentation of his dying.",negative

Captain Marvel does have some decent action scenes, but other ones are lit so dark that I couldn't tell what was going on. Also, some of the editing and choreography in one of fight scenes looked off. It's like they rushed the scene and it just turned out subpar for a marvel movie. I felt the urge to pull out my phone and browse Facebook during certain scenes because I was bored. nnSam Jackson shines in this role. They did a great job making him look just like he did in the 90s. I kept thinking how much he looked like he did in 1998 film The Negotiator. Although some scenes he does look weird in, it's like you can tell they had difficulty doing the deaging in certain scenes.nnBrie Larson felt poorly cast for this role. I liked her in Room, Kong, and The Spectacular Now. But, she didn't feel right for this role. She felt very emotionless and bland.

"Having only seen five episodes of the show before this, (I've been watching the repeats on BBC Two) I haven't really had much experience of the League, but as a fledgling fan as well as a massive fan of British comedy, I can say this film is hilarious. Seeing Herr Lipp, (who I had not seen on screen before the film) Briss and Geoff on the big screen was a great comedy experience. Being on screen is something that the League take full advantage of, with heads blowing up, (it'll come as a surprise who it is) and gruesome murders with random Middle Ages style battles all the way.<br /><br />Geoff is easily the funniest character of the three protagonists in this film, because he has the best one liners and overall behaviour, just like in the series. One of my only disappointments with the film was not hearing Geoff shout ""Well now I've got this gun"" even once, (even though there is a build-up to it in one part of the film.) The film itself overall is, to use the phrase everyone else does, Pythonesque and it's very reminiscent of films like ""Life of Brian."" Appearances from Tubbs and Edward were welcome, but Papa Lazarou's line ""Hello Daves"" cracked me up more than anything said by them, (Lazarou's probably my favourite Vasey character after Tubbs and Edward.) It's got quite a poignant ending with one of the main character being killed off and I can only hope this is not the League's last on-screen Vasey venture. With Gatiss mentioning the possibility of another series or film, I'm now very excited. This is a film I will see again, partly because the projector died towards the end, leaving out 10 minutes or so of the film, but mainly because it's inventive and hilarious. I'm not really bothered if it's not as good as the TV series, because I loved it.<br /><br />One thing though, if you've never seen the League, you'll still love it, but Dave knows what you'll think about the people who make this stuff up. As Tubbs or Edward might put it, it's a local film, for local people, and a precious thing at that.<br /><br />**** out of ***** (4/5)",positive

"I watched The Babysitter as part of BCI Eclipse' Drive-in Cult Classics (featuring Crown International Pictures releases) on DVD. I think it is a very good film.<br /><br />This movie packs a lot of story into a very short time. You have hippies, rock music, bikers, lesbians, sexual impropriety, blackmail, and murder, all in one spot! <br /><br />The lead actors do a credible job. And, I found the intricately woven plot to be believable and interesting.<br /><br />However, the supporting cast, primarily the bikers, delivers a stilted performance, particularly when asked to deliver lines with more than just a few words. Perhaps they used real bikers, instead of actors. A couple of the characters, in particular, were exceptionally believable.<br /><br />The musical score is absolutely spot-on, for the times, the tempo, and for moving the story forward. I found the music a real treat. I noticed in the opening credits that the movie featured the music of ""The Food,"" I googled them; but, couldn't find anything...<br /><br />In any case, George E.

When Rukh/Karloff is himself poisoned by the uncanny power of this light, we see him actually emitting a ghostly glow on his hands and face like a badly developed negative, drawing attention to the fact that the man we are watching is a projection, an entity viewed on film (only visible, as in a movie theater, when the lights are out).<br /><br />There is a wonderful passage near the beginning where Karloff/Rukh explains his research as being informed by the fact that everything that happens is captured in light which rolls through space for millions of years, as the light from Andromeda was emitted from that Galaxy at a time when the earth was still molten rock. <br /><br />There are passages in the film when this new science is juxtaposed to older cultural vehicles: that of the writer, in the persona of Beulah Bondi/Arabella Stevens; and religion, emblemized in the sculptural figures on the local cathedral Karloff blasts with his projector/ray gun. <br /><br />One has to wonder here if this film was meant to glance at what was going on in Germany at the time, and particularly at Riefenstall's use of film the year before to promote a regime that certainly would go on to do a lot of harm:Triumph of the Will. <br /><br />Happily in the end, Mother (Violet Kemble Cooper) intervenes, reminding Janos Rukh of the first rule of science. <br /><br />If only more movies made you want to stand up in the theater and shout: ""I can see!""",positive

"Susan Seidelman seems to have had a decent career with a few top notch credits under her belt. I'm certainly glad she bounced back from this film which seems to have its admirers. I'm not one of them.<br /><br />I've seen better acting in high school plays than I did in Smithereens. The plot such as it is involved young Susan Berman who is ambitious to make it in the world of music and is willing to do just about anything to get there. She even rejects the sincere advances of a young artist who is living out of his van off the East River played by Brad Rijn.<br /><br />Young Mr. Rijn contributes the worst performance in the film, in fact one of the worst acting jobs I've seen in a long time. No wonder he's not gone anywhere.<br /><br />I will say that Seidelman's eye for the camera is a good one in capturing the familiar East Village locations where the film was mostly shot. But her work with her live performers didn't measure up. I'm not sure she had that much raw material to work with.<br /><br />Look fast and you'll see a very young Christopher Noth before Law and Order and Sex in the City as a street hustler.<br /><br />If you like punk rock, you might sit through this for the soundtrack. I'll stick to Bing Crosby.",negative

And The Virtue signaling was so on-the-nose throughout the movie that it was laughable.

"In Joel Schumacher, you have one of the most inconsistent film makers of all time. But this is common knowledge; I think his main problem is the array of genres that he covers whilst at the same time, failing to develop any sort of certain style that might label him an auteur. Hitchcock liked his suspense and his horror/thriller; Chaplin liked his comedy; Scorsese likes his crime driven mafia stories amongst others and Spielberg likes his large scale, big budget adventure films that combine just enough violence for the adults and fun for the kids. Other more obscure examples include Kubrick and Welles who covered too much to write about here.<br /><br />But Schumacher is the sort of guy who makes a flawed film revolving around a great idea or a really quite enjoyable film revolving around a seemingly dull premise. Falling Down had a great idea behind it but I found it flawed and anticlimactic with too many scenes seemingly relying on comedy. Batman is a superhero; superhero films have been big hits recently so how he managed to make not one but two appalling superhero films is beyond me. Then comes 8MM; a film with a basic premise that is executed in an impressive manner before Tigerland which is Schumacher's best film from what I've so far seen, in my opinion. With the war genre, laughter isn't something you'd associate with it for most of the time. I can remember scoffing at the absurdity of the D-Day landings during Saving Private Ryan: at the time when I first saw the film, I had not much knowledge of the Second World War bar when it began and finished. My eyebrows were up, my mouth slightly open with a weak 'I can't believe it smile' on my face. Needless to say, it was because of that film I searched out learning a bit more on what that event was all about and the war as a whole. In Tigerland, you are invited to laugh at the absurdity of war through Bozz (Farrell), a tough and egotistical soldier training for the Vietnam War.<br /><br />But what's clever here is that there are no jaw dropping war scenes of fighting and death and destruction; just one man and his battle with the system for most of the time. The things he says and the audacity at which he deals with his predicament is reminiscent of a school child winding up a series of teachers at an extremely strict boarding school. Tigerland may borrow from Full Metal Jacket in the sense it is a training routine for the Vietnam War but egos and superegos play more of a part here, I think. The superegos that are the drill sergeants go up against Bozz whose ego is extremely large. There is also the third part of Freud's triangle that sneaks into Bozz: the ID. Compared to all the other soldiers who all have rather large egos, Bozz is the only one brave enough to show it in front of the sergeants thus suggesting he is allows what he shouldn't do to float to the surface and express itself: ""You are all dead in this situation!"" barks a sergeant. ""Any Questions?"" ""Yeah, if I'm dead how come I can ask a question?"" replies Bozz whose punishments such as push-ups and dirt eating seem to un-faze him in true ID style; that is he enjoys the punishments.<br /><br />Also regarding the superegos, Bozz at one point tries to command a group of soldiers in field training. This is something the existing captain of the squad cannot do thus suggesting he is lacking in both the superego required for the job and the confidence to tell Bozz he is in charge. What follows is an actual conversation between Bozz and an existing drill sergeant who gives him his Christian name. This is where Private Wilson's (Whigham) character steps in: His uncontrollable rage and anger at Bozz explodes at certain time all culminating in the film's only real scenes of a shootout which is in the form of a training exercise in a river. Wilson cannot control his impulses and dislike toward Bozz and acts out.<br /><br />What I also liked about Tigerland is that it's shot in such a way that is brave. While lacking in innovation, Tigerland seems to use lower grade film stock or lesser cameras to get across its gritty look. Make no mistake that this could have been a pretty looking film with lots of colour and attractiveness. But, we get a documentary approach in the final piece making everything look like it was shot on a typical everyday camera for TV; the emphasis on the hand held is also apparent but Schumacher is clever: he never allows the film to become too much like a mockumentry whilst at the same time suggesting the film's budget could've been half of what it was. It's worth saying here that Spielberg said he wanted Saving Private Ryan to look like actual reel footage or something along those lines and as if it was recorded from the war scenes.<br /><br />While being very funny and entertaining, Tigerland is still a great study of what makes people tick; not necessarily in war but in the closest possible substitute. Its study on one man and how much he hates the system that he cannot even take it seriously is fascinating as is the drive of each soldier. There are several memorable scenes and situations culminating in a happy, if not unhappy ending that'll open your mind and make you think about what it's perhaps really like in the military.",positive

"Ramin Bahrani sets up a scene early on in Chop Shop that immediately had me identifying with where the character of Ale (Alejandro Polanco) and his friend were coming from. The two of them get on a subway, and as soon as the doors close they ask if they could have everyone's attention for a moment, and that they are selling candy bars or M&M's or something, and then they proceed to sell some bars. If you (as I) have ever been on a subway in New York city, at any time, this is the kind of situation that happens so often you almost don't notice it. Often the people on a subway will see kids like these or minorities selling something or announcing and talking about something on a subway and not pay them any mind. Bahrani's focus isn't necessarily just on kids who hock things for sale on subway rides, but on survival and the state of being one is in when in the lower class in America. It is, subsequently in his hands, thoughtful and heartbreaking, usually at once.<br /><br />To compare it to Pixote or the Bicycle Thief isn't too far of a leap (actually in the latter at least the father and son have each other), though Bahrani is specific in his intentions in his documentary style. We care about this character Ali, no older than eleven and working in a car shop cleaning some cars and helping take apart others, and his sister who comes from out of town to stay with him. But it's not simply because we're force-fed any clichés, aside from, you know, a brother and sister (more-so the brother) trying to take care of one another. Bahrani makes the story accessible through the simple aspiration Ali has, the kind of goal that is possible attainable in his situation: saving up enough to buy a used food truck that Ali and Isamar can operate themselves.<br /><br />It's all Ali is working for, but what Bahrani shows us in brutal detail is this work, what Ali has to do to make it happen even if its distasteful things like ripping hubcaps off of tires from cars in Shea Stadium or, at one point, stealing a purse in a desperate moment. This makes it all the more serious an issue when Ale sees what his sister does for money on the side at night, doing sexual favors for men in an abandoned truck on the side of the road. He doesn't mention it and pushes it aside, but its always something that adds to the tension, something Ale wants to protect his sister from. It adds to the tragedy when Ale finds out the real cost of what it will take to make the food truck into a profit-maker, a cost that just further adds to the anguish that he just internalizes.<br /><br />One could look immediately at the fact that Ale is an orphan in such a neighborhood as the one in the area of Queens the film was shot in- naturally, as with a work of neo-neo realism (lets just call it realism), featuring practically all non-professional actors in the parts of the mechanics and workers and people on the streets- but Bahrani is focused more-so on the here and the now, and that is what makes Chop Shop so immediate and heartfelt. Not a trace of melodrama is in the film, barely even music accompaniment aside from the live Latino music coming from the cars and radios. Sometimes Bahrani will focus on a very subtle moment that makes it pronounced in further scenes, like the way Ale is awake but acts like he's asleep the first night after he witnesses Isamar's late-night tryst, and we see as she slinks into bed she probably knows he's awake but neither can say a word. Or, in a lot of other scenes, poetic touches that seem seamless, like when the man shows Ale how feeding the pigeons work.<br /><br />It's rough and gritty, as you can expect, and it doesn't give much hope for its main characters despite the few moments of happiness sprinkled about. It's also a superbly shot hand-held film, where the technique, as with a lot of movies made in its urban-set tone and approach, informs and compliment the subjects on screen and what they're doing, but it also is never recklessly shot or too flashy. The filmmaker has a superb 'real-life' cast (Ale was plucked from a NYC public school without any experience) and knows how to not waste a shot, while at the same time achieve a brutal artistry with just showing what he shows. It's not City of God or Pixote; it's its own little masterpiece on a character or characters we usually would just not give a second look to (or a first one barely) on our way in a city such as New York. If you're not moved by Ale and his daily struggles, I don't know what to do for you.",positive

"When Melville's ""Pierre; or The Ambiguities"" hit bookstores in 1852, his first publication since ""Moby Dick"" a year earlier, the public response was similar to that found among the IMDB reviews of ""POLA X"". Newspapers even published headlines like: ""Melville Insane!"" which, of course, he wasn't. But, when one compares the writing styles found in ""Moby Dick"" and ""Pierre,"" one finds in the latter a sharp departure from the simple and often declamatory style found in the former. Clearly, he was mimicking the overly florid style of the now-forgotten Victorian Romances that were easily outselling his immortal ""Moby Dick."" He was not content, however, to turn out the sort of product that his publishers wanted, and that surely would have sold. His version of a Victorian romance was a twisted, cynical one, perhaps, but brilliant in its synthesis. The alternate title: ""The ambiguities"" is quite appropriate. As Pierre searches for, and thinks he finds, truth, we become more and more uncertain what and whom to believe. As he searches for happiness, he becomes more and more miserable.<br /><br />""POLA X"" is a fascinating adaptation of this novel, set in modern or nearly modern France. Though, in some ways, it leaves little to the imagination, and shows us graphically the incestuous relations that Melville could only hint at, the ambiguities which make the novel and its message so alluring are perfectly in tact. The questions it raises are ones that few films have thought to ask, yet the answers are left to the viewer.<br /><br />I recommend a reading of the novel, which is much shorter than ""Moby Dick,"" before seeing this movie. I hope more people discover this tantalizing film.",positive

"Like several other reviewers here, I'm surprised to see many negative reviews on this film. Dan O'Bannon's previous effort was the groundbreaking 'Alien' of 1979. Because it and 'Star Wars' introduced the stylistic approach of 'Used' or 'Dirty Space' in art-direction for these kinds of features doesn't mean that this was the only way to produce them.<br /><br />Rather than dismiss 'Lifeforce' out-of-hand as a sort of schlock and primitive exploitation feature, it's important to recognize that the film draws upon the 'esteemed' traditions of British horror and science-fiction - specifically Hammer and American International features like Quatermass (specifically 'Quatermass and the Pit', 1967), Doctor Who and 'The Day of the Triffids' (1963), if not the works of Gerry Anderson ('UFO', 'Space:1999' and 'Thunderbirds'). But none of these influences would be a surprise if other reviewers recognized writer O'Bannon's genre-scholarly appreciation for 'Queen of Blood'(1966) and 'It! The Terror from Beyond Space'(1958) - the immediate sources for 'Alien' (1979).<br /><br />Granted this film has some 'legacy' elements, but perhaps it's worth comparing this film to its more immediate peers - 1981's 'An American Werewolf in London' and 'The Company of Wolves' (1984) - other 80's films that share a 'looking-back' while they adapt those stories to the 80's zeitgeist. All three films drew on earlier incarnations of the same, but substantially sexed-up their themes (because they could), and, at the same time they recognized the tongue-in-cheek, humorous aspects of their projects.<br /><br />Neil Jordan's 'Wolves' played to many of the psychoanalytic memes floating around at the during the '80's, while 'American Werewolf' curdled its theme as a 'coming-of-age' film. It's called artistic license, and the adaptations of these three films are no less valid than the latter-day dramedy inherent in the 'Scream' franchise, 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' and 'Final Destination'. But these teen-targeted, films seem to be part of a box-office trend, whereas the 80's films like 'Lifeforce' belong a canon of British sci-fi - even if this one was written by an American.<br /><br />In many ways this film holds up much better than latter-day disaster and alien-invasion flicks ('Independence Day', 'Armageddon', 'Deep Impact') in that the 'solutions' don't reside in gun-battles, weaponized payloads and testosterone. At the opposite end of the pole, it is unfortunate that Steven Soderbergh and James Cameron didn't examine Tarkowski and Lem more closely before they remade 'Solaris'...<br /><br />The goal of this film was fun, not ponderousness or stupidity.<br /><br />7/10",positive

"It's not hard to imagine what the main problem for a screenwriter is who wants to have 18 equally well written characters with about the same amount of screen time in a movie that last around 90 minutes. It's almost impossible not to fall back on stereotypes and that is also what writer-director Ralf Westhoff does here. Very few of the characters can be recognized as people that you and me know in real life, many of them are just characterized with two or three attributes and stay vague. I am aware of that but still think that ""Shoppen"" is successful, namely that it accomplishes just what it wants to. It is a film with very well written dialogue, extremely good acting and a film that made me laugh out loud really often. I don't think that this film wants to make a deep going analysis of loneliness in our modern society, or that it wants to be moral commentary on speed-dating. It's a movie about something that exists and people and their motivation to use it. Funny and entertaining.",positive

"I got this movie from Netflix after a long waiting time, so I was anticipating it greatly when it arrived. My worst fears were that it would be plodding, as well as... well, you know what all the screaming fan girls were babbling about? GACKTnHYDE=hawt yaoi love? That sort of thing? Dreading it. I was very, very pleasantly surprised. The movie was surprisingly watchable, even if the filming and music did make it feel like someone was going to bust out a pair of nun-chucks every two scenes, and the acting on Gackt's part was quite good. Hyde, being, um, Hyde, acted as a quasi-romantic friend/gang member character that anyone who saw him on stage would hardly be surprised by. He's one of my two major beefs with the film itself. But the rest of the cast (including the child actors in the opening scene) were very good at doing what they did- which was, mostly, get shot at and yelled at. But my second problem was very minor, having to do with the goriness. It seemed way too suspense-horror to me- like every scene where someone is shot they either slump over, really most sincerely dead, or lay there burbling for a rather long time. But Sho just... takes the shots, repeatedly, keels over, bubbles a LOT while he talks, and makes Hyde cry. All in all, if you're a fan of any of the actors or just a j-film fan, it's definitely worth a watch.",positive

The movie steamrolled over events that should have been mentioned and mentioned events that could have been omitted. I do want to give a salute to the performances of the stars...they had a tough job because they didn't really look like the Stooges, but the spirit was there. After watching the movie, I pulled out a tape from American Movie Classics that had the real deal on it and laughed myself silly. The movie was pretty tough emotionally, especially after Curly has the stroke and Moe needs to keep the business going. When Curley started crying I lost it...Like I said, the movie was good, but could have been and SHOULD have been much, much better. Maybe it's fitting though...the Stooges got ripped off when they were alive and now, 25 years later, it happens again.",negative
"One of quite a few cartoon Scooby Doo films, ""Scooby Doo and the Loch Ness Monster"" turns out to be entertaining, exciting, interesting, funny and also does a surprisingly good interpretation of the Highlands of Scotland.

Gravely Shannon tells the gang that she believes to have seen the Loch Ness Monster.

"This isn't the best romantic comedy ever made, but it is certainly pretty nice and watchable. It's directed in an old-fashioned way and that works fine. Cybill Shepherd as Corinne isn't bad in her role as the woman who can't get over her husband's death. She has a sexy maturity. But I can't say much for Ryan O'Neal as Philip, because he is, at best, nondescript. He may be adequate in the role, but that's not good enough.<br /><br />However, I get the feeling that some of the characters, particularly Alex and Miranda, are not written with enough in-depth thought. We don't know anything else about them because minutes after they appear the story gets thick, and the writers don't tell us much beyond what happens. But that problem was salvaged because Mary Stuart Masterson has a fresh-as-a-daisy sweetness to brighten it up, and Robert Downey Jr. is so charming that he melts the screen. Even his smile is infectious. And it so happens that his big dreamy eyes are perfect for the deja vu and flashback scenes.<br /><br />Anyway, this movie is light and easy and if you like them that way, why not give it a try.<br /><br />",positive

"I was stoked to hear Captain Marvel, a woman was going to be the strongest Avenger!  When the trailer came out, I watched it as soon as it dropped.  And was immediately dissatisfied.  Brie Larson felt so flat.  Ă˘Well, it's just a trailer.  Maybe the way it's cut together just isn't doing much for you.Ă˘?  So the next trailer comes out.  Zero improvement.  Not to be discouraged though, I shove all of my misgivings over possible bad casting aside.  Finally, opening weekend!  I enter the theater ready to be energized and empowered.  I walked out unmoved.  I'm not evening going to go into choppy fight scenes and disjointed score/soundtrack (great songs, just awkward transitioning).  I never saw Captain Marvel, I just saw Brie Larson blandly delivering her lines.  I've seen more believable deliveries from high school plays.  She never made me believe.  Lines that should've displayed the perfect mix of cockiness, fearlessness, and wit became merely cheesy, sometime bordering on cringey.  A CGI cat/flurkin was more capable of humor than Larson as Captain Marvel.  Not once did she make me care about her struggles, partly because she never conveyed that they were actually a struggle for herself. nnI'm giving this film a middle rating because as unbelievable Larson was, the rest of the cast sold me on it.  Both Fury and the Skrull general got several chuckles from me, and Marie displayed emotional depth despite more awkward dialogue.  The Stan Lee tribute made me feel more (choked up a bit) then the climax of the film, and the Dark Phoenix trailer beforehand had me more engaged and emotionally invested than the entire film put together (Sophie Turner's sobs at the beginning choke me up every. single. time.).

"It is easy for a movie that tries to be suspenseful to wind up being merely uninteresting. It happens quite often. Not only is Dark Harbor uninteresting, but it is very poorly done. Scene after scene is tacked on to an otherwise overdone premise. A troubled couple picks up a troubled stranger only to find more trouble.<br /><br />Some movies build tension by building the story. Dark Harbor keeps adding on to its story but never building upon it. I was hoping that like other movies, the suspense would finally explode. It never does. Also, the characters have no continuity from scene to scene. They may act one way in one scene, but then act a completely different way in another scene. At first, you think that they are merely out of character, but by the end you realize that they are not really characters at all. They are just props for the final twist. The final ten minutes try to be shocking. Instead, it's rather lame and uninteresting. The only thing that was shocking to me was that the movie finally ended. At less than ninety minutes the movie still feels way too long.<br /><br />This isn't one of those low-budget gems.

"I really wasn't sure about this movie going into it.  I had no background knowledge of this character and wasn't really eager about her story, mostly because of that ridiculous name (""Captain Marvel""?? C'mon!!).  But now that I've seen the movie and understand the character, I like her a lot more, and am even keen to see how the character progresses in the next Avengers installment. She is tough as nails and is pretty badass even before she gets her powers.  The MCU sort of has a schism between the space-world and the earth-world, and the stories about the heroes from each have their own vibe to them; this one splits the difference, bringing a space story literally down to earth.  Stylistically and tonally, it rides the coattails of the Guardians of the Galaxy films rather than any of the Avengers' stories. The film sports a rad 90's soundtrack in the same way that Guardians was loaded with classic 70's songs, and it tries to infuse the same kind of humor into the story (but mostly fails, the humor feels forced and generally falls pretty flat).  Story-wise, it mostly follows the standard origin-story formula and doesn't boil down to anything new.  But as they say, the devil is in the details, and this is where it succeeds. There is no love interest subplot, the story is all about Carol Danvers as an individual and how she comes into her own as a superhero.  Not that love-stories were ever a big feature in Marvel films (with the possible exception of the Thor movies), but it is nonexistent here.  Carol is never once sexualized and the fact that she's a woman is never discussed; it's not even a factor.  Finally, girls and women everywhere will have a Halloween costume that keeps them warm!  I can see why she is a feminist icon, it's a real rarity when a female character is given a story that does not involve her femininity and/or sexuality in any way.  The story is well-written and delivers some good twists and turns, all while somehow maintaining continuity with the storylines from the 20 movies that came before it.  The dialogue is sometimes clunky and not everything makes sense all the time (I still don't understand why she never gets injured - is she Wolverine in addition to an energy-infused human power bomb?), but the plot and the character motivations are convincing, and that goes a long way.  It's also fun to see the characters you know and love from SHIELD as their younger selves: Fury when he still had his eye; Coulson when he still had his hair. Oh, and the lovely tribute to Stan Lee in the opening credits could not have been more perfect; it brought a tear to my eye (and his cameo in this one is probably my favorite).  Overall, I definitely had a good time, but I'm not ""marveling"" at this one.  As I've said before, after 21 movies, the novelty is wearing thin and with each film, I get a little less enthusiastic. Still, this is a worthy addition to the franchise, even if the only real barrier it breaks is the glass ceiling.",controversial
"This is an astounding film. As well as showing actual footage of key events in the failed coup to oust Chavez, we are given the background picture which describes a class-divided society.

'Be careful what you say in front of your servants' is a revealing comment.

No, it's because of the whole eye situation. He lost an eye... for a FAQN JOKE?!?! Srsly?! That's supposed to be a big dramatic reveal and instead, they pull the Last Jedi on it... No. Just no. nSpeaking of which I'm a bit pissed that they decided to change the cat's name from Chewie to Goose. I mean what was the point when Disney already own Star Wars... nnThe other gripe is the protagonist. I'm not gonna go into subtext because people will accuse me of ""conspiracy theory"" but I think the problem she suffers from is the same as ""reveal secret villain"" problem. As in, a character, his relationship and personality are shown and then it's revealed that all we've known about the character was a lie, it's not the same character we've been fed information about for the past hour. That's not the case if the character is actually shown in a flashback or some other ""way-back machine"" what&how he was actually was, but we don't get that from Carol, all we get are flashbacks of ""boys telling her she's not good enough cuz she's a girl"", which kinnda grind my gears and other people TELLING US what she's actually like doesn't help.nnAnother gripe is... does Captain Marvel have any actual weaknesses? Because couple that with people behind the movies saying ""she's the ONLY ONE who can beat Thanos"" is giving away red flags, especially with ending where she's singlehandedly tearing through the Kree ships. nnWhich brings me to the final gripe, what was the point of Ronan the Accuser being there? All he did was stand around and then ran with tail between the legs when Carol showed up. This goes hand in hand with my previous gripe because it would've been great if Carol squared off against Ronan since he was established in Guardians of the Galaxy to be able to wield an Infinity Stone and Carol's powers come from the energy of an Infinity Stone. But no, Ronan is portrayed as a total wimp and a missed opportunity. nnThe movie was okay, but I wouldn't mark it as anything special. nI'm also perplexed why they didn't just make Monica Rambeau Captain Marvel since she was the original female Captain Marvel instead of the current unlikable Carol Danvers version. =/ĂŻÂ»Âż",negative
Brie Larson did a fantastic job as Captain Marvel but the story was filled with lazy writing and huge plot holes. This is what happens when Marvel gets lazy and tries to squeeze in an extra character at the last minute. ,negative
"Pokemon 3 is little more than three or four episodes of the TV series, strung together without the usual commercials. The story is typical of Pokemon (conflict, fighting, and a resolution where all are happy in the end), and there is nothing original or unusual in the animation. Some of the holes in the plot are filled in (over the closing credits!) without explanation, and everything is just a bit too sweet.<br /><br />Why see it on the big screen? The only reason is to be a part of your child's world. Both of my sons enjoy Pokemon, and by my showing an interest in what they like, we are closer. Seeing a film in a theatre is still different than seeing it on the tube, and my sons enjoy the full movie-going experience. I gave the movie a 4, mostly from my children's point of view.<br /><br />",negative
"A very good movie full of action, drama, humor, and 80-90s easter eggs. Brie Larson does an excellent job as a strong lead. I look forward to seeing her in the New Avengers movie. Samuel Jackson does a great job as well. By the way, the cat was awesome. You show'em Goose.",positive

"Really fun Marvel Movie. Slow paced at the start, but it gets better and better. My only complaint is that the viewer never gets much scenes about Carol's backstory. In the trailers, its set up like you'll actually see long flashbacks of her past, maybe like 10-15 minutes worth. However, the flashbacks are crammed in about 2 minutes of the movie in a trippy like sequence. I really wished we actually got to see those memories more fleshed out so we connect more with Carol. nIm hoping if theres a sequel, then we actually get to see those memories. Anyways, the rest of the movie was great and had some funny moments. I can at least say for myself that this movie will shut up the pathetic trolls. Also, this movie isnt forcing any type of propaganda like the trolls are spitting. Stay pressed! But this movie is rising!",controversial
"Grand epic as it is, Kenneth Branagh's monumental rendering of what is perhaps William Shakespeare's most popular tragedy suffers under the weight of its four hour playing time and certainly takes some real staying power. Two entirely separate sittings would most likely be better in order to fully appreciate what is certainly high class film making. While I absolutely acknowledge this masterpiece as such, I must confess to a lack of enthusiasm for the old bards flamboyance, his rhetoric (and he sends himself up so well) and his many flourishes. Thus ""Hamlet"" loses its impact as it loses its grip.<br /><br />From Patrick Doyle's music to Alex Thomson's cinematography to Tim Harvey's exquisite sets, the movie is a feast of visual and aural delights, which compliments a fine cast. Branagh has taken on three huge mantels, adapting, directing and playing. His adaptation is superb, his direction strong, but by the time he got to the role of Hamlet, the strain seemed to be showing; yet still he does a fine job in what is an incredibly taxing role. Derek Jacobi gobbles up the sinister Claudius with glee, and Julie Christie is most dramatic as his queen, Gertrude. Richard Briers is marvellous as Polonius, and Charlton Heston is once again a strong screen influence as the player King. Many others drop by, including Jack Lemmon (superb in a very small role), Billy Crystal, Dame Judi Dench, Sir John Mills, Sir John Gielgud, Sir Richard Attenborough and Gerard Depardieu. The acting prize though must go to one of the great thespian discoveries of recent years, Kate Winslet. Hers is a moving portrayal of the most tragic figure in this whole affair, Ophelia.<br /><br />To finish (before this review goes on longer than the film), I must say it is the length that really tests the viewer in this movie. Branagh has directed with purpose, giving many important, impacting scenes. Too many of them outstay their welcome. Watching this film holds a fantastic reminder of the many pearls of wisdom we have garnered from it. ""Neither a lender nor a borrower be"" or ""Be true to thyself"". And of course: ""To be or not to be"".<br /><br />The opening two hours does take some perseverance, but if you do manage to stay tuned you are sure to be treated to a rousing finale which gathers momentum from the tragic funeral onward.<br /><br />Monday, June 8, 1998 - Hoyts Croydon",positive
"I wanted to love this movie. How could I not love it? Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Stanley Donen; all icons in their own way. However, the train wreck that was Suzy Parker ruined the entire experience for me. Her acting was so appalling that I sat there with my jaw hanging open, not believing my eyes or ears. I could barely make it through one viewing, THAT'S how hideous she is in this.<br /><br />Cary? Gorgeous and in fine dramatic form. Jayne? Adorable, endearing, and obviously having a ball. The supporting cast does alright, and the city of San Francisco is captured in all its stunning, retro elegance.<br /><br />Then you see Suzy Parker attempting to speak her lines with a woodenness, a deadness, a cluelessness that simply defies belief. Who told this creature she could ACT?? Oy VEY, people.",negative
"This movie is phenomenal and a must-see. With this and Black Panther, Marvel is on a role with exceptionally-executed movies that speak to our cultural moments, and take us beyond them. This movie is actually feminist, by demonstrateing all that women can be, the diversity of women, the unique struggles they face in our patriarchal society, all the while never reducing or defining them, in part, or entirely by how they are judged by the female-sex oriented, male gaze. I so wish this movie could have been released before Wonder Woman...this is how you do a female-led superhero movie.",controversial

"The action was great, when it was there. Took too long to develop for a Marvel movie this deep into the MCU. Larsen's snarky outlook was funny and great 1/2 the time, but a bit much the other half.

"You don't see the meaning of the title till much later, but you get the point of it in the first few minutes. This directorial debut from Golden Globe nominated (for actor) Danny DeVito, also playing Owen/Ned 'Little Ned' Lift, is a terrific Hitchcock-like film about one man's hate for his wife's book (she stole his), and one man's hate for his mother. Basically, Owen wants to be a good writer, like his teacher Larry Donner (Billy Crystal), and he inspired by murder stories. Larry suggests he see a Hitchcock film, quite ironic, and that is when Owen has the idea to kill Larry's ex-wife, Margaret (Star Trek Voyager's Kate Mulgrew). Owen is inspired by 'Strangers on a Train', swapping murders, so Larry must kill Owen's horrible Momma (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Anne Ramsey). Larry was convinced Owen killed Margaret, and also that he had to/wanted to kill Owen's Momma, but there is a happy ending when months later both Larry and Owen bring out books, Momma died naturally, and they went on a holiday with Beth Ryan (Kim Greist). Also starring Rob Reiner as Joel and Oprah Winfrey. With hilarious moments, a great director/actor and his support, this is a must-see comedy. Very, very good!",positive

It also felt a little judgmental and like it was pushing agendas, which further detracted from this being the good film it should have been.

Also, plot holes... and nothing innovative. nnTo describe it better: I'll say it was like those 6 second dreams you want to remember but instantly forget as soon as you wake up.",negative
"It's just ok. A combination of a weak script and mediocre direction is what caused the main issues of the film. Too much obvious exposition, shaky cam fight scenes, and a clearly uncommitted Brie Larson were all caused by those behind the camera. Brie is a stellar actress, but I think the script she was given along with the direction she was given made her come across as wooden and generic in most scenes. The good are Sam Jackson and the Cat. It definitely wasn't awful, but a few rewrites and a better director(s) would have brought the film to all new highs.",negative

There really isn't a good nemesis.  It almost feels like she has too much power and no one really gave her a good fight.  She just plowed through them.",negative
"This animated feature (a co-production between Ireland, Belgium and France) deals with what is surely one of the oddest subject ever for a movie: the creation in the 9th century of a famous illuminated manuscript, the book of Kells. In this fantastic retelling of that story, a prepubescent boy named Brendan, living in a monastery ruled by his uncle, a stern abbot who is worried preparing the defenses of the abbey from the impending attack by the feared vikings, must get into the forbidding surrounding forest to find the materials that a master illuminator named Aidan needs to finish the book. To do that task, in the forest he unexpectedly finds the help of a friendly fairy named Aisling.Gorgeously and delicately drawn by hand (there is some computer animation in a few key passages) in a manner that wants to resemble both medieval and traditional Celtic art, and with a very creative use of color and all sorts of geometric shapes, this film is relentlessly strange, but is a good strange, not of the off putting variety but of the eye opening sort. If one were to nitpick - beyond some anachronisms, like an African monk in 9th century Ireland  one would have to say that the blend of Catholic mysticism with Celtic paganism in this movie never really coalesce. And the comic relief is sometimes a bit too broad. That's why I cannot give them the highest ranking. But these are minor problems with an otherwise delightful and superbly imaginative film.",positive

"As a devotee of Ms. Frank, I remember being so excited that the play was being re-made for TV. That is, until I saw it... This film is a prime example of how IMPORTANT casting is, and how directing plays such an important part in creating the sense of purpose. The casting of any CENTRAL role is CRUCIAL to a production of this sort...shows like AUNTIE MAME and MAN OF LA MANCHA are totally dependent on the charisma of the lead actor. And in the cast of this movie, the whole thing is destroyed by the atrocious casting of Melissa Gilbert in the lead role. There is not ONE SINGLE MOMENT that Ms. Gilbert even comes close to inhabiting the sensitive, mature spirit of Anne- Ms. Gilbert is ""white-bread"" throughout the movie... the only time I was close to tears was during the reading of Anne's most haunting line: ""I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart""- this is spoken by Ms. Gilbert so rushed, so lacking in conviction, that she might has well burped and achieved the same effect. Film and dance legend Marge Champion was the dialogue coach for this production- she should have refunded her salary! Despite Ms. Gilbert ruining DIARY, other performances are satisfactory for the most part- special kudos to Joan Plowright as Edith, Scott Jacoby as Peter and Clive Reville as Mr. Dussell. Maxmillian Schell does not have the deep-rooted soul and spirit as Otto as does the creator of the role on stage and film(Joseph Schildkraut), but he's okay. Doris Roberts and James Coco as The Van Danns are relatively superficial in their parts- they're shrill and bombastic, but again, only on the surface. This COULD be due to the fact that the pacing of the project is way too rushed(as noted in previous postings)- this film clocks in 45 minutes shorter than the film version- the difference owing to the pauses for dramatic effect, which apparently is necessary to propagate the appropriate MOOD for the story. This is NOT mandatory viewing, especially for youngsters learning about Anne Frank for the first time- stick to the original film version, and or even better, the TV production of ANNE FRANK: THE TRUE STORY starring Ben Kingsley, which is the CLOSEST thing to capturing the heartbreak and reality of Anne's situation ever filmed! Note: Especially appalling is the fact that Melora Marshall, who plays Anne's sister Margot, is NOT included in the opening credits along with all the other members of The Secret Annex... she's listed in the post-credits along with the actors playing Miep and Mr. Kraler. If I was Ms. Marshall, I would have SUED!",negative
"Awesome MCU film, the random unwarranted hate had me a bit pessimistic but it exceeded all expectations.

"Generally over rated movie which boasts a strong cast and some clever dialog and of course Dean Martin songs. Problem is Nicholas Cage, there is no chemistry between he and Cher and they are the central love story. Cher almost makes up for this with her reactions to Cage's shifting accent and out of control body language. Cage simply never settles into his role. He tries everything he can think of and comes across as an actor rather than real person and that's what's needed in a love story. Cage has had these same kind of performance problems in other roles that require more of a Jimmy Stewart type character. Cage keeps taking these roles, perhaps because he likes those kind of movies but his own energy as an actor doesn't lend itself to them, though he's gotten better at it with repeated attempts. He should leave these type of roles to less interesting actors who would fully commit to the film and spend his energy and considerable talent in more off beat roles and films where he can be his crazy interesting self.",negative

MCU likes to suddenly nerf characters..see Thor, Hulk, and Vision. Doubt it since she doesn't have the stones.

"To begin with, I have to admit I've never been a big fan of the Dutch movie-genre. Unfortunately watching De Dominee hasn't made me change my mind. It shares some common flaws, like having a plot that's too predictable and linear for my taste. <br /><br />Worse however is that the cast has their dialogues as if they were stage-actors in a play. Unfortunately this is common too in many Dutch movies and, at least to me, makes it impossible to feel any kind of involvement with the main characters.<br /><br />The actor that plays Adri (I'm sorry, I forgot his name at the moment) is at least delivering a decent performance, and is one of the reasons I don't rate this movie even worse.Another reason is the fact that at least it seems to have had some budget, and the production seems professional. <br /><br />Ironically the fact that the acting is often too articulated might not be so much of a problem if you don't speak Dutch,although I already warned you that the plot isn't spectacular either, but at least it might make it an acceptable movie to watch.",negative

It was a little bit bland with an okay performance from Brie Larson.

"The Last Jedi is the worst kind of bad sequel, the kind that retroactively affects other films you previously loved. It's hard to pin down just what vector to attack TLJ from. There are so many ways in which this film is terrible. Whether it's how, by the end, the title makes no sense, or whether it's how, from the very beginning, the film has NO respect for anyone who liked The Force Awakens at face-value. None of the questions from The Force Awakens are answered, and the ones that are are dismissively waved away with an answer of, ""it doesn't matter"". The biggest flaw of The Last Jedi is that, by the end of the film, the three main leads STILL have not talked to one another. They're not fast friends as Han, Luke and Leia were. They are complete strangers. Finn and Rei have hugged more than they have talked at this point and it's beginning to be creepy. Finn and Poe's immediate bro-mance was cool in the first film. Now it makes no sense.",negative

"My main comment on this movie is how Zwick was able to get credible actors to work on this movie? Impressive cast  even for the supporting characters, none of which helps this movie really. I have to admit though, Tom Hank's cameo almost made it worth it  what was that about Tom? Did you lose a bet? The best cameo of the movie was Joe Isuzu though - by far a classic! The premise is good. Basinger's character, struggling with existence as a Pink Lady, is making her way toward Vegas motel by motel pitching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales. This happens as Corbett's character is on his way to Vegas to deliver an Elvis suit to his soon to be ex-wife motivated by.what else.extortion. As they both make their way, they have numerous run-ins with Elvis impersonators who on their way to an Elvis impersonating convention in Vegas. Soon, the FBI gets involved and begins to track what they think is an Elvis impersonator serial killer. Unfortunately, premise doesn't mean the movie was good.<br /><br />When watching this movie, imagine you are back in the first grade  when story lines and continuity aren't really important. It is much more enjoyable to just watch Basinger look beautiful in her Pink Lady outfit rather than wondering why what she is doing doesn't really make sense. The movie tries hard, but ultimately falls way way way short. Ultimately, it is filled with ideas that could have theoretically been funny but in practice were not that funny.<br /><br />It isn't the worst, but you may find you yourself feel like leaving the building when watching this one Don't say I didn't warn you!",negative
I watched this movie because it it has a superhero that will answer the distress call from Nicky Fury shown in Infinity War. But this is the worst movie in India released in 2019 by a foreign studio. Given that there are big budget Hindi action movies in 2019 Marvel needs to do way better. Most uninspiring lead!n.  vies,negative
One of the weakest marvel movies. Didnt feel like the big lead up to Endgame and failed to make me care about the character. Plus I don't see why she is being pushed as some feminist icon when Black Widow has been here since the start.

"If one were to return to the dawn of the talking picture, one would prophesy a bright future for Harold Lloyd. Unlike his competitors, he was comedic actor trained on the legitimate stage not a performed raised in the purgatory of the music hall or vaudeville circuit. He had a good voice which matched his image. Moreover, from 1924 on, his ""silent"" films had incorporated sequences based on sound gags lost on the audience (e.g., the bell sequence at the Fall Frolic from THE FRESHMAN and the monkey sequence in THE KID BROTHER). Yet Lloyd's sound features consistently failed at the box office once the novelty of WELCOME DANGER had ebbed. Lloyd blamed his fall on many external sources, but never realized that the Glass character's enemy was not sound but the Great Depression. Pre-Depression audiences, giddy with optimism, may have rooted for this ambitious go-getter in whom they saw their surrogate; Depression audiences despised him as the person likely to foreclose on their mortgage and throw them in the gutter. Compounding this problem of character choice is Lloyd's perception as an insincere glad hander. Sincerity, of course, is a subjective appraisal, but it is undeniable that Lloyd, despite his own tragic upbringing, could never play a convincing down-and-outer. Perhaps this is because he feared returning to that state permanently. THE CAT'S-PAW fails for these reasons, but it alone suffers from the revelation of Lloyd's pro-fascist agenda. Many film scholars believe that Lloyd was prompted to make this film because he saw the presidency of FDR as a dictatorship bent on soaking the rich and soft on crime. We should remember that he was not alone in this feeling. DeMille had directed THIS DAY AND AGE, a pro-police state drama, the previous year. We should also remember that America was founded by hotheaded tax protesters and continues to be motivated by those who want something without paying for it. TCP suffered because it treated fascism lightly in a ""comedy"" and because its release was particularly ill-timed given the events in Germany in that year. The Production Code of 1934 would ultimately curtail the glorification of vigilante justice and reaffirm the rule of constitutional law, cumbersome as it might be. The ideal of the benevolent despot, the good-intentioned all-powerful leader who brings about a utopia once freed of the checks and balances on this omnipotence, dates to classical antiquity. For this reason, totalitarian regimes fear laughter even though it acts as a safety valve. Ironically, the mere existence of TCP, a film which demonizes the democratic experience of the country of its origin, shows that FDR's America was secure enough to accept criticism. One sees no parallel criticism in Hitler's Germany, Stalin's USSR, or Mussolini's Italy. But can one laugh at the gallows humor of pending fascism? Lloyd's unnuanced film is skewed to the right and might have been written by Dr Goebbels himself if he'd had a sense of humor, of course. It posits an alternative history in which a chosen one restores order and lost honor BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY, and does so with good nature and fun. Impending fascism approached by the left is, of course, Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR. This latter film has the benefit of being set in another country and based on a thinly veiled actual persona and events. THE GREAT DICTATOR produces few laughs today because it under-estimated the extent of human evil, but it succeeds despite its artless and inappropriate speechifying, because it has the distinct advantage of being vindicated by history. Lloyd, however, should be credited for two things: first, he neither made any further pro-fascist films nor produced any subsequently hypocritically pro-allied films during the War: second, he never sold TCP to television. The post-1945 world had seen the face of fascism and it wasn't amusing.",negative

"I'd read about FLAVIA THE HERETIC for many years, but I only got to see it early last year, when I went on an insane movie-buying binge, and, for whatever reason, it has been on my mind lately, though it's been some months since I watched it.<br /><br />It's a striking film, set in Italy somewhere around the 15th century. Definitely Medieval-era (though I don't think any specific year is ever given). This being the time of Christian ascendancy, the age is a time of utter madness, and the movie captures this very well.<br /><br />Flavia, our protagonist, is a young lady who encounters a fallen Muslim on a battlefield. He seems a warm and intriguing fellow, and she's immediately taken with him. Her father, a soldier of a a family of some standing, comes along, almost immediately, and murders the wounded man right before her eyes. But she'll continue to see him in her dreams.<br /><br />Her father ships her off to a convent that seems more like an open-air insane asylum--the residents, so harshly repressed by unyielding Medieval Christianity, slowly go mad. Flavia comes under the influence of one of the nuttier nuns. But in a mad world, only the sane are truly mad, and this sociopathic sister clearly recognizes the insanity around her. Her take on the times in which they live strikes a chord with Flavia, who, being young and apparently sheltered, is beginning to question everything about this world in which she finds herself trapped.<br /><br />The movie is unflinching in its portrayal of that world, showcasing a lot of unpleasantness. We see a horse gelded, a lord rape one of the women of his lands in a pig-sty, the pious torture of a young nun. Through it all, Flavia observes and questions, rejecting, eventually, the Christian dogma that creates such a parade of horrors in terms that would gain the movie some criticism over the years for seeming anachronistic. I disagree with that criticism. Flavia's views, though sometimes expressed in ways that vaguely mirror, for example, then-contemporary feminist commentary (the movie was made in 1974), revolve around what are really pretty obvious questions. It is, perhaps, difficult to believe she could be so much of a fish out of water in her own time, but that's the sort of minor point it doesn't do to belabor. Flavia is written in such a way to allow those of our era, or of any era, to empathize with her plight. Getting bogged down on such a matter would be missing the forest for the trees.<br /><br />Flavia is heartened when the Muslims arrive, invading the countryside, and she finds, in their leader, a new version of the handsome Islamist who still visits her dreams. Smitten with her almost immediately, he allows her to virtually lead his army, becoming a Joan of Arc figure in full battle-gear, and directing the invaders to pull down Christian society, and wreak vengeance upon all those she's seen commit evil.<br /><br />Is she the herald of a new and better world? She may think so, but Muslims of that era weren't big on feminism, either, as she soon learns the hard way. As they say, meet the new boss...<br /><br />This is really just a thumbnail of some of the things that happen in FLAVIA THE HERETIC. The movie is quite grim, and with a very downbeat, rather depressing ending. Not a mass-audience movie at all, to be sure. It's quite good, though, and doesn't belong on the ""nunsploitation"" pile on which it is often carelessly thrown. I think there's much value in the final film, and I'm glad I saw it.",positive
When they re wrote the origin story to fit the political narrative I was a little bit disappointed.

"Honestly it was an ok film, it went beyond my expectations, but that doesn't that they were high.

Speaking of which, who was the villain in there again? The only thing I liked about the movie was Goose the cat. Speaking of Goose, NICK FURY LOST HIS EYE IN THE MOST BULLSHIT WAY POSSIBLE!!!!

"Three words: What a pile..... Two words: Don't bother! One word: Sucked! There are zero reasons to see this movie. Even those Seagal groupies should shy away from this movie. The martial arts, the typical Aikido, are horrible. The martial arts moves themselves are fine but the cinematography is pathetic. The movie actually goes into slow motion whenever Seagal give his ""kill move"" to his victims. Worse yet, is shows the same move three times in rapid succession from three slightly different angles. How stupid. Seagal's acting was plain stupid, but I still give this movie a ""6"" for acting because of the supporting cast whose ""villain"" roles were actually quite entertaining.<br /><br />The plot is just dumb. Seagal plays a Federal Express agent with a license to kill. His character also has that dedicated work ethic which means all of his packages get delivered to the correct people on time - at no extra charge - and nothing stands in his way. Not assassins, political leaders, explosions, or even death.<br /><br />I expect a certain level of violence in a martial arts film, but there are several scenes in this movie of random and horrible acts of violence that lend itself in no way to the advancement of the movie or its story. There is a reason this movie went directly to video and there are tons of reasons to avoid it. No one should bother with this tripe.<br /><br />",negative

Worst part was how she came to her powers which made no sense.  The story was horrible and they way they jumped around with who the bad guys are pissed me off.  Best part was being able to recognize some characters fror the Marvel Universe.  At times the music overwhelmed me and as a 90's kid I couldn't be more pissed how bad they incorporated it.

We have a short time to learn them and have to accept them at face value.

I found myself thinking, ""That's pretty cool. Why did they do that?"" There's this casual thing in the Robert Langdon character where no matter what the issue, he seems to always make the right first move. I suppose it's like watching CSI where they solve incredibly complex cases in a matter of days. They know the lay of the land.

"whereas the hard-boiled detective stories of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler have fitted to cinema like a fox in a chicken coop - indeed creating the definitively modern American genre and style in the process - those of what might be called Golden Age fiction have made barely any impression whatsoever. The problem with books like those of Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers or S.S. Van Dine (on whose work this film is based), is that they are low on action or variety - whereas Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe traverse the mean streets of LA, working class tenements, bars, offices, wealthy mansions, and meet all sorts of exciting dangers and violence, Golden Age fiction is generally fixed in location, the scene of the murder, usually a lavish country house, and the action is limited to investigating clues and interviewing suspects. This is a very static procedure, plot reduced to puzzle.<br /><br />This, of course, is as much ideological as anything else, the Golden Age stories dealing with a society hostile to change and movement; the hard-boiled novels recording an urban reality increasingly moving away from a centre (both of authority, and of a city), dividing itself up into hostile, ever uncontrollable and lawless camps. Another major problem with Golden age fiction is character - because we cannot know the answer to the crime until the end, we cannot gain access to characters' motivations or emotions, being defined solely by their potential need to murder. The detective, unlike the anxious, prejudice-ridden private eyes, are simply there to be brilliant, and maybe a little eccentric.<br /><br />The problem with most films from Golden Age books is that they try to be period recreations of the Merchant Ivory/Jane Austen school, and end up looking silly. There have been successes, for example the radical reworkings of Ellery Queen and others by Claude Chabrol. In the English-speaking world, there have really only been two. The Alistair Sim classic, 'Green For Danger', works because it pushes the form almost into parody, while never betraying the integrity or interest of the mystery.<br /><br />Before that came Michael Curtiz's brilliant 'The Kennel Murder Case'. The narrative is pure Golden Age. A repulsive character is introduced who gives a number of potential suspects reason to kill him. He is duly murdered in a seemingly foolproof manner, indicating suicide, slumped in a locked room. The caricatured policemen fall hopelessly for the bait. It is up to Philo Vance, gentleman and amateur detective, neither old nor fat, to read the clues more insightfully, open the case out of the confines of the room, and eventually solve the case, the corpse being little more than the pretext for intellectual stimulation.<br /><br />What is interesting is not this detective plot - which can only ever be unsatisfying as all solutions are - although it is rarely less than entertaining, and full of comical bits of business. There isn't even really an attempt to 'subvert' the image of the perfect detective - there is one alarming scene where a brutal sergeant threatens to rough up a suspect, with no protest from Vance, but that's about it.<br /><br />What marks 'Kennel' as a classic is its modernity. Curtiz is not generally considered a great auteur, because he has no consistent themes or evidence of artistic development. But he was Hollywood's greatest craftsman, and he is on sensational form here. if the Golden Age detective story is mere puzzle, Curtiz takes this idea to is logical extreme, creating an abstract variation on his source, reducing narrative, character and location to geometry, a series of lines, from the beautiful art-deco sets to the glorious camera movements which suddenly break from a static composition , and, as they glide furiously at an angle, jolt the dead decor to life.<br /><br />This treatment is appropriate to a story that resolutely refuses realism, it is a pattern that turns the detective plot into a hall of mirrors, like the two central brothers, or the original crime itself, borrowed from an 'Unsolved Mysteries' book. This fantasy world of nasty rich men who collect Oriental relics (shades of 'The Moonstone'?), inscrutable Chinese servants, ex-cons turned butlers, dog-loving fops, Runyonesque cops, is the perfect habitat for Vance, a man who will drop a cruise to Europe on a fanciful hunch, who knows the social world of these people, and yet is tainted by his interest in crime and association with the police, or would be if he wasn't anything more than a thinking machine, William Powell, the greatest American comedian of the decade, bravely subsuming his idiosyncratic humanity.<br /><br />But if the treatment is rarefied, the climax is spectacularly brutal, involving vicious dogs and attempted murder. The police and the detective, supposed to be preventing crime, are guilty of inciting one.",positive

Captain Marvel was actually a pretty good movie. I feel like an outsider for saying this but I thought that Brie Larson was a great pick for this role. There were a few scenes that didn't work but all in all it still Was a fun ride for the closing for the MCU. And believe it or not a lot of people were warming up to Captain Marvel in Avengers: Endgame so maybe Captain Marvel II will be The Winter Soldier of the Captain Marvel franchise. There is also a beautiful Stan Lee Moment that I cannot ignore so I have to give this film credit for doing that. I think the franchise just need a new direction and I think a lot of people will start to warm up to Brie when a new director takes in for the franchise. I still to this day don't get the hate.

"It was very lackluster. There was no emotion from the main character. Nothing that I could relate to from a human standpoint. Honestly I am very disappointed that she didn't show some emotion, because emotions are human! She was the amazing warrior with unlimited power. Marvel always worked because it brought a human element to the heroes. There has to be a trade off for being all powerful. She has none. She has done nothing to earn the audience's support. There was an amazing chance. Where Jude Law goads her character into a one on one match. So she laser blasts him because she can. I personally would have loved her to prove that she can beat him fair and square based on her talents and ability. I think it actually does injustice to her character and women in general by having it so that the evil man can only ever be beat with ray beams. Perhaps she could beat him with her wits, skills, etc. The character was very bland and all powerful. Like a more boring superman. She's so powerful she could have beat Thanos single handedly, yet,she is written out of Avengers Endgame because there would be no movie otherwise. nnThe movie goes over the top with nostalgia easter eggs instead of focusing on a strong character and good story. They failed this character so poorly that she'll never recover in the M-She-U. This movie marks the beginning of the end of Marvel.",negative

"Penelope Spheeris (of ""Wayne's World"" fame) made her mark with the documentary ""The Decline of Western Civilization"", about the LA punk scene in the late '70s and early '80s. Most of the documentary features interviews with the punks and footage of concerts (which often turn violent). Overall, we get to see how the punk movement was a reaction to the hippies: whereas the hippies were into being natural, the punks wanted to have themselves as altered as possible, what with spiked hair and all. But also, we see how they're really disaffected and sometimes becoming skinheads.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a really great time capsule. We're not really sure whether we want to long for that era or feel repulsed by it. But this is definitely not a documentary that will leave you neutral. Truly worth seeing.",positive

I think Brie did a good job, however I wish they would have worked in some more self deprecating jokes a la the last Thor movie, all the snarky comments without anyone saying anything made her character seem a bit stuck-up.

"I was waiting for this movie for a time. In the first day of the air in Turkey, I watched it. It was totally a disappointment for me. I was planning to watch a historical movie, but the one in the screen was a fictional one. First of all, the main character of the movie Cengiz Han, the great conquer was portrayed like a soft, calm, even a loser one. You can not feel the power in the movie. Historically, the war machine he created was conquered ¾ (even more) of the world know in those years. To do that, Cengiz first unite the Asian tribes. However, in the movie, this loser man is in one scene poor-alone man, and in second scene, he is commanding armies. War scenes were incredibly week. In the final battle, the Mongol horseman were using double swords on their sides and cutting the enemy. : ) As a consequences, me and my friends just laugh at that scenes. Mongol army means Mongol archery horseman. You can not see that in the movie. Another ill thing was the use of fantastic elements in the movie. I do not want to go into the scenes which was portrayed Cengiz as a prophet. We can say in the integrity of the movie, it is acceptable. However, the scenes when the old monk saw the future and go to find the wife of Cengiz Khan after Cengiz gave him a mission is really funny. When the monk died in the desert, Cengiz's wife feel this dead and she find the corpse in the continent. We are talking about the Asia Again we laughed.

"Just emailed a friend who's in film school about this flick. Something to avoid when making a film - characters blabbering senseless, overwrought, convoluted monologues on screen that are ultimately trite and unconvincing. If the film is an attempt at social realism, these verbal barrages are so over-the-top that they actually draw attention to the film constructed as film and effectively neutralize that intent. Is it the acting, or the script that is bad, or both?<br /><br />The protagonist is also highly unbelievable for social realism - ravenously consuming canonical English literature and the bible while high or hungover and able to produce such profoundly sophomoric soliloquies while intoxicated? And how is such an unattractive, unwashed and verbally noxious character able to bed most of the women he meets within minutes of encountering them? (I had to applaud when one chick finally threw him out onto the street, despite his whining and self-pitying banter).<br /><br />The viewer encounters pretentious references to Ancient Greek literature, Nostradamus and the Book of Revelations. The impending doom of mankind, in the form of bar codes imprinted on our foreheads or right hands in spooky biblical fashion, is presented to a character who is oh-so-cleverly exposed in his role as a guardian of empty space. <br /><br />This flick is over-scripted and over the top - a melodrama clumsily infused with pedestrian ""philosophy"" about the meaning of mankind, life, etc. It is trite, overwrought and tedious.<br /><br />There are some very fine English films available with content similar to this film. ""Nil by Mouth"" is an excellent, far more interesting excursion into the lives of individuals in a similar social milieu. Ditto for ""In the Warzone."" And although the comparison is not even warranted, check out anything by Peter Greenaway, who far more deftly handles dialogue, wit and absurd characters and situations.",negative
I went into this movie wanting to support Brie Larson but her acting was too bland. Really ruined the actual character of Captain Marvel.,negative
"Such high hopes were had for Captain Marvel, but fails on a promise to deliver much of anything. Mediocre to stale acting from Brie Larson to dull and unimaginative plot and story, this MCU movie is the most forgettable of the bunch. The whole point of the movie is to usher in Avengers: Endgame and that already gives it no leg to stand on. Had the writers had more faith in the movie and cared to write something palatable, then this would have been different. But here we are and you know it to be true. Captain Marvel was comparable to a mashed together 4 part filler episode arch from Agents of Shield, but that is being generous. If I were being straight... more like Agent Carter.",negative
"I'm a huge comic book and comic book media fan. I've followed all the changes for Captain Marvel from the beginning and I'm just really sad at how this movie fails on so many levels, it's more like a DC movie. Jackson is good of course, but Brie is just so unlikable in the movie, I don't know if that is how they wrote the character or what, but she has no real arc at all. The story is fairly confused other than being a metaphor for current US immigration policy, the real enemy is the patriarchy is what it seems like. Whoever wrote this had a really bizarre perspective on how dads interact with their daughters. I'm a single dad and everyone tells me what a great job I have done with my daughter, so I found it rather offensive. This is the biggest miss in the MCU as far as I can tell. i can watch any of the other movies again, and I don't believe I can ever watch this again. The story, the pacing, the main character, just a big miss all the way around, and don't get me started on how Fury loses his eye, what a missed opportunity",controversial
"For anyone who wishes to get an impression of the Soviet view of modern Russian history this monumental film is a treasure. The story starts at the turn of the century (1900) in the yellowish sepia colours of old photographs which improves to black and white during the middle of the century and to full colour when the story approaches modern times (i.e. the 1960s).<br /><br />The story focuses on a boy in a remote Siberian village, who is marked by the arrival and arrest of an anarchist during the czarist era. He later joins the Bolsheviks after the revolution and brings soviet communism to his village. His son, by the local beauty, fights the Germans during the Second World War. When he returns to the village, the oil industry takes off and we are treated to some Soviet economic idealism.<br /><br />This film is long and slow, but utterly logic and very well made.

"This was a terrible movie. Marvel was championed as a great hero for girls to rally around but because we never see a motivation for her as a character, she's unrelatable. All we see is Captain Marvel standing up when she could have stayed down. Thats not motivation, thats lazy writing. Furthermore, she's completely emotionless. Admittedly, thats something she has to 'overcome' throughout the film as a character but in her time on Earth, particularly as her memory returned, so to should her humanity and ability to feel. By the end of the film, the only difference is her power, she's the same character we see in the beginning and no, that's NOT a good thing. Furthermore, and this is one of the things that bugged me personally, was that she was completely unstoppablle in her powered state. Superman is championed as being super OP and unbeatable but that's not true (case in point: Man of Steel when he fought Zod). Captain Marvel had never flown before, (she figured that out instantly), she had no clue she could survive in space (she figured that out instantly), she had no idea she was virtually indesctrucible (she figured that out instantly). frankly, the 3rd act was a colossal let down to an otherwise bland movie. nnOh, and the feminism angle was terrible because it made all the male characters look useless. Fury was utterly powerless all throughout the film while in comparison to the comics, Fury was a war hero; the kind you'd send into the field to end the battle. Sure, he was against superior strength but that doesn't mean he wouldn't use both wit and skill to do more than escort the hostages at the end.   ",negative

Main character has no complexity or growth, a flat performance. One scene where she was repeating the same line over and over we laughed out loud because it was so flat. Was that part of the movie or the director trying to get some genuine emotion? nnI hope Endgame doesn't suffer from a forced and too much screen presence from this flat, generic superhero.",positive
"Refreshing solo movie without the tired tropes that recent Marvel movies have had. not too jokey, excellent tone, great acting from Larson and Jackson, actual heart, and finally some interesting cinematography.

All and all a decent movie worth seeing on the big screen, I saw it in Imax 2D. Will I see it twice? No, but I will happily watch it at least one more time on streaming. Oh yeah, and both end credit scenes are worth waiting for.",negative
"Good movie, enjoyable. I go into Marvel (and really any superhero) movies with the idea that they are eye candy and in that I got what I wanted, great scenes of action and some good comedy to boot. There was a bit of heavy-handedness with the ""girl-power"" motif but other than a scene with No Doubt's Just a Girl it wasn't too bad, and understandable as this is a female superhero icon so she SHOULD be about girl power. Not sure why so many people didn't like the movie.. sometimes I think that people are looking for the script to Shawshank Redmemption in a superhero movie, but sometimes you just have to sit back and enjoy yourself, as I did with this movie.",positive

I loved it, will definitely be going to see it again.",positive
"When I started the movie I was thinking the movie wouldnt be good but when I finished I loved it. It was the first mavel movie who had a woman as a main character.

"I loved the plot line and story arc for Captain Marvel, and the supporting characters were likeable and engaging. The humour was great but not inappropriately placed or out of tone with the rest of the movie. Favourite characters for sure are Fury and Maria. However, I don't know if its down to bad script writing or Brie Larson herself but the character of Captain Marvel did not capture my attention. At no point in the entire movie did I develop an interest in her character so when it came to the final showdown I just didn't care and CGI can only get you so hyped. Her character was bland and I could not jot down a single personality trait. She isn't a rogue soldier, she doesn't seem to have any emotions, and her chemistry with Fury is entirely one sided which is a shame because Fury tries really hard to give them that relationship. Overall I would have loved this movie if it had managed to make me feel for the main character at any point throughout it.",negative
"As a Westerner watching another culture's view and tradition of marriag, I found Just Married mesmerizing and delightful. The idea of marrying a stranger through the mutual arrangement of parents is difficult, especially in this modern age. Yet this is the case in this Hindi film. Told with humor, and fresh perspective, we learn of Abhay and Ritika who have only met once and are now on their traditional five day honeymoon. As said, it is difficult to believe in this cell phone affluent age that such an archaic custom as an arranged marriage still take place. We see the awkwardness that this young couple feels as they come together on their first night, and how they try to forge a bond, even though they do not know one another. We see different views of marriage and commitment as presented by the other couples also on holiday, from a couple of forty years married to others still unsure of making marital commitment. There's song, witty dialog, poignant moments, blending and comparison of new ways and tradition. Watching the movie with subtitles definitely loses some of the trueness of the story, yet it is still a delight to watch. Granted some of the plot is a little trite and the bus incident a bit drawn out and contrived; however the overall movie was worth watching.",positive
I liked it. No intersectional BS. The medium amount of struggle she overcame was representative of the kind universal to all humans. I'll put this movie in the top half of MCU movies. I won't have a final rating until after it releases to DVD and I've seen it several times.,positive

Overall a great movie to take my teen daughter to, but to seeing Captain Marvel again in Endgame? Meh.",positive

"For months I've been hearing about this little movie and now I've seen it. I find it cute, cute how so many fledgling directors make movies where they combine other people's creative ideas in order to make their own one-joke premise of a movie. Troops, Swingblade, any of the million Blair Witch parodies come to mind. If all that these directors want is a foot inside Hollywood's door then they're doing the right thing and they should keep it up because combining plot outlines is how Hollywood makes films. How many times have you heard the phrase, ""It's Animal House meets Back to the Future""; ""It's Wall Street meets Dead Poet's Society""; or ""Shakespeare in Love meets Star Wars""? I remember when independent films meant original and daring not safe and predictable.",negative

"Chen Kaige gives us magnificent depth of atmosphere. Yes, it's a 'period piece', but Chen's artistic use of imagery makes it something more. The actors often behave like players using the stylized diction, postures and facial expressions of Peking Opera. All the actors in a scene play to the 'back wall' even when addressing each other. They are like spirits of the past enunciating with powerful clarity a story with urgent meaning for those in the present.

"A very run of the mill film, contrary to what those who are hyping this film up are saying, the reviews saying it is mediocre are (in fact) the real reviews. As others have stated, Bries acting is very wooden, fury and goose are the most interesting parts of the film. It does have some good action scenes but for the most part there is no peril for this character that allows you to get behind her. A main point of this film is supposed to be how Carol has been oppressed by various people throughout her earth life and her kree life. We see in memories how people kept telling her she couldn't do things, in the early memories we see this causing her to fall, which is supposed to make us feel for her character but in the later, longer versions of those memories we see that the real reason she falls is her own fault, I.e. in the USAF she is teased for being stuck at the top of a rope and her reaction is to try to ""show them"" by swinging to the next rope leaping into a double back flip in the process and (unsurprisingly) failing to land it and falling to the floor. In another, whilst in a go kart, she is teased for going too slow and promptly floors the accelerator, the result being that she is going far faster than she can handle and of course she crashes. I'm sorry but this creates no sympathy for her and smashes any narrative they are trying to push. As for the Kree "" holding her back"" I have to say that what they do actually makes perfect sense when it comes to restricting her powers. They encounter a being who has absorbed and unknown energy and as a result has developed super powers, powers that are accessed through emotion. This being, it can be assumed (rather safely I might add), has virtually zero control over their emotions and having no idea how powerful they might be, the Kree fit them with an inhibitor. Bearing in mind when we first meet carol/vers it has been 6 years since she got her powers, that she has been in combat and emotional control training for the entire time. Despite this, it is made clear that she loses control over the slightest frustration and it is no wonder the Kree do not feel willing to free her from those restrictions just yet. Her mentor (Jude Law) is supposed to be seen as another vile person who is holding her back, yet to anyone who can see past the shallow ideology presented it is obvious that he is in fact trying to help her to learn how to control her emotions, with the goal being that they will finally remove the inhibitor. The fact that he points out that if she were able to control her emotions she wouldn't need to be restricted in her use of her powers merely confirms this. There are some good buddy cop humour scenes between Carol and Fury, but these are few and I feel the film would have benefited from more of these moments. We see a young Nick Fury who is new to the whole ""aliens are real"" thing but we can see the beginnings of the Fury we know and love, plus his scenes with Goose are entertaining, especially when he learns what Goose really is. The end credit scenes are the only part of this film that tie in to endgame, so if that's all you're interested in I'd recommend looking them up on google as there's not much else in this film for you. On the whole it's OK but nowhere near amazing or the best movie ever or whatever else the hypers are claiming. It is a bog standard origin movie that is made forgettable as our hero is never truly in any danger and there is no epic final battle, just a rather laughable scene where she is challenged to a fair fight and she declines this in an ""im not taking orders from you"" moment that just compounds the view that she is an arrogant, self opinionated and wholly unrelatable character. Best score I can give is 5/-, definitely not worth the hype. One to keep for a rainy day or if there's nothing else on at the cinema",negative
"Marvel Studios has yet to make a bad movie and Captain Marvel is no exception.  Entertaining and with a positive message, the casual MCU fan will be entertained.  Unfortunately, weak writing (gaping plot holes, poorly timed jokes, and retconning key aspects of the character's origin and other Marvel lore) place this somewhere in between Thor: The Dark World and Iron Man 2 in the MCU library.  Stan Lee cameo and mid-credits scenes are worth the price of admission.  Jackson, Mendelhson, and Law give great performances.  Brie Larson gives a solid performance considering the writing problems and limited range afforded her character.  Not as bad as many are saying but not a MCU tentpole either.",negative

"GINGKO BED is a strange movie. It's very convoluted, as if it had a lot of ideas but lacked the ability to bring them all into one coherent story. Instead, we get various plotlines that diverges into their own separate little movies. Oh sure, they eventually meet up in the end, but it all seems rather...superfluous. Of note is the girlfriend and her troubles at the hospital. Was this...interesting? Then there were the ""we are spirits, thus we have no physicality"" elements, which leads to the same problem that people had with GHOST, namely: If the characters have no physicality (i.e. no corporeal form) and they can phase through walls and what not, how exactly do they keep from falling through the floor, or float up the ceiling for that matter?<br /><br />GINGKO BED was highly touted as a new breed of South Korean film.

It was a great movie. You can definitely tell that it was directed with the female audience in mind because a lot of the humor that comes from Captain Marvel is subtle and revolves around the sexism women face every day. It might be more difficult for men to pick up on the nuances unless they are knowledgeable of the issues women deal with. This may explain why some people think the first half of the movie is dry. The second half of the movie contains more action and a hilarious Nick Fury. I absolutely adored this film and I hope the guys out there who didn't like the movie understand that how they feel is exactly how a lot of women feel when they watch the dozens of superhero movies created with a male audience in mind. Just because it wasn't geared towards your tastes doesn't automatically make it bad.,positive

"Spoiler Free: The plot had no structure whatsoever. In the beginning, you are thrown into unfamiliar cultures and the dense lore of two races of aliens. There is no pacing in between the sporadic deliveries of history. The protagonist's backstory is expanded upon throughout the movie, but they fail to provide any amount of understanding of purpose. They failed to give the main character motivation in the audiences' eyes. The rules of storytelling state that a character's motivation is paramount for story progression and without it, a story turns into a boring series of events. If that wasn't bland enough, the plot progression stayed in Act 1 twice as long as it should have, and Act 3 was way to rushed. They tried to show off how powerful Captain Marvel is in the final fight, but it came off unrealistic and much too flashy. The MCU is going to have difficulty scaling her power down in Avengers 4 and following team ups. While I wasn't satisfied enough with the amount of fight scenes there were, they were still excellent and I did end up enjoying that much. Also important to note that they nailed the comedy in this movie. It could be said that there was too much humor, but in my personal opinion, the excessive comedy spiced up the otherwise boring movie it was. I'm still happy for Captain Marvel finally being made, regardless. She's been one of my favorites for a while and they did her surface level characteristics well. Very strong and bold. I will definitely never watch Captain Marvel 1 again but I have high hopes that the sequel wall be better and I am ecstatic to see her in Avengers End Game. ",negative

"For a film being slotted between two of the biggest MCU movie releases, it left a lot to be desired. The hype for this movie overshadowed its execution.

"Normally I am a typical ""creepy-crawly-hatin'"" girl, but after watching this film (on YouTube of course), I'm having different perspectives. And also I did not know that my favorite animation studio - Fleischer's made another film that's about community of insects whose city garden home is threatened by humans (lighted cigars and cigarette butts,footsteps,etc.), and how a plucky young grasshopper named Hoppity saves the day and wins the heart of Honey the bee; I love the lovely Ms. Honey. You know, after watching the film, the bugs reminded me of the some of the ""jitter-bugs"" from Don Bulth's Thumbelina. And out of the songs in the film, I love ""We're a Couple in The Castle;"" when I sing that song, it almost made me cry.<br /><br />This wonderful film was the second (and final) feature to come out of the Fleischer studio. The film was originally going to be released on November of 1941, but since the Fleischer's rival, Disney, released Dumbo weeks earlier, Paramount changed the date to December of the same year, but Mr. Bug unfortunately went into a, then unrealized, trap of terrible timing. Having the misfortune of opening two days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Mr. Bug was a financial disaster and led to the ousting of Max and Dave Fleischer, from the studio they had established in 1919, and reorganized the company as Famous Studios. Another huge factor in their departure was the fact that Max and Dave Fleischer were no longer speaking to one another due to disputes (how sad it was). Overall I love both films from the Fleischer bros. - Gulliver and Mr. Bug.",positive

"Captain Marvel is not the feminist franchise-killer some feared it would be. However, it is hardly the empowering masterpiece some expected either. In reality, this feels like a phase one movie more than anything, with a worrying reliance on the played-out stock origin story formula. Whilst we twist involving the Skulls does work, the retcons of Nick Fury and the Tesseract end up as either convoluted or plain annoying. Samuel L Jackson and Ben Mendhelson are excellent as ever, but Brie Larson is rather wooden and unlikeable, with her character flaws having no consequences or impact on the plot, making her feel like a sulky, petulant teenager who hasn't been disciplined properly. The CGI is also an incredibly mixed, ranging from realistic to PS4 cutscene. However, there are some redeeming qualities: there are some good laughs and action, even though the final fight irritatingly looks like it was filmed by a GoPro attached to a frantic squirrel. Stop using unnecessary shaky-cam, Hollywood! The skulls look fantastic and there are some good points about refugees and trust. However, the movie just feels average when compared to the more creative and recent Marvel movies, and stalls as much as it soars. With Endgame coming up, this film just feels like the prelude it is, hinting at the glory to come but not sharing it. nOn the surface, it's an entertaining movie that wastes two hours of your free time in an enjoyable manner. However, Marvel needs to try far harder if they are going nto introduce more heroes. ""Captain Marvel"" is a movie that is just there, not the ground-breaker that was ""Wonder Woman"", but hardly the dismal origin story that some feared.",controversial

Some very good jokes, but also some that not everybody seemed to get.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like were the voices of Astérix and Obélix, in the German version at least. The voice actors are very well-known around here, which was the only reason they were casted, really. They don't fit the characters at all.<br /><br />All in all, a good way to spend some time (and if it's free, like in my case, all the better) and to have a couple of laughs. 8 out of 10.",positive

"This is a wonderful look, you should pardon the pun, at 22 women talking about breasts-- theirs, their mothers', other women's, and how they affect so many aspects of their lives. Young girls, old women, and everyone in between (with all shapes, sizes, configurations, etc) talk about developing, reacting, celebrating, hiding, enhancing, or reducing their breasts.<br /><br />It's charming, delightful, sad, funny, and everything in between. Intercut with documentary footage and clips from those famous old ""young women's films"" that the girls got taken to the cafeteria to see, the interviews are a fascinating window for men who love women & their breasts into what the other half has to say when they don't know you're listening.",positive
"An average MCU movie.nThe good:n- The banter between the characters is classic marvel light humor.n- Good effects and decent fight scenes.n- An original take on telling an origin story.n- The freaking cat is probably the best part of the movie.n- The main story I thought was decent.nnThe okay:n- Her backstory is okay. It clearly has a feminist trope of her being put down because she's a woman and she overcomes it. I won't say it's bad, but I don't think it's a great story of growth when compared to other origin story'sn- Fury's role is a bit of a let down. He has moments I would expect from a future Shield director, but at the same time needs to get rescued a lot. You could argue he's still new to the whole alien powers situation, but he's Fury so I disagree.n- The music choices, although nostalgic and in place with the 90's, don't always fit with the scene and can be distracting at times.nnThe bad:n- It's hard to read Brie. She had good banter with Fury, but some of her lines fall flat or her emotions don't always line up with how you think she should react.n- Marvel's power is hard to gauge. Sometimes she's taken out by a taser, sometimes she's not. Sometimes she can fight without her powers, sometimes she can't.

"This movie is one for the ages. First, I have to say after seeing this once, it became one of my all-time favorite movies. Why? Simple; Ben Coccio (writer, director)has put together a true piece of art. Where 99.9% of movies these days are purely entertainment, director Ben Coccio gives us truth, gives us reality, gives us a learning tool to know why this happened. The mainstream media spins and spins but Ben Coccio looks school shootings right in the face, able to go where no other form of media has EVER gone before, into the minds and hearts of two young men planning to kill their classmates. While it surely is graphic and horrifying, how couldn't it be? The gloves come off, the lies and the sugar coating of our media masters is brushed aside and we are taken to a place where we can find truth in what happened. Sometimes it isn't just a screw loose like everyone likes to think, no, sometimes hatred and isolation are deeper, are more human, we are shown that these boys are us and we them. Society left them behind and the consequences are horrifying and real.<br /><br />Respect and love your fellow man. A lesson we all should learn, thank you so much for making this film Mr. Coccio, I hope with great anticipation that you will continue your film-making career.",positive

The special effects are pretty silly, mostly consisting of skulls on wires and superimposed ""ghost"" images.<br /><br />But there's something to be said for the sets. The large mansion in which it takes place is pretty creepy, especially since it's mostly unfurnished (probably due to budgetary reasons?).<br /><br />It definitely inspires more laughs than screams, however.

"The most interesting thing about Miryang (Secret Sunshine) is the actors. Jeon Do-yeon, as Lee Shin-ae, the main character, is a woman with a young son whose husband has died in a tragic accident, and who leaves Seoul to live in Miryang, which was his home town, with her young son. Jeon's face is very changeable. She is girlish, flirtatious, elegant, aged and sad, desperate and joyous, with it and terribly isolated by turns, and it's all in her face. The film also stars Song Kang-ho as Kim, a man who meets her when her car breaks down coming into Miryang, who happens to run a garage in town, and who follows her around all the time thereafter, despite her apparent lack of interest in his attentions. Song is the biggest star in Korea right now, renowned for his work with Park Chan-wook and Bong Joon-ho (Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance; Memories of Murder and The Host). And yet here he plays a throwaway character, almost a forgotten man. But of course he makes him interesting and curiously appealing. He is the essential ballast to keep Jeon's character from floating away.<br /><br />Lee Shin-ae is a piano teacher. She comes to the new town, which is a neutral place, a kind of poor-man's Seoul, a town ""just like anywhere else,"" as Kim says (just as he is in a way just like anyone else). Her little boy is sprightly, as little boys are, but plainly damaged and withdrawn at times too. His father used to snore, and when he misses him he lies awake, pretending to snore. He goes to school, and Shin-ae meets parents and students and shopkeepers. There is a sense of place in the film, even though the place is in a sense ""anywhere."" People speak in the local dialect, and everyone knows everything, and Shin-ae's Seoul origin is immediately noticed. Is life really harsher here, away from the big city and its sophistication? Shin-ae seems not to realize the danger she is in.<br /><br />Something terrible happens. And Shin-ae doesn't necessarily deal with it in the best possible way. But it happens and she must face the consequences. But she can't. She goes to pieces. A perpetrator is caught, but that's no consolation. Eventually she becomes so despairing, she relents and goes to a born-again Christian meeting an acquaintance has been pressing her to attend. She finds peace and release with this. But when she decides not only to forgive the perpetrator but to go to the prison to tell him so, that experience is full of ironies and it destroys her all over again. She becomes embittered and desperate and she no longer finds solace in religion. And it gets worse than that.<br /><br />Jeon Do-yeon gives her all in this extremely demanding and protean role. Lee Chang-dong may be a very good director. If an actor of the stature of Song Kang-ho expresses enormous admiration for him, that is convincing. According to Scott Foundas of LA Weekly, Lee's first three films, Green Fish (1997), Peppermint Candy (2000) and Oasis (2002) have marked him out as ""one of the leading figures of his country's recent cinematic renaissance."" But this is not as successful a film as those of other Korean directors whose work I've seen, such as Yong Sang-Soo, Bong Joon-ho, and the prodigiously, almost perversely gifted Park Chan-wook. It may indeed begin as Foundas says as a kind of ""Asiatic Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" and then ""abruptly and without warning"" turns into ""something of a thriller, and some time after that a nearly Bressonian study in human suffering."" But that progression not only seems random and indigestible; the film sags and loses its momentum toward the end and then simply fizzles out, with no sense of an ending. There are also weaknesses in the action. Shin-ae takes foolish chances with her son, and makes bad choices all along. If she is destined for madness like Betty in Jean-Jacques Beineix's Betty Blue, which might explain her peculiar and mistaken choices, that isn't something that is properly developed. This is an interesting film, certainly a disturbing one, but one that leaves one doubtful and dissatisfied, after putting one through an emotional wringer.<br /><br />An official selection of the New York Film Festival presented at Lincoln Center, 2007an event that has done right by Korean filmmakers in the recent past.",positive
"I never intended to see Venom, but I caught it on cable. It does have good elements. The Louisiana swamp atmosphere for one, something we will unfortunately not see so much of in movies because of Hurricane Katrina. It is based on an interesting concept, a regular man imbued with the spirits of evil. His confrontation with his son could have been interesting, as could much of the movie. But as tends to happen in Hollywood, an interesting idea goes down a familiar direction: <br /><br />Kill off all the characters save the good girl, starting with the Black guys. I'm a fan of Agnes Bruckner, but the other characters, the villain's afore-mentioned son, CeCe who must become a voodoo priestess, are more interesting. And for the love of God, just once I would like to see the virgin get killed. We all like the easy girl, why can't she live?

I can't tell what's going on until I get a medium shot. Too many close ups. It's cool that her powers come from the a stone. Shows why she's so powerful and I buy it. Goose steals the movie. Final act: Saw the twist coming a mile away. Ben Mendelson is a great actor. Jude Law is just being himself. Writing is still dumb. I'm having fun. Larson is still bad at acting but she does get to show some skill with her physical acting. Helps a lot. I forgot about her friends daughter. She rules. Better actress than Larson in this. Anyway, bing bang boom. Explosions and Larson is flying and she's really dope. I like this part a lot. Writing still bad. Fury lost his eye to Goose. I like that it's a dumb reason.

Somehow, One-Hit Wonder Zwick manages a film that simultaneously offends Elvis fans, Mary Kay saleswomen, Las Vegas, gays, FBI agents and the rest of humanity with any intelligence with a shoddy, sloppy farce so forced it deserves to be forsaken ed. How Elvis Presley Enterprises could allow the rights of actual Elvis songs to be used in a film with a central premise that seems to be ""The only good Elvis Presley Imitator is a dead one"" is beyond me. The worst part of this mess - and that takes some work - is the mangled script: In 1958, Elvis' words and songs that he would speak/perform in the 1970's are quoted! Worst special effect? That Oscar would go to the moron who decided that Elvis' grave, potentially the most photographed/recognizable grave in the world, resembles a pyramid with a gold record glued atop and is situated in the middle of a park somewhere. Potentially, this film's biggest audience would be Elvis fans.

The only thing I can admire is the acting of some characters. The movie was too bright, they should have done something with the lighting, eg. making the environment more darker. The make up on certain dead characters made this movie look like a 1970 horror flick. This is 2006! People don't get scared by other people wearing heavy make up. Most of the horror scenes we're taken from other Hollywood or Asian horror movies. Total rip off! This is why I don't watch tagalog movies.

"End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen. Muddling direction, meandering script loaded with lame dialogues and gaping plot holes, rapid-fire MTV-style editing and poor acting all the way.<br /><br />That's not to say End of Days isn't watchable. The movie kept me interested because I found Ah-nuld's latest action flick laughably stupid for being so inept and silly when it comes to logic. Without the sense of logic the movie dies quicker, which is why End of Days deserved a huge drop of box office reception in its second week after the opening in the U.S.<br /><br />I won't go into the details explaining why End of Days violates the law of movie logic, but here are several problems with this movie:<br /><br />(SPOILER)<br /><br />After the Devil walks out, the restaurant explodes without any trace as to how he did it. No snapping finger, no tampered energy gas to ignite the fire, nothing. How could this happen?<br /><br />Arnold and his annoying sidekick Kevin Pollack somehow magically comes up with the name ""Christine York"" after examining the phrase ""Christ in New York"" carved on a victim's body, runs the database on the computer and, viola, Christine York, the only person with the exact name in all of New York City! Beyond my suspension of disbelief. <br /><br />How did the characters who have come in contact with Arnold's character turn against him later in the movie? I laughed out loud when I recognized the good-stepmother-turned-evil-stepmother is the same actress who played a nanny in William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet. Her ironic transition from that film to this was absolutely hilarious if you can imagine.<br /><br />All the mindlessly huge explosions and gunfires. What did you expect in the Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle?<br /><br />The Devil took a man's body comprising of flesh and blood, yet he's invisible to bullets and explosions by healing through that body. Logically, this is impossible.<br /><br />As the Devil demostrates the illusion in the apartment, Arnold's character runs into the solid Christmas tree that supposedly is an illusion and *falls on it* physically.<br /><br />The Devil is capable of punching the person's brains out and twisting a victim's head 180 degree, yet he could not kill Arnold's character as he always intends to.<br /><br />How the Devil's object of desire's parents died and why evil New Yorkers run after Arnold and the object of desire were never explained at all.<br /><br />In the sequence that's a rip-off of Speed, Arnold and the Devil's object of desire manage to escape the subway train wreck by the short distance inside unscathed. This is beyond my comprehension, since the force would be enough to throw Arnold and the object of desire around violently and die from fatal wounds seconds after impact.<br /><br />Arnold suffers the brutal beating from the mob sanctioned by the Devil and put him on the cross to hang against the wall, yet the Devil forgot to take the time and opportunity to kill him for convenience's sake.<br /><br />At the beginning of the movie, after the Devil took over a man's body, all of a sudden Arnold is his bodyguard??? Is this a coincidence or just an example of bad editing?<br /><br />Arnold's recital of cringe-inducing dialogues in the particularly laughable scenes like ""YOU ARE A CHOIRBOY COMPARED TO ME!"" are the perfect fodder for MST3K, just as Eraser did with the classic line ""You're the luggage!"".<br /><br />The whole theory about 666/1999 is downright ludicrous. So are the pseudo-religious babble about the Christian theology involving the end of the world at precisely midnight and the fanatic killers who know the location of the Devil's object of desire. <br /><br />(END SPOILERS)<br /><br />It is highly ironic that End of Days uses the scattered profanities abusing the deity while rambling about Christian theories. The level of violence in the film is excessive and gruesome, and is therefore unnecessary to serve the plot. The director's indulgence of excess is a factor here. He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.<br /><br />Hence, End of Days is a worthless film with no redeeming value except for campiness -- Arnold's worst since Hercules in New York. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />",negative

"Personally, I believe that this film has been receiving too much grief simply as a result of the incredibly high quality of many recent Marvel projects.nnWhile the film does present several issues, primarily related to poor pacing and preachy exposition, I find it to be a solid film (and by no means Marvel's weakest effort).  Brie Larson came across as likable and as real as a space-warrior-hero could be.  While I found her character and the script to be a bit stoic and inorganic at times, I find it to be somewhat consistent to the source material, which makes that easier to swallow.  Samuel Jackson is solid as Nick Fury, and I will say that the tech used to reverse his aging is miles better than anything I've seen over the last several years in the Star Wars Universe.  Jude Law is great, however, I feel like the film fails to make viewers care much about his existence.nnFor me, Ben Mendelsohn as Talos is the biggest surprise, and most redeemable quality of the film.  His performance is fun, and for me, he picked up the film and carried it to the finish.",positive
"""Captain Marvel"" was meant to be a water divider in the Marvel universe, but it's just an ordinary movie, the new heroine that came to be a differential in endless war and leading the hero troop is not exciting, but there are cool things. With a script of origin, which is not boring, it is even fun and uses screen resources to tell its story, full of acid criticism the position of the woman, but the script presents controversial to the already established universe of Marvel, show important events that we had not yet seen in movies silly.nnBrie Larsson is not bad at the show, but is far from being the great actress who knows, Samuel Jackson is very well.

"The movie, surprisingly, didn't have an overtly feminist message, like Wonder Woman did. It wasn't about a woman being a woman and wooping bad guys. It was about a hero wooping bad guys, gender unimportant. Really, I can think of only one scene where her gender is involved, and it's played for laughs. The character herself barely notes it. Honestly, that scene is more a call-back to Terminator 2 than Wonder Woman.nnSo no big social message about gender. What it does have is satisfying action, fun humor, and an intriguing plot with good twists. It's a good entry into superhero movies, which as my favorite genre, earns it 4 stars.",controversial

"One of the better kung fu movies, but not quite as flawless as I had hoped given the glowing reviews. The movie starts out well enough, with the jokes being visual enough that they translate the language barrier (which is rarer than you'd think for this era) and make the non-fight dialogue sequences passable (for a kung fu movie, this is a great compliment). Unlike other Chinese action movies, which were always period pieces or (in the wake of Jackie Chan's Police Story I) cop dramas, Pedicab Driver gives us a look at contemporary rural China. Unfortunately, in the latter 1/3 of the movie it takes a nosedive into dark melodrama tragedy which I thought was unnecessary.<br /><br />The action is overall good, featuring a duel between Sammo and 1/2 of the Shaw Brothers' only 2 stars, Kar-Leung Lau and then a fight at the end with that taller guy who always plays Jet Li's bad guy. There's only 20 minutes of combat here, which is standard, but what annoys me is the obvious speeding up of the camera frames. I get that they have to film half speed to avoid hurting each other, but there are smooth edits and then there's this. It really takes away from the fights when it's this obvious the footage was messed with.<br /><br />That said, if you like kung fu movies, my opinion here won't dissuade you, and if you don't, you just wasted 2 minutes of your life reading this.",positive
"This is a really sad, and touching movie! It deals with the subject of child abuse. It's really sad, but mostly a true story, because it happens everyday.

While living with her parents, a man, who likes to be called ""The King"" comes into their life. He hits the youngest boy, Bobby, but the two brothers vow not to tell their mother.

"First I am a teenager. OK, and I have to say this movie was pretty good. I think any kid ten and under will like it, but people my age an up might be a little, um, a, well, we'd describe the movie as LAME! But I liked it. It may be that I still act like a kid, or I visit a cattle farm every weekend, but this movie was cute. I did like how the actors were like kids, not little blonde cutesy pies, wearing three layers of clothes, a trendy hat, and about a thousand assecories (like most shows today, to name a few, Drake & Josh, Lizzie Mc Guire, well any kid show.) And the setting was perfect, but there was a flaw. The family was in debt, right? Why in the world did their internal house look like something out of a ""western"" versace store? That was one flaw.<br /><br />The cameos are great, there's about five hundred of them, and the only explainable one is Julia Roberts being the main little girl's aunt. How in the world did they get everyone else? This movie seemed to be on a tight type budget.<br /><br />I liked this movie, it was a fun one to watch, and I thought some parts were far fetched (Like a cow selling for $750,000? Ha! my butt a cow sells for that much!) But otherwise it was good, I liked it, and I could watch it again. But I'd never buy it, there's not even special features on the DVD! What's up with that?

"I was really hoping this movie would surprise me. I thought maybe the trailers were hiding all the good parts of the film, but the film was just as boring as the trailers. It had a promising start, but it progressively got less interesting. Halfway through the movie comes to a complete stand still, like the part of Age of Ultron where the Avengers stop at hawkeye's house, and the movie drags on.nnBrie Larson doesn't have that larger-than-life charisma that we've come to expect from a Marvel film. Her performance lacked personality except for a few scenes in the beginning. She didn't have a presence that exudes power and confidence like one would expect from such a powerful character that's supposedly going to lead the MCU going forward. Her performance was bland overall, and she paled in comparison to the MCU veterans in the credits scene. When Captain Marvel unlocks her full powers, she immediately masters them, becoming overpowered and easily destroying her adversaries. Personally, I think a movie about her learning to use and control her new powers would've made for a more interesting plot. The CGI in the final battle was terrible.nnSamuel L Jackson was as good as ever, although playing a much goofier Nick Fury than usual. There is a reveal about his missing eye that is eye-rollingly bad. Nick Fury's one-liners about his eye have lost all of their toughness, all for the sake of a quick joke that falls flat. It reminds me of when Disney decided to show how Han Solo got his name, and it bothers me just as much.nnLashana Lynch nailed it. Easily the best performance in the film. Would've liked to see her have more screen time.nnBen Mendelsohn was also fantastic. There's no doubt he enjoyed playing this role and he gave it his all.nnGoose the cat didn't impress me. It was obvious when Goose was CGI. An event involving Goose breaks MCU continuity in a major way.nnOver all, the movie was boring. The theater was mostly silent and some people were asleep. The movie suffered from a thin plot that probably didn't need to be stretched out to two hours, a bland protagonist with no character arc, and a bland visual style. If anyone can make this character interesting it's the Russo Brothers.",negative

Current pretty-boy Hardy Kruger Jr --possibly more handsome than his dad-- is featured as Weller's arrogant boss in a horrifying sequence at a chemical production plant which gets the story moving. Natasha McElhone is a slightly wacky government agent looking into the incident who provides inevitable & high-cheekboned love interest for hero Hurt.

Brie Larson's boring portrayal of Captain America destroyed all of my expectations. I can list dozens of other actresses with more emotion and acting ability who could have carried this movie much further. The director didn't seem to have watched any of the MCU movies considering the inconsistencies. The way Carol received her powers didn't make any sense at all. Changing Mar-Vell's gender was unnecessary and felt very forced. Making Marvel the 'most powerful' Avenger doesn't make any sense and 'the speed of light technology' giving her that ability makes even less sense. And they mis-used the Skrull. Worst movie of the MCU franchise so far and worst Marvel movie since Daredevil. ,negative

"In my never-ending quest to see as many quality movies as possible in my lifetime, i stumbled upon this film on cable. I tried Hitchcock three times before this, and never have i felt that the man's work lived up to the praise he had received. I always felt he was good, not great (from what I've seen) This was the best of his films I've seen thusfar. Robert Walker is absolutely chilling, his performance takes the film where Hitchcock wanted it to go. Even an average performance here damages the overall product. My favorite scene was his obsession about getting the lighter from the drain (how exactly does he get his arm down there though?) Bruno is quite a compelling character, but i also loved the performance by Patricia Hitchcock as Barbara. The rest of the Morton family as well as Guy were a bit dry and boring, but she added some flare to the movie, as well as having some of the better lines in the script.<br /><br />Lastly, in any suspense movie, you're going to live and die by your ending. This one holds water, unlike a couple other Hitchcock films I've seen. I truly was unsure of how it would end, which kept me on the edge while i watched and waited.",positive

"Probably the most disappointing Marvel movie. The biggest issue of the film is probably Captain Marvel herself, as she's sloppily written, not relate-able, and not in the slightest bit interesting. The is the same with all the characters, as the movie moves way to quick and dedicates almost no time to developing characters so that we the audience can care. And, if I don't care, then what's the point of following them on their journey? The only redeeming qualities to the movie are Ben Mendelsohn's and Samuel L. Jackson's performances, the score, and of course, Goose the cat. Overall, Captain Marvel is probably the worst film in the franchise.nGrade: D+",negative

"Mild spoilers below.<br /><br />The prospect of war was clearly on the horizon when TFW was filmed. From the opening scene of European refugees to the final prediction that Naziism will be the death of millions of Germans, this movie is as much a propaganda film as the films made after Pearl Harbor. There isn't a lot of entertainment value here though the footage of the dust bowl is interesting to those of us who aren't old enough to remember it. The rest of the plot is pretty forgettable with the Herr Docktor Coburn - with a pretty bad accent - and daughter assimilating into America with Wayne's help. Other than the dust bowl scenes, the only memorable aspect of the movie is one best viewed with hindsight. Coburn's speech comparing Naziism to a malignancy worse than cancer and describing the (then current) successes as a momentary outburst of energy from a patient right before death were eerily accurate and Varno's Dr. Scherer played accurately to post war newsreel footage of unrepentant Nazis justifying their actions.<br /><br />When viewed from a historical perspective, some aspects of TFW are interesting. If you look at it for entertainment outside of the WWII perspective, you'd have to say this is one of Wayne's less successful efforts.",negative

"5/- - Nothing in this movie stands out as great. It seems as if the runtime was 30 minutes longer than it actually ended up being, due to a lack of action scenes until the end, and even when the action scenes came in, they were still somewhat boring. Brie Larson wasn't necessarily bad, just a little bland. That may not necessarily be her fault, as her character may have been written to be mainly monotone most of the way through, but it overall created for a pretty dragging performance. There were some redeemable qualities about this film, mainly special effects. The anti-aging cgi used on Samuel L. Jackson to make him look younger is definitely very impressive, and the visual effects are much better than other somewhat recent marvel films, such as Black Panther. Not a bad movie, just a sort of bland film that begins to drag towards the third act.",negative

"Prisons are not exactly renowned for their kind hospitality and 'happy vibes', what with stories of fights, chaos, murder and of course extreme male bonding! But the prison in this film is a different beast altogether. Horror films set in cells are, as you probably know, nothing particularly new as they emphasis and exaggerate the fear of claustrophobia and the inability of escape  two of the greatest themes in horror cinema. With such examples as THE CHAIR (Waldermar Korzeniowsky, 1988), THE GREEN MILE (Frank Darabont, 1999), ALIEN 3 (David Fincher, 1992)and of course the entire Women In Prison exploitation genre itself, another entry into this niche has to be something inventive and a lot of fun to boot in order to be recognised. Or at least that's what you'd have thought. PRISON is certainly an incredibly fun and enjoyable ride and it's somewhat of a shame that it isn't as well known as it should be.<br /><br />The film, in short, centres on an old prison (well, duh!) which has been reopened. However, it's not just fellow inmates and guards the prisoners have to fear, but also a mean ass demon ghost spirit with only one thing on its mind; death! And boy, are we treated to some awesome death scenes! I won't spoil anything here for you but there are plenty of innovative and enjoyable murders all done by invisible hands.<br /><br />Besides the special effects and the murders, this film also has another thing going for it; it's cast. Headlining, we have LORD OF THE RINGS (Peter Jackson, 2001-2003) star Viggo Mortensen (and for all those so inclined, yes, he does get naked) whose performance is not only highly believable, but is done with such skill that his Eastwood-esquire character is both bad-to-the-bone and likable (a very delicate mix). Add him to a cast of 'hey-wait-a-minute-I-know-that-guy' actors and you've got yourself one great set of stars. The characters themselves however lack three-dimensionality and more often than not come across as very stereotypical. We've got a black oculist, a hard-as-nails prison warden, a human-rights activist woman and plenty of other stock characters. But in all honesty, this 'fault' actually aids the film. Instead of boring character development in an over-long equilibrium, we are chucked, more or less, straight into the action and once it gets going (very early on) there's not a single scene that's a filler  it's balls to the wall plot. Unlike a certain SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (Frank Darabont, 1994 )! Sharing conventions with the slasher genre, this is somewhat of a convention itself, and, in good ol' slasher genre tradition, PRISON punishes those who have been bad.<br /><br />All in all this is an excellent little horror film and one which is sadly overlooked and unmentioned among the horror world. With an excellent cast and great special effects and rather original death scenes this film is highly recommended to horror fans. Don't be fooled into thinking it'll be a cheesy little film either, just because it was made in USA 1980s, it's far from cheesy (although the very end does ruin this) and, simultaneously, far from gritty and realistic (whilst it attempts to tackle issues such as prison rape, these are rather subtly done).<br /><br />I give it 3.5 out of 5 luvs. A very entertaining horror film with some very nice touches indeed.",positive

With modern technology to improve old archival footage and lots of information that has been unearthed since 1974 when The World At War was produced, an updated version of this series would be welcome.

"SPOILERS Every major regime uses the country's media to it's own ends. Whether the Nazi banning of certain leaflets, or the televised Chinese alternative of Tianamen Square, Governments have tried to influence the people through different mediums since the beginning of time. In 1925 though, celebrating the failed mutiny of 1905, the Russian Communist Government supported the creation of this film, Battleship Potempkin. A major piece of cinematic history, it remains powerful and beautiful to this very day.<br /><br />Set aboard the Battleship Potempkin, the crew are unhappy. In miserable living conditions and with maggot infested food, they are angry at their upper class suppressors. Now though, after the rotten food, enough is enough. Led by Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov), the crew turn upon their masters and fight for their freedom.<br /><br />As far as propaganda goes, ""Battleship Potempkin"" is perfect. Presenting a positive light on the first, unsuccessful, communist mutiny, the film was a useful Soviet tool. Eighty years after the films release though, and the USSR has disappeared completely off the map. The amazing thing about this film though is that whilst the country it's message was intended for has disappeared, the film remains a powerful and worthy piece of cinema.<br /><br />Written and directed by Sergei Eisenstein, the film is surprisingly a joy to watch. It is true, that it is far from what we would nowadays consider 'entertainment', but the film is a beautiful piece of art.<br /><br />Whether it be the scenes aboard the boat or the often talked about scene on the steps of Odessa, everything about this film is perfectly made. The music is powerful and dramatic, the lighting is flawless, even the acting, whilst slightly overdone, is perfect for the piece. Basically, there is no way to fault this film's end product.<br /><br />It's impossible to know how the Russian people received this film upon it's release. Praising a country which has not existed for fifteen years, it's difficult for us to know the full spirits that the film inspires. As a piece of art though, it is magnificent. Beautiful from start to finish, it is far from an easy watch, but it is well worth the effort.",positive
"So wow. This may rank down there in the MCU with either of the first two Thor movies in my book. I was hoping the poor fan reviews were just haters from some of the comments attributed to Brie Larson but alas no. Totally disjointed, complete lack of character/relationship development, corny, and on Brie Larson's part (may have been written that way however) there was total absence of emotional/acting range. I was totally bummed with the movie but still it's not terrible. Girl songs abound and alien/cat goofiness this will be fun for little girls. Hopefully Captain Marvel kicks butt in the Avenger's movie next month. This one she served up a dud. ",controversial
"Very good movie with few flaws here and there. There're questions about a few thing, but movie is very good overall.",positive
"NOT VERY GOOD, besides all of the political and feministic drama behind this movie lies a broken, shambled, mess of a movie. Brie Larson may be a good actor but does no justice to the character of captain marvel, this be do to a lack of character direction in how the movie was written. The supporting cast may be the best part of the movie, Samuel L Jackson does a good joob as usual with the de-aging cgi on him probably may be the best we've seen. Ben Mendolsohn also is great as Talos a Skroll (shapeshifting alien race introduced in the film) as well as Lashana Lynch as Maria Rambo Carol Danvers (Captian marvels) best freind. But that is the end of good things I have to say, their are many plotholes that a casual marvel fan may be confused by like he lack of explanation of how Mar-Vel got holds of the tesseract after Sheild re-attained at the end of Captain-America:The First Avenger, as well why he never contacted Captain Marvel with his Pager during the Citari invasion of New York, or Ulran's attack Sokovia, in all this is a dissapointment and i hope her character is inproved in Avengers Endgame.",controversial
"Ever since the beeper end scene of Infinity War I was hyped for Captain marvel. I thought to myself this is going to be the Wonder Woman of the MCU. I forgave the dull generic looking trailers because I kept on reading that Captain Marvel will be the face of the new generation of MCU movie and surely Marvel will put in all the stops to make this a memorable and exciting super hero movie.nĂŻÂż 1/2First the good stuff. It was great to know Nick FuryĂŻÂż 1/2(TM)s origin story, I am a huge fan of the character and that in itself is one of the highlights of the film. The alien cat was adorable and pretty memorable too. I actually wanted to see more of it haha.ĂŻÂż 1/2nUnfortunately overall I was extremely let down. With the one exception of Jude LawĂŻÂż 1/2(TM)s bad ass action scene where he was trying to break his chains by punching people with it most of the action scenes felt like generic stuff you usually see in video game trailers. Although she looked perfect for the part I felt that Brie Larson was miscast as Captain Marvel which was a surprise for me because she seem so unrelatable. Maybe it was the script but she did not show sufficient emotion to convince me she was into the character. Even my little nieces who I brought with me thought she was boring.  Which was a pity because when I brought them to Wonder Woman they were standing, hopping, and all excited at the action parts in that movie. Same reaction when I took them to Alita Battle Angel.nnAnother gripe I have on Captain Marvel was none of the events shown in the movie felt significant enough to be tied to Infinity War. Maybe IĂŻÂż 1/2(TM)m wrong but this movie felt more like filler then an integral part of the Infinity War Saga.ĂŻÂż 1/2nAll in all, I guess if youĂŻÂż 1/2(TM)re a huge fan of Marvel this is a must see but it was overhyped. If you take out the Marvel name this one felt like a generic action movie with a few memorable things.",negative
"Brando plays the ace jet pilot, just back from shooting MiGs down in the Korean War. On leave, he discovers his Madame Butterfly, falls in love. The lovers both see the folly of racism and the cruelty which conservative cultural norms can bring to human relations.<br /><br />This film is an excellent romance with a nice twist which rejects the racist, conservative standards, dominant at the time it was made in 1957.

Not c mix of comedy and action, the reason it does not get 5 stars is due to the unlikeability of the main charcater, the only reason this movie did not become a train wreck was due to Samuel L Jackson's phenomenal performance.

"John Cassavette's decided as his first film, obviously as one shot on a shoestring in New York, to not even have a script with dialog, and delivers a 1959 feature equivalent of Larry David's Curb Your Enthusiasm- all the actors know what to do and say and even have the right look in their eyes when they talk. In other words, it's one of the most realistic looks at the beat generation, jazzed sweetly in it's score and telling a tale of racial tensions. A group of black siblings are the center-point, with one trying to get better gigs than the average strip-club, and has a sister, much more light-skinned than him, who gets entwined with a white man in a relationship, which shatters both sides. The film, however, isn't exclusively about that; Cassavettes likes to have his characters wander around New York City (which not many films did in 1959/1960) and his style of storytelling is like that of the improvisational jazz artists of the day. Dated, to be sure, but worth a glance for film buffs; Martin Scorsese named this as one of his heaviest influences.",positive
"hg is normally exploitive, and it's never really bothered me before--i loved ""bloodfeast 2"", but i really don't like pseudo sciences or playing on heuristics. the whole movie is based on a man with esp caused by an electrical accident and a witch. i'm not opposed to witches, and i liked ""carrie"" (the novel and the movie) but this one bothered me. i think it's because of the main character developing esp from an electric line. also the university professor wasting his time studying esp cases. i wasn't alive in the 60s to know first hand whether or not esp was a common fallacy then, but i assume that any theory of such nature would simply be discredited. what really bothered me was the way the police were describing schizophrenics as ruthless, unpredictable villains who can seem like normal people 99% of the time and then just snap. nothing could be further from the truth. i detest such concepts because they add to public idiocy. many people still think that schizophrenia is dissociative identity disorder. whoever wrote this script didn't know much about psychology.<br /><br />there were some decent concepts to the movie. i liked the way the witch used men; it was a nice change. i liked how she could make herself attractive, but didn't when she was around her forced lovers. i found it interesting how her second lover also burned his face. had the script been touched up for a few weeks before production and not focused solely on making its audience dumber, this may have been a decent movie.",negative

This is a pretty run of the mill family move that I am sure most children will enjoy but with really no that much to please any adults viewing the movie. The premise of the film is that Belushi's cop character takes his retirement but gets drawn into a case which results in him becoming a private investigator. The movie's plot is so obvious most of the kids will surely pick the ending before it happens. But additionally to that there seem to be story arcs and sub plots that are forgotten about as the movie progresses. This coupled with a sub plot where the titular K-9 gets pimped out by Belushi. One to be avoided I am afraid.,negative
"Superbly trashy and wondrously unpretentious 80's exploitation, hooray! The pre-credits opening sequences somewhat give the false impression that we're dealing with a serious and harrowing drama, but you need not fear because barely ten minutes later we're up until our necks in nonsensical chainsaw battles, rough fist-fights, lurid dialogs and gratuitous nudity! Bo and Ingrid are two orphaned siblings with an unusually close and even slightly perverted relationship. Can you imagine playfully ripping off the towel that covers your sister's naked body and then stare at her unshaven genitals for several whole minutes? Well, Bo does that to his sister and, judging by her dubbed laughter, she doesn't mind at all. Sick, dude! Anyway, as kids they fled from Russia with their parents, but nasty soldiers brutally slaughtered mommy and daddy. A friendly smuggler took custody over them, however, and even raised and trained Bo and Ingrid into expert smugglers. When the actual plot lifts off, 20 years later, they're facing their ultimate quest as the mythical and incredibly valuable White Fire diamond is coincidentally found in a mine. Very few things in life ever made as little sense as the plot and narrative structure of ""White Fire"", but it sure is a lot of fun to watch. Most of the time you have no clue who's beating up who or for what cause (and I bet the actors understood even less) but whatever! The violence is magnificently grotesque and every single plot twist is pleasingly retarded. The script goes totally bonkers beyond repair when suddenly  and I won't reveal for what reason  Bo needs a replacement for Ingrid and Fred Williamson enters the scene with a big cigar in his mouth and his sleazy black fingers all over the local prostitutes. Bo's principal opponent is an Italian chick with big breasts but a hideous accent, the preposterous but catchy theme song plays at least a dozen times throughout the film, there's the obligatory ""we're-falling-in-love"" montage and loads of other attractions! My God, what a brilliant experience. The original French title translates itself as ""Life to Survive"", which is uniquely appropriate because it makes just as much sense as the rest of the movie: None!",positive

"""Changi"" is an Australian comedy/drama set in the World War 2 Japanese prisoner of war camp of that name. The story cuts between past events, and the present day, when the aged veterans plan a reunion. This is a much publicised and controversial miniseries, here in Australia. The budget ran over ($6.5 million Aust. dollars); historians and veterans criticised it's authenticity; and critics pilloried the uneasy mix of comedy and drama (shades of ""Pearl Harbor""). Series writer John Doyle (half of the successful Roy & H.G. comedy team), has tried to defend himself with comments about ""the characters are composites of actual people""; ""the troops used comedy to cope with the situation""; ""it's only based on actual events""; ""one of our actors was actually there"" etc. I don't have a problem with any of these points. Many superb fictional and factual dramas have come out of the Japanese P.O.W. camp experience: ""King Rat"", ""Tenko"", ""Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence"", ""Bridge on the River Kwai"", ""Paradise Road"", ""Empire of the Sun"", ""Blood Oath"", and ""A Town Like Alice"". Black comedy has often been used successfully in P.O.W dramas: ""Life is Beautiful"", ""The Great Escape"", ""Seven Beauties"", ""Stalag 17"", ""The Colditz Story"", and even ""Hogan's Heroes"". So why is ""Changi"" a monumental failure? - the acting in ""Changi"" is uniformly excellent, the music and cinematography is good - it is the writing and direction that have let it down. Every scene seemed to give me waves of deja vu. When Anthony Hayes is made to stand in the blazing sun, I thought ""Didn't I see Alec Guinness do this in ""Bridge on the River Kwai""?"". The sudden flashes into surreal song & dance brought back Dennis Potter's ""Singing Detective"", but without the finesse. This borrowing happened so often, it smacked of lazy writing by cut and paste, rather than homage. The constant intercutting between the past and present stories left me unable to concentrate on either. Flash forward and flash back can be a useful tool - here it left me distanced from characters, where intensity was called for. The ""Ausiness"" is overdone - every conversation seemed to include ""stone the bloody crows"" & such, that I was saying ""I get the point, I know they're Aussies"". Cultural stereotyping extended to the British and Japanese too -sadistic young Japanese officer; uptight British officer; wiser Japanese commandant; fun-loving, rascally Aussies etc. I thought I was watching ""Hogan's Heroes on the River Kwai"". After 3 episodes I'm tuning out.",negative
"I saw this film when I was 10 or 11 years old, alone in my parent's basement on a Saturday night.

I am 51 now, and only last year was I fortunate enough to locate a relatively recent, quality DVD edition of this wonderfully shudder-inducing supernatural classic, having thought I'd never manage to see it again. I have already watched it four more times, and cannot seem to get tired of it.<br /><br />They just don't make spook films like this one anymore. Haunted catacombs and mist-enshrouded graveyards just don't work as well in color as they did in black and white back in the day.

"For every woman and girl who has been told to smile more, or to slow down, or that she's too emotional, or that she can't have kids while also having other dreams - the representation in the Captain Marvel movie matters.nnThis movie brings us an image of breaking free from repressive patriarchy and gaslighting through empowerment, strong female friendship, autonomy, and even at one point the coopting of a symbol of hypermasculinity. It also brings us pretty solid POC inclusion, reminds us that history is sculpted by the people who tell its story, brings light to the struggles of refugees, and highlights the error in speciesism.nnOf course, I'd love just about any movie with a cat and 90s throwback music.

"Captain Marvel is a deeply mundane and hallow movie. While it retains the great visual effects that is to be expected from a marvel movie, the plot is needlessly convoluted and has more holes than a cheese grater, the characters are either cardboard cut-outs of what they're supposed to represent or deflated versions of already known characters. The overall themes, though served with good intentions, are presented in a bland, un-empowering way. Wonder Woman is a super heroine movie that actually empowers and humanizes women in a way that is serviceable to the real world. Brie Larson gives us a bland performance, which is unusual given her track record. This movie is a stain on the later stage of the MCU, much like the films of the first stage.

I was waiting to see more emotion from Brie Larson's character but the performance was a bit wooden.  The same goes for Samuel Jackson, he is usually a very charismatic actor but this time his performance was only so-so.

"First off, this movie was a wild ride the whole way. The story of the training of the soldiers, fighting with their superiors, and in the end grouping together.<br /><br />From the very beginning to the very end. This is one War Drama worth seeing if you are in for the constant cussing (at times beyond reason) and the horrors of what boot camp are.<br /><br />The dynamics of how the actors interacted was quite amazing at times, and sometimes humorous. How Bozz (Colin Farrel) deals with Paxton (Matthew Davis) throughout the storyline, from camp to Tigerland, and even in the end helping him.<br /><br />The innovative free-hand filming did add a certain taste or flavor to the film. Constant moving, constant action, and just constant confusion. At times, it was a help. Others, not so much.<br /><br />Throughout the film, it was increasingly realistic. Some points in the film (the sex scenes in particular) seemed to be just a tad too realistic even though they added an effect to the movie that wouldn't have been there without them. it was a very gritty movie, through and through.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is one of Colin Farrel's better movies (if not his top performance).

"Recap: A band of five young American men, all that is left of a platoon hit hard during the Ardenne offensive during the WWII get the assignment as a forward outpost and to look for enemy activity. They're in really bad condition, both physically and mentally, and think they have struck gold when their outpost is in an abandoned but once plush mansion full with food. But after a while there is some enemy activity, and it is very odd. Not hostile, but odd. It seems like there is a German squad out there, in equally bad condition, that want nothing more than to surrender.<br /><br />Comments: Based on a novel and my guess that the novel is much better but the story doesn't seem to translate very well to the big screen. Indeed it is a different war movie, much more about the mental pressure during wartimes than fighting and battles. But I can almost feel that scenes that must have been full of suspense, full of uncertainties and unknown elements, just fall flat in the movie. It is not suspenseful, just different and in many ways absurd. Many times people just act insane, and the reasons are unclear or at best hinted at.<br /><br />So when this mental pressure fails to come through, the main building piece of the entire story, I thought the story fell through. It wasn't good, it wasn't interesting, it didn't keep me on the edge and it didn't really send a message. Actually it did nothing.<br /><br />The cast is interesting, many young actors that then turned into stars in beginning of their careers. The acting is good, but not stellar, and a few characters also fell through into the absurd zone.

There is no life in the role, and I believe it is due to Larson's inability to convey who her character is. Perhaps this is not just due to her flaws but those of the writing and directing teams. nShe is a great actress, but I feel she did not have or was not given enough to work with. The character She portrays has little to no character growth and her hero's journey is almost nonexistent. The side characters were far more interesting to watch.

Pure abstraction isn't really my thing, but I can take it in small doses and the super-saturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feel of this series of flowers, Rohrschach blots, birds, etc is pretty compelling and quite beautiful.

"Im amazed how people judged Brie's acting just froma trailer. This goes to show that humans are too judgemental.nnI watched the film twice and to begin with, I was a neutral viewer, aint a fan of brie larson at all. And naturally, I became a fan of hers after the film.nnTo be fair, it isnt easy to be a woman-led hero on the big screen but Brie pulled it off. She brought out the character exceptionally well and she made the effort to interact with actual airforce pilots and reading up comics on Captain Marvel to immerse herself into the character. She took up this film to promote awareness on gender equality and show to young girls that they too, can lead on a big screen. nnYes, a film is a film and its meant to be for entertainment. But, given this global platform, isnt it more meaningful to make an impact for a better and fairer world in this already existing sexist, misogynistic culture?

I thought it was a good movie, deserving at least  at least 85%. The movie had good action scenes and good comedy scenes, the lead actress did seem a bit stiff and the character a bit one dimensional, but overall a decent performance. I was unaware of the  politcal drama surounding the film but it helps explain the disparity between the film's quality and the reviews.I guess that's the way of social politics; the only right opinion is the one that agrees with my own.

"This movie was soiled by two things; its PR being muddied by a social-political diatribe that alienates half of Marvel's already established audience, and Hollywood's lack of ambition when writing female protagonists.nnCaptain Marvel's biggest problem was a not having any notable flaws (something quite common with how female protagonists are being written today). This makes both the story and the character bland and uninteresting.nnBrie Larson was clearly directed poorly and given very little to work with from a character point-of-view. With a face that didn't move for 90% of the movie and a grandiose self-entitled attitude all the while giving the finger to giant number of Marvel's fan base - Brie Larson (and thus Captain Marvel) came off as largely unlikeable, making it hard to route for her in the movie, and if her attitude doesn't change and her character becomes more devoid of any discernible emotions she'll be hard to route for during the rest of her future in the MCU (a massive shame as she has proved herself to be a great and likeable actress in the past - see Room and Free Fire).nnThe overall pros are great cinematography and special effects. Plus Sammy J just about stops it from being the worst movie in the MCU to date... maybe. I'm not sure if I prefer this to Ant-Man & The Wasp yet.",negative
"One of the finest pieces of television drama of the last decade. Throughout the five hours, ones perceptions and sympathies are constantly challenged as it explores many facets of modern day British society. David Morrisey is, as usual, brilliant. At first coming across as a heavy handed copper in conflict with the heroine, but then proving to be intelligent and caring, as he works with her in uncovering the truth. I have never seen Surrane Jones before. I believe she comes from the world of television soaps. Her performance was magnificent, as she maintains her humour and composure whilst trying to balance the demands of the case and the stress of caring for her mother. I could go on and talk about every member of the cast who contributes to this magnificent drama, but their efforts would mean little without such an absorbing script that constantly challenges your assumptions about any of the characters. It is programmes like this that restore one's faith in television drama, whilst at the same time making it almost impossible to settle for most of the garbage that is increasingly filling the airwaves.",positive
"The good: Starts off with an AWESOME Stan Lee tribute!! Sam Jackson and ""Goose"" the cat are fantastic together.  Notable performances by Ben Mendelson and I really enjoyed Clark Gregg's participation. Lashana Lynch's performance as Maria Rambeau gave the movie some heart.nnThe bad: Brie Larson's acting was not what you'd expect from an Oscar-winner.  Her performance was very bland; her reactions to everything was the same, there was no real character growth, and she easily overcame every obstacle of the movie, no real Hero's journey.  The one line where she corrects Sam Jackson saying her race was ""noble warrior HEROES"" was very cringe.  A few pointed feminist comments were very unnecessary.nnSome of the CGI was very awful, particularly a few CGI scenes of Goose in awkward situations.nnThis movie isn't relevant to the MCU, you don't need to see it.nnFinal thoughts:  I did my best to watch the movie separate from its horrible marketing, and I have to admit that the movie wasn't nearly as bad as I expected.  The marketing plus Larson's performance are the biggest reasons I can't really give the movie more than 2 stars.  Hopefully my review will post, I feel like I have been struggling very hard with whatever review filter keeps blocking my posts.",controversial
"First of all, the release date is 2009, not 2007 for this feature length nature documentary film. It should be more properly referred to as: ""Earth, 2009"". Secondly, allow me to address the complaints of some reviewers who have seen the ""Planet Earth"" TV series of 2006. <br /><br />I have not seen this TV series, but learned here, that this film is the full length version of this 2006 TV series. I judge any film, on it's own merits, not by it's source. I judge the results, on their own, and the results of ""Earth, 2009"" are indeed excellent. I dismiss this trivial complaint of some reviewers: that it's simply an expanded version of the 2006 TV series ""Planet Earth"". So what? It doesn't really matter.<br /><br />As a film buff and one who has viewed dozens of nature documentaries in my lifetime, I was astonished and highly impressed by ""Earth, 2009"". This is the debut film from the new ""DisneyNature"" division of Disney and follows in the footsteps of Walt Disney's pioneering and Academy Award winning nature documentary films of the 1950's and 1960's.<br /><br />Cinematography, film editing, music score, sound and narration are all excellent. There have been a few other nature documentaries that also excelled in these categories. What really sets ""Earth, 2009"" apart is its' scope. It literally covers the entire planet, covering all seven continents.<br /><br />After my first viewing, it was obvious this documentary film required a massive effort and amount of time and talent to create. <br /><br />Three production companies were required to make this amazing documentary film.<br /><br />""Earth, 2009"" convincingly tells the stories of four species on their great migrations as it spans one year through the seasons beginning in January and ending in December, from the North Pole to the South Pole.<br /><br />Two special new high-tech cameras were used for this film: one camera has a 360 degree computer controlled motorized rotating lens and the other is a HD camera set to an amazing 1,000 frames per second. This filming technique really added drama and beauty to some of the scenes of ""Earth, 2009"" especially the cheetah chase and great white sharks leaping out of the water to catch sea lions and an aerial view going over the edge of the world's highest waterfall. There are many stunningly beautiful shots in this documentary.<br /><br />Via cinematography, music score and narration, there is drama, sadness, humor and great beauty in this documentary. With a great music score performed by the world renowned Berliner Philharmoniker, excellent creative and technical cinematography and James Earl Jones narration, I consider ""Earth, 2009"" as the greatest nature feature length documentary film ever made.<br /><br />Five years of hard work, patience, talent and dedication really paid off very well here. This film should be required viewing in all schools throughout the world. I predict an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, among other awards. Truly, an amazing, astonishing, exhilarating and magnificent documentary film.<br /><br />Very Highly Recommended",positive

In the midst of all the sickness, its difficult to lead a normal life which the protagonist, Konkana Sen, does. Serious movie, not to be watched with children or expecting wives. Page-3 of newspapers is the usual place for reporting the activities going on in the parties of the rich and elite who indulge in much more filth then what is reported. How this Page-3 is also a business prospect is shown in the movie. Event management firms get paid to arrange parties and make a rich but not famous people famous overnight by clicking photographs with the celebrities invited to the party.<br /><br />The western culture has crept into the high society of Mumabi quite deeply.

"This Columbo episode is probably noted more for the director, Steven Spielberg, as one of his early films. It should be looked at for Jack Cassidy's role as the murderer who kills his partner in writing to maintain his lifestyle. Jack Cassidy would appear in a later Columbo. After all, Columbo meets his match in Jack Cassidy's character. He is a mystery writer who plots to perform the perfect murder. After his first murder, his next victim would be the annoying general store owner/widow who would blackmail him for money. Rather than losing more money, he kills her. It is very entertaining to watch Cassidy and Falk as always. Falk's familiarity as Columbo makes him watchable after viewing this episode repeatedly over the years. What television today forgets about the success of years is that people will want to watch the shows again and again if they like the characters. It's not about who does it, how and why, it the familiarness of Columbo and his likability which scores high with viewers like myself.",positive

However, in some reviews, that i have read, critics have complained that Hiralal's relationship with his brothers was not highlighted, and his siblings were completely erased from the story. Now i would really like to raise a point here that as the name of the movie suggests, it is not a movie about Hiralal's brothers, it is a movie on the relationship of Mahatma Gandhi and his son Hiralal Gandhi, nothing more nothing less. If we start complaining about some characters being kept out of action in the movie, it would be a bit unfair because these characters don't fit in the picture, no matter how relevant they were in real life.

"<br /><br />Summary: Not worth the film<br /><br />As an avid Gone With the Wind fan, I was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters. Luckily, the film on its own was a wonderful piece. When the book Scarlett came out, I read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together. While the book lacks any true quality, it remains a good story, and, as long as I was able to separate it from the original, was and still is enjoyable. However, I consider the six hours I spent watching the ""Scarlett"" miniseries to be some of the worst-spent hours of my life. Discrediting any of the original character traits so well-formed in Margaret Mitchell's book, this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape, mistrust, murder, and misformed relationships that even the book Scarlett stayed away from. The casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well-formed in both the original novel and film, and even carried through in the second book, and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character. In the novel, Scarlett O'Hara Butler follows her estranged husband Rhett Butler to Charleston under the guise of visiting extended family. After coming to an ""arrangement"" with Rhett, she agrees to leave, and proceeds to reconnect with her O'Hara relatives in Savannah. Eventually, she accompanies her cousin Colum, a passionate leader of the Fenian Brotherhood, to Ireland, to further explore her family's ""roots that go deep,"" and is eventually named ""The O'Hara,"" the head of the family. While her duties as The O'Hara keep her engaged in her town of Ballyhara, Scarlett ventures out into the world of the English landowners, and instantly becomes a sought-after guest at many of their parties. She, having been scorned by Rhett time and time again, eventually agrees to marry Luke, the earl of Fenton, until Rhett comes along in a clichéd ""night-on-white-horse"" - type of a rescue. The ""Scarlett"" miniseries fails even to do this justice. Raped by her fiancé and scorned by her family, the series shows Scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed.<br /><br />I heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision.<br /><br />",negative
"Like many others have commented before me here, I have to say that this movie is bad, but not the worst I've seen. There will be no direct references to movie plots or sequences in this comment, because I hate spoilers.<br /><br />I got a feeling I was watching an episode of a TV show or something, where they had gotten a hold of some extra $$$ to spend on CGI (I've seen worse of those)... All in all, it is quite an insult to the viewer, at least if you have ANY knowledge about computers and/or technology at all. There are just too many of these moments of insults to make me feel comfortable, and I found myself just begging for it all to end - fast - halfway through. In addition, there are countless ""easy way out"" scenarios, which also is an insult to your intelligence as a thinking human being...<br /><br />This movie absolutely fades in comparison to the old ""Wargames"", and I think it's a damn shame they even got to call it a sequel.<br /><br />Two stars from me, because of one thing and one thing only: the actors' performances aren't half-bad, considering the regurgitated crap of a script they had to work with. Still, they should never have signed on to this movie. Not really a career-move, but I guess we all have bills to pay.<br /><br />To those of you who gave this movie top score...you have to be on the studio's payroll or something, that's my only explanation.<br /><br />To all who haven't seen this one: by all means, watch it and make up your own mind.

"This is a perfectly watchable adventurous movie to watch, with a great cast and a good story, based on true events.<br /><br />It's interesting to note that the story of the movie is based on true events. It's above all for most part an adventurous story, with all of the usual ingredients you would expect from an adventurous movies set in an Arabic world. So, lots of sword fighting, good old fashioned honor, religion and a rich proud country. But the movie is also filled with humor, to make the movie a light and pleasant one to watch.<br /><br />The constant cutting back and forth between the Morocco plot involving Sean Connery and Candice Berger and the American plot line involving Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) wasn't the best possible approach in my opinion. The two things have totally different paces, totally different characters, it are just totally different worlds! Of course both story lines are connected and focuses on the same thing but the contrast between the two worlds is just too big to let it work out. It doesn't at all times make the movie feel connected and a bit disjointed. The American plot line is most of the time more political while the Morrocan plot line is purely adventurous and action filled. In the end you could perhaps even wonder what the whole point or Roosevelt in this movie was. Seem that John Milius is just a big admirer of him. Often the American plot line would take away most of the pace out of the far more interesting and more action filled fast paced Morrocan plot line. After all, John Milius always has been at his best as an action director.<br /><br />It isn't until halve way through that the movie fully gets on steam. The most- and largest scaled action of the movie then kicks in. Especially the large scale end battle does not disappoint. I wish the entire movie was like this. That way this movie would had also been a better known one, no doubt.<br /><br />The movie has a great Jerry Goldsmith musical score, that is perhaps way better known than the actual movie itself. The movie is also a good looking one with great production design and nice looking action and battle sequences in it. Appereantly the movie only costs $4,000,000 to make but that is really hard to believe, considering the settings and size of the movie. I mean John Milius his best known movie ""Conan the Barbarian"" cost about $20,000,000 to make but was a far more campy looking one and was less impressive on its scale.<br /><br />Quite funny to see an Arabic speak with a big fat Scottish accent but hey, it's Sean Connery so you just simply tend to accept this. He suits his role well. So does Candice Bergen. It's always hard for a female character to come across as believable and work out in a movie such as this one but she manages. Also John Huston plays a great role in this movie!<br /><br />A perfectly fine watchable movie!<br /><br />7/10",positive

In a nutshell, poor script and poor acting from Larson. Her performance just couldn't hold my attention throughout the movie. She just felt emotionless. At first when I'd seen the trailers, I thought her stone-cold facial expressions must have been how her character was written, but it wasn't. Her character was just simply that boring. Captain Marvel has no charisma at all. I got a feeling of invulnerability from her. She felt needlessly overpowered and she was overly confident to the point where it just didn't fit at all. How could the writers not realise by now that it's not power or ability that makes a good super-hero. The CGI and the action sequences were redeeming factors but overall as a movie, it was horrendous. This movie makes Thor Dark World look good.nnTo sum up, go see for yourself and make your own opinions. But don't bother reading the critics ""professional"" reviews I've seen littered throughout this site. I've read them and the majority of them are biased and obviously paid off to sell the film in a positive light to the public. Don't be fooled by their agendas. Read real audience reviews.

"This movie illustrates like no other the state of the Australian film industry and everything that's holding it back.<br /><br />Awesome talent, outstanding performances (particularly by Victoria Hill), but a let down in practically every other way.<br /><br />An ""adaptation"" of sorts, it brought nothing new to Macbeth (no, setting it in present-day Australia is not enough), and essentially, completely failed to justify its existence, apart from (let's face it, completely unnecessarily) paying homage to the original work. If there's one body of work that has been done (and done and done and done), it's Shakespeare's. So any adaptation, if it's not to be a self-indulgent and pointless exercise, needs to at least bring some new interpretation to the work.<br /><br />And that's what this Macbeth fails to do. As it was done, this film has no contemporary relevance whatsoever. It's the same piece that we have seen countless (too many!) times before. Except with guns and in different outfits.<br /><br />Apart from the fundamental blunder (no other way to put it) of keeping the original Shakespearian dialogue, one of the more cringeful moments of the movie is the prolonged and incredibly boring slow motion shoot out towards the end, during which I completely tuned out, even though I was looking at the screen. I never thought I had a short attention span, but there you go.<br /><br />I suppose the movie succeeds on its own, very limited terms. But as Australia continues to produce world-class acting talent, its movie-makers need to stop being proud of succeeding on limited terms, and actually set high enough standards to show that they respect for the kind of acting talent they work with.<br /><br />A shame.

It is well acted out, so real and never a dull moment. The acting is superb and the location makes the movie seem like you are there. From the beginning right up to the end, this movie is the type that makes you lose your attention. The actress does an excellent job of portraying the girl who survived this horrific plane crash in the Amazon and it shows how she managed to survive in the Amazon all alone. It is unbelievable that anyone could survive under such conditions. This is why this movie is so appealing. The fact that this is a true story makes the movie even more interesting and to think that a young girl could survive from this ordeal is overwhelming. I find this movie one that I can watch over and over again and one that I never get tired of. This is indeed quite a compliment as I have hundreds of movies!

"OK so this movie is not terrible. As a movie on TV I would watch it. But.. This was supposed to build hype for End game, it was supposed to be vital to build a character who would be vital to that film. It fails.. miserably. Captain marvel is bland, indestructible, not phased by anything (even the 90's) I blame the directors, Marvel has been very skilled in recruiting new directors and unleashing their talent. This pair.. which turned into 5 writers, failed. It looks and plays like a film where 5 people got a go in turns at the script, they also shamelessly rip off scenes from multiple other movies, Terminator 2. (boots motorcycle) Top Gun (higher further faster) buddy cop movies, and various phase one movies (the worst ones). The key issues is that this film ignores every rule of building a story arc. There is no 'arc' for this character. She starts out supper tough, and ends up super tough with some fancy extra flashy lighting. The irony is the writers KNOW that carol has to fall and rise up again to build this empathy for the character. The one scene that is kinda great is where she is battling for her right to use her power in a 'in the mind' sequence. In it she is shown falling down and getting up again and again to finally stand tall and take her power. They clearly know that this is needed. But did she ever fall in the movie? Not once is she anything but indestructible, not once does she get crushed and need to fight her way out of a situation of genuine threat and win the day. She doesn't win.. she coasts the entire movie. She is so overpowered if not nerfed she will ruin End Game. The music is good. The worlds we see are gorgeous. Sam Jackson works his ass off to bring some light to the film, and Ben Mendalson is brilliant, and shows a full array of emotion and character depth. Carol.. She has like three expressions, and is so one dimensional. This is the worst MCU movie. It reminds me of a middling early era xmen movie, but with less interesting characters.",negative

"Captain Marvel: The ReviewnnI don't even know where to begin when it comes to rating this movie on a scale of good or bad. The best word I can use to describe it is ""awkward.""nnLots of really questionable editing choices throughout this film. You never truly get a feel for the scope of the story or the world it takes place in. The flashback scenes in particular are not used effectively and their inclusion into the movie feels disjointed. Many of the editing cuts don't feel organic, giving the entire movie a sense that something feels ""off.""nnThe musical score is so inconspicuous, you likely wont even know there is one. There is no Captain Marvel ""Theme""(atleast not any nthat you will notice); no themes at all, just background prattle that goes unnoticed.nnRegarding the supposed ""Feminist"" agenda in this movie, it is largely a non-issue for the most part. The media hyping the ""identity"" aspects of the film should be ashamed of themselves for claiming this is some sort of inspiration narrative. The push to make this a ""watershed"" moment in our culture are a complete manufacturing of the media promoting it as such. The trailer promoting Captain Marvel as a HERo is more puissant than anything in the actual movie. nnThere is a sliver of this ""girls can do it to!"" theme sprinkled throughout the story, but they are so unexplored and unimpactful that it leaves little impression at all. If anything, the story ncould have benefited from some strong theme or ideal to drive the nmotivation of the main character; as it is now, any motivation at all feels muted.nnCaptain Marvel as a character is dull, uninteresting and not very compelling. There is no charisma at all.  Brie Larson was clearly miscast in this role, or at very least misdirected. The script does not work in her favor and there is no synergy between them. nSometimes it feels like everyone on screen is more intriguing than nthe main character.nnWe are repeatedly told in this movie that Captain Marvel needs to ""control her emotions,"" but we never see this displayed anywhere in the story. There is no payoff to this character theme. We never see this ""character flaw"" and we never see it overcome. Character nand personality seem to be something this script lacks. nnThis movie makes several attempts at capturing that Marvel style humor, and it falls flat at every turn. From scripting to delivery it fails at humor.nnThe much hailed 90's nostalgia is largely superficial and you really start to question why it wasn't set in the present day. Setting it in the past leaves more questions and leaps in logic than it provides in merit.nnThis does not feel like the 1990's at all. You will see many ""things"" from the 90's shoved into many scenes, but nothing feels authentic. All the dialogue feels very modern and typical of any movie you would see today; nothing distinctive about the 90's is on ndisplay here in any meaningful way.nnWhile the main plot is ""typical"" of Marvel; the story is not told in an engaging way, and little about the entire scope of the character's world is explored. The ongoing war between the Kree and Skrull is at the center of the plot, but nothing about it is nreally explained. We learn nothing about why they are fighting or what their motivations are in the larger war. The whole conflict boils down to ""we need to find the macguffin!""nnThe movie also betrays the very concept of the war from the source nmaterial. By portraying one side as sympathetic and oppressed and nthe other as power hungry and manipulative; they have completely nstripped the conflict of it's more interesting complexities. The whole point was supposed to be that neither side is truly more right or wrong than the other; that is what makes it interesting.nnWhile it is a ""Comic book movie"" and we can expect a little ""suspension of disbelief,"" it would be nice if we could atleast get an explanation for how things work in this world. nnHow do Captain Marvel's powers work? What are their limits? nnWhere do her powers come from? A ""lightspeed"" engine explodes and the energy is somehow absorbed? How does an engine give her Kree blood? Did the Kree inject her with it in a deleted scene? Did the engine give her Kree blood because the Kree built it? nnAs far as the rest of the cast, everyone else is mostly fine. Samuel L Jackson is who you expect him to be. Both Jude Law and Ben Mendelsohn perform acceptably with what they are given. nnThe worst thing about the movie is that it really is uneventful, and forgettable. There is little here that will likely be needed to enjoy the upcoming Avengers Endgame. I would actually wager; Captain Marvel's introduction in that movie will probably be far more entertaining without the needless and trivial backstory presented here.nnOverall, it's a shallow, uninspired, and mediocre Hollywood product of our time. Meh, I'd give a 2 out of 5, I guess.nnP.S. If Captain Marvel is the face of the MCU going forward; the future has a very boring face.",controversial

"A CRY IN THE DARK <br /><br />A CRY IN THE DARK was a film that I anticipated would offer a phenomenal performance from Meryl Streep and a solid, if unremarkable film. This assumption came from the fact that aside from Streep's Best Actress nomination, the movie received little attention from major awards groups.<br /><br />Little did I anticipate that A CRY IN THE DARK would be such a riveting drama, well-constructed on every level. If you ask me, this is an under-appreciatted classic.<br /><br />The film opens rather slowly, letting the audience settle into the Chamberlain's at a relaxed pace and really notice that, at the core, they are an incredibly loving, simple family. Fred Schepisi (the director) selects random moments to capture of a family on vacation that give a looming sense of the oncoming tragedy, while also showing the attentive bliss with which Lindy (Streep) and Michael (Sam Neill) Chamberlain care for their children.<br /><br />While the famous line ""A Dingo Took My Baby!"" has become somewhat of a punchline these days, the movie never even comes close to laughable. The actual death of Azaria is horrifyingly captured. It is subtle and realistic, leaving the audience horrified and asking questions.<br /><br />The majority of the film takes place in courtrooms and focuses on the Chamberlain's continuous fight to prove their innocence to the press and the court, which suspects Lindy of murder.<br /><br />The fact that it is clear to us from the beginning that they are innocent makes the tense trials all the more gripping. As an audience member, I was fully invested in the Chamberlain's plight... and was genuinely angered and hurt and saddened when they were made to look so terrible by the media. But at the same, the media/public opinion is understandable. I loved the way the media was by no means made to be sympathetic, but they always had valid reasons to hold their views.<br /><br />The final line of the film is very profound and captures perfectly the central element that makes this film so much different from other courtroom dramas.<br /><br />In terms of performances, the only ones that really matter in this film are those of Streep and Neill... and they deliver in every way. For me, this ranks as one of (if not #1) Meryl Streep's best performances. For all her mastery of different accents (which of course are very impressive in their own right), Streep never loses the central heart and soul of her characters. I find this to be one of Streep's more subtle performances, and she hits it out of the park. And Neill, an actor who has never impressed me beyond being charismatic and appealing in JURASSIC PARK, is a perfect counterpoint to Streep's performance. From what I've seen, this is undoubtedly Neill's finest work to date. It's a shame he wasn't recognized by the Academy with a Leading Actor nomination to match Streep's... b/c the two of them play of each other brilliantly.<br /><br />More emotionally gripping than most films, and also incredibly suspenseful... A CRY IN THE DARK far exceeded my expectations.

"Yes, this gets the full ten stars. It's plain as day that this fill is genius. The universe sent Trent Harris a young, wonderfully strange man one day and Harris caught him on tape, in all that true misfit glory that you just can't fake. Too bad it ended in tragedy for the young man, if only an alternate ending could be written for that fellow's story. The other two steps in the trilogy do retell the story, with Sean Penn and Crispin Glover in the roles of the young men, respectively. The world is expanded upon and the strangeness is contextualized by the retelling, giving us a broader glimpse into growing up weird in vanilla America. Recommended for anyone and everyone!",positive
"Didn't the writer for this movie see the other three? I loved the original, I thought 2 was the best, I tolerated 3 (it was OK, nothing special). But I HATED this one. Who dare they kill off UG? This was certainly not the Ug who had been almost like a brother to Charlie in number 2. Remember his speech? Charlie said, ""You wouldn't just leave me on Earth, would you"". Ug replied, ""Charlie, Bounty Hunter"", saying that he was now one of them now. How dare the writers ignore this special bond between them and turn him into a baddie who get's killed by Charlie (in a particularly awkward scene) just because they realized the movie was getting boring. In fact for the first 20 minutes, we get a new cast and have to wait this long until we again find out what happened to Charlie, who was the hero we've been waiting to see. I kept waiting saying, ""Come on, when's Charlie going to appear?"" Angela Basset must be doing her best to deny she was ever in this Turkey. Moving it to the future eliminates the possibility of ever seeing a sequel with the original cast or in our time. I think the writers decided, that their movie was going to be the last and they could do whatever they wanted. This movie is totally out of line with the first two. And it didn't even seem like it was written by the same people who made 3. 3 at least had humor and could easily be seen by younger Children. 4 is just ugly and mean-spirited (Eric DaRe) is particularly cruel and unnecessary.

"Any movie where the star of the movie, wasn't the actual star of the movie is gonna be bad. Mendelsohn was simply the best part of this movie, followed by Samuel Jackson. Unfortunately Goose the cat (a literal cat) was more entertaining than Bree Larson. For a studio with a plethora of superhero origin stories under its belt this film falls flat on it's face. The issues this underwhelming movie had began to show itself in the marketing, and I didn't listen to my instincts and wasted money at the theaters to see this film. They chose the wrong person to be captain marvel and the wrong director. Bree's acting range was about as wide as a playing card and left so much wanting. They completely stomped on the history of a long established character in Mar-Vell. And so obviously were trying to push a certain agenda with multiple cringe worthy moments in this film. I really could have waited for this film to be on tv. This is the only comic book based movie that I do not own. That in itself tells you what I think of it. ",controversial

"Ok first of all: Marvel movies have always been about entertainment. It's not meant to be some deep, brilliant piece of cinematic history (except Black Panther, that was an epically well done film).nnCaptain Marvel is FUN. It has all of the things that we've come to love and expect in a Marvel flick: well done and choreographed fight scenes, self-discovery and acceptance, and a whole lot of humor (Goose is a scene-stealer). The soundtrack is straight up 90s nostalgia. This is definitely one of my favorite Marvel movies to date. It also is great in one thing it lacks: a romantic relationship. This isn't a feminist thing; Captain America suffers from it (does anyone else find the Sharon thing weird?). It gives more time for the characters that matter. nnIt's worth your money to go see it in theaters. Twice.",controversial
"Great party movie, following the adventures of Bill & Tom, two high school buddies at opposite ends of the spectrum. Bill (Eric Stolz) prefers to live life straight-laced, while his friend Tom (Chris Penn) takes nothing seriously except partying all the time. When Bill moves out of his mother's house to live on his own he faces many issues, from his girlfriend, to his brother, to his landlord. Meanwhile, his friend Tom moves in to keep the rent down but proceeds to turn Bill's life upside down. This movie is non-stop comedy from start to finish and is a personal favorite of mine. Soundtrack features guitar virtioso Edward Van Halen throughout the movie, also features cameos by rockers Lee Ving and Ron Wood. 70s Pornstar legend Kitten Navidad also makes an appearance! Classic 80s movie is worth multiple looks. Now all that needs to be done is a much anticipated DVD release! If you enjoyed this movie, take a look at ""The Last American Virgin"" which is similar to ""Wild Life"". I rate both highly.",positive
"I enjoyed the movie for what it was. Despite the timing of the movie and the Ă˘dramaĂ˘? it wasn't bad movie. nIf I was to criticize the movie I say the script wasn't the best and there was a few scenes where the acting was wonkey, and the CGI usage was a bit distracting but not as bad as the other entries in the a MCU. The cast was great, however better directing choices would push the cast and story further. The few questions of the MCU lore was answered leading to having more questions asked. Most importantly the movie didn't have me connect with Captain Marvel due to having more questions asked. nI love the usage of 90s nostalgia, the fight scenes, Sam Jackson was great, and RIP Stan Lee. nIf your a casual movie perosn then you'll enjoy it maybe cretique it by the standards nIf your a comic book fan you may be split due to some of the changes compared to the comics and, movie recons.

"Mark Walhberg in a great role, idolises a rock star to the extent of knowing all his songs, imitating him to perfection, and dressing like him. When the opportunity comes for him to take over his ""idol's"" role in the band, he jumps at the opportunity. However the role of a rock star may not be what it is cracked up to be... and relationships can change .... This movie certainly struck me as having the theme of what you attain for may not be what you think it is once you get it. Overall a really good movie with great performances from all the cast as well as the two leads, Mark Walhberg and Jennifer Aniston. It did make me feel sad, especially when Emily, (Jennifer Aniston), met up with Chris in Seattle and saw the depths to what he had sunk. If anybody ever dreamed of being a rock star or a groupie they should watch this movie to see that the lifestyle, although glamourous for a while, is very lonely and ultimately not what you may want.",positive

"It was better in places than I expected and worse in others. Overall, Captain Marvel is a passable superhero movie that my daughter (8) really liked. It was no Wonder Woman, but it was good fun and featured a badass superheroine my daughter could associate herself with, minus the complexities that set Wonder Woman apart. That being said, Bree Larson is the least of the actors in this movie. If not for Lashana Lynch's portrayal of Maria Rambeau, I wouldn't really have given a second thought to caring for Carol Danvers as a character. Lynch's Rambeau showed enough emotion and depth of friendship to compensate for Larson's lack of any real personality. I know that in the comics, Maria's daughter, Monica, takes a turn as Captain Marvel. I am one who would rather see Lynch take a turn in the role! nnThere was a LOT of lazy writing as far as plot goes in this movie. The completely crappy security at top secret  government compounds is just one issue I had. The lack of character building for Danvers was really obvious. The Mary Sue powers of Captain Marvel was mildly annoying, however, the retcon of her power origin was interesting. The fact that she seems to now be a human container for the power of the tesseract was a neat choice of direction. There were so many shut your brain off moments that I couldn't help but to object. Why did the super-experimental test flight have a full load of ammunition onboard? Why did Carol Danvers HAVE to pilot the super secret ship in its test when the scientist that built it insisted on being the pilot? Where did all of the Shield agents go in the files room? How did the Skrull get to earth so quickly, when it took the Kree 22 hours? How did one minor electric stun take out Captain Marvel in the beginning, but minutes later, she shrugs them off like little more than pests? How did no one notice the stray cat running around the inside of a Top Secret Government facility for 6 years? How did Fury find Carol Danvers at a bar after she lost him on the train? So many more nonsensical plot points! Anyway...If you shut your brain off, it's a mildly enjoyable romp that young girls will love and many Marvel fans will like. One last note...the Music they picked from the 90s for the soundtrack...EXTREMELY distracting in parts (see big fights see near the end when they play ""Just a Girl"" by No Doubt...or ""Come as You Are"" by Nirvana during a mildly trippy battle on the mental plane.",negative

"Perfectly average super-hero movie. Samuel L. Jackson (Nick Fury) shines in this movie, playing off the stoic Brie Larson (Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel) perfectly.

It felt like Samuel L Jackson was desperately using a bucket to stop a leaking ship go under, with zero assistance from the rest of the cast. A vacuuous, boring filler movie that, in my opinion, serves no purpose and is a dark cloud hanging over the otherwise brilliant marvel series. As a female I cringe when these forced feminist pandering agendas are the main promotional and talking points for the movie. Especially when the on screen equivalent of those claims translate as badly as they have here. Everything that Brie has said, i support. Everything that the movie is, I dont.

"While not the worst movie I've seen this movie does lack a large bit of charisma and nuance to allow you to think about things on your own. It's a show without substance and has to at points tell you so much you can loose yourself at moments as characters literally talk over themselves. They took Fury and made him a bumbling baby talking cat cuddler instead of the man willing to pull a pistol on a plane if he thought he could take it down. Here he held a cat and a spoilers he losses his eye in the dumbest of ways for it. The music collection feels like a guardians knock off at best with a song playing in the finale that had me rolling my eyes. nnBree Larson may be an insufferable person outside of this movie but she wasn't the worst choice. However the film suffers from writing differences, choppy editing, and a protracted sense of forcing a certain view point down our throats through it all while giving only the barest of character arcs. In the end, it does make an already weak villain from Guardians seem even worse, Question the intervening ten or so years from Captain Marvel and Iron Man that changed Fury so much; and just why this OP, can breath in space character doesn't show up and destroy everything that the Avengers struggled with for ten years. The only reason feels shackled in with ADR and three second scene. It's weak at best and continuity breaking at worst.nnTo my surprise, however, beyond certain parts i could watch this without too much complaint beyond what I said above. I don't believe I could watch it again however, as everything I needed to Ă˘seeĂ˘? was already shown, and the last fight scene ended up giving my friend and myself migraines from it's flashing strobing effects. 2 1/2 stars and the weakest film to date despite it supposed entry to the strongest MCU character.",negative
"OK. I admit. I'm one of those nerds who have spent all to many hours with my beloved DVD player and my wonderful television set watching science fiction series. Star Trek (Next Generation) was my first space date, and since then I've switched partners regularly. I've seen'em all, it seems, and my favorites are «Lexx», «Farscape» and the new «Battlestar Galactica», in other words: the newest, state of the art space operas. But, I also have a general crush on the old fashioned ones, the cheap ones, like the magnificent four seasoned BBC show «Blakes7». Here, the budgets are smaller than hobbits, the special effects seem to be made on a Commodore 64, but who cares when the scripts are sharp and intelligently written with dark humor, the acting dead serious and at times even high class?<br /><br />But why do they always speak English in the space future? Because this is NOT the future, it's fantasy for kids. Still, it can be irritating at times. Me, being a Norwegian, have often damned this appalling fact that one never makes genre series, like science fiction, for Scandinavian viewers. I never ever thought of the fact that this might have happened. But it did, actually, once, and even in my own homeland, Norway. I was two years old when the so called Fjernsynsteatret (TV theater section) of our national public service channel Nrk produced this three episode version of Blindpassasjer (The Stowaway).<br /><br />When I first heard of it, I was not surprised of the fact that until this day, the show has only been screened once in Norway, making it impossible for me to actually see it. It went on Swedish, danish and Finnish television also, in it's time, but that was a long time ago. There have been no video or DVD release of it, not a surprise either, and when it was screened on an art house cinema, this happened in Bergen, a city far far away from Oslo (where I live). And then there's another fact about «Blindpassasjer» that didn't surprise me, that it was written by the two Norwegian authors Tor Åge Bringsværd and Jon Bing (Bing&Bringsværd). This duo basically introduced the SciFi genre to Norwegians in the seventies; they published anthologies and wrote what they called fable prose. In my opinion, Bringsværd is the most interesting of the two writers, and has written several great and entertaining novels, masterpieces even, some of them hilarious, such as «Bazar» and «Syvsoverskens Dystre Frokost». No other than this guy, also an acclaimed dramatist, could construct the script of «Blindpassasjer».<br /><br />When I finally got to watch it, it was because a strange swede who recorded the three episodes on VCR in the 80's, eventually managed to transform it to DVD and give it to me. He was a nice bloke. So I sat down and watched it, with Swedish subtitles, bad sound and some scrapes and errors; but the thing came through and I was surprised that I eventually came to love it.<br /><br />The exterior scenes with the spaceships and planets are better than the ones in Blakes7, and the credit goes to Caprino studios (who made the famous Flåklypa Grand Prix), and the interior of the Marco Polo (the space ship) works better than I'd expected. The acting is typically theatrical, but it works better than when they play Ibsen, to put it mildly, and Bjørn Floberg carries his role solidly, as does Trini Lund. The legendary actress Henny moan delivers her lines in a serious and laid back tone which fits the genre, but this is an ensemble play, and I'm happy to say that Ola B. Johannesen carries his mustache with nobility, and Marit Østbye is a really hot space chic of my standards.<br /><br />But is it really that good? Well, one have to swallow the rather abrupt ending, the pretentious criticism of «modern society», but yes, it's, well, not really really really fantastic, but charming, cool, nostalgic and pleasant. One and a half hour of classic Norwegian SciFi.",positive

The main character's desire to reconnect with his Native roots? Or, more likely, it was his need to overcome his fear of death. But, he wasn't set up as someone who has lived his life in fear -- it seems as if his life was going fine, but since doomsday is approaching he should now start worrying. I didn't buy it. Meanwhile, the supporting characters in the film didn't seem to have needs that blended into an overarching story. They were all just doing their thing, running parallel to the main character. Also, what was treated as a ""curse"" looked more like a coincidence. Who cursed the family? Why? When? Finally, why didn't he just plan on staying in his apartment all day on his birthday? Those are my criticisms, but I did love the shots of Seattle, cinematography was beautiful, acting was good in the times it wasn't outstanding.",negative
"Not a bad movie at all, but probably the worst Marvel movie since Thor: Dark World. That's mostly because Marvel has been on point since Thor: Dark World.nnOne of the themes behind Captain Marvel's character is that she thinks she should suppress her emotions and this was a terrible idea. I'm not sure of it was the writing, the directing, or the acting, but this motivation made the character feel very wooden throughout most of the film, and generally unlikeable. Well directed action, a really engaging plot, satisfying character arcs, and Samuel L. Jackson did a lot to make up for this short coming, but it still left a stain on the experience.

"I'll start by relating my first encounter with Prince's music. It was in a bar, on my 39th birthday and a girl was dancing bare breasted to ""1999"" playing on the speakers. I asked people, who is this singer? I was told it was Prince. It was so good that it distracted me from a beautiful, topless dancer. Later I started hearing other Prince songs and really ""digging"" them. When Purple Rain came out I still knew very little about this fellow Minnesotan. The movie blew me away. I instantly became Prince's No. 1 fan of the ""War Baby"" generation. Later I found out one of my cousins was his secretary, and she got me, and my nephew into a V.I.P. Prince concert where we sat next to his mother...how cool is that! Getting back to the topic at hand, I agree with Siskel & Ebert who called Purple Rain an instant classic. I have seen it over 17 times and absolutely love it. I thought Prince's acting was fine, Apollonia struggled a bit, but all in all the acting was fine. John Gielgud was not available to play 'The Kid' so Prince took the role. The film is visually stunning, brilliantly paced (it never gets slow), and terrifically directed. I rank it among the Best Movie Musicals of all time. The last time I watched it was after about a 7 year gap and it still delivered. I am so proud of fellow Minnesotan Prince Rogers Nelson and would love to tell him personally.

The Indians decide to have a giant dog banquet (no, they are not feeding dogs, but feeding ON dogs) and when two Indians arrive late, there are not pooches left! So, they steal two dogs belonging to two orphans from the nearby White settlement and this actually touches off an all-out war!!!!

I don't know if American Indians actually ate dog, but it sounds like the sort of stereotype that later was applied to other ethnic groups. All this over dogs!

Unlike other marvel movies it felt super rushed like they were just using it as a quick backstory filler but failed to really engage.

"Meant to be some sort of a social commentary about the way that our lives were spinning out of control in the 1970's, this movie plays more like something Mr. Schlesinger threw together after having a bad day on the freeway. A mish mash of snippets about the nuts encountered along the freeway in Florida, and along the freeway of life, the cast is mostly wasted and probably ended up on the cutting room floor. The problem is that what DIDN'T end up on the cutting room floor probably should have! Now available on DVD, it's kinda fun to see a comedy that would have cost $100 million to produce had it been made in 2004. It rolls along and isn't too difficult to sit through, and, strangely enough, in 2004 we're all still pretty much just<br /><br />hopping in our cars and going faster and faster, heading nowhere.",positive

"I was a teenager when this first appeared in theaters, and I saw it in Japan. The film's plot wasn't my cup of tea as a high school sophomore, but I went to see it for the 3-D process. It had been ballyhooed in the press so that even service personnel overseas had heard of it, though it never screened at the Post theater.<br /><br />The film started the trend of throwing objects at the audience, which was taken to absurd levels with later 3-D films.<br /><br />I don't know whether this qualifies as a spoiler, but you've been warned if it is. In many films of the time, actors would often work in front of a ""rear projection screen,"" where backgrounds could be projected to make it appear that they were in a different environment, such as a jungle background when the actors were actually on a sound stage. This works well on regular films, but when seen in 3-D, they look like a flat scene behind the actors. There were several scenes in the film where rear projection was used, and it didn't work well in the theaters. If seen in 3-D, it will constitute another disappointment.<br /><br />The film's only importance is historical, since it was the first of its kind.",negative

"This movie is by far one of the worst B-movies I have ever seen. There are no plot twists at all. Though the acting is decent, the storyline is terrible. There are also many mistakes in the movie, and it was bothersome to watch. For any of you who like horror movies, slasher movies, or even B-movies, I don't recommend this to anyone at all. Most of the movie is focused on pointless killing, in ways that aren't even worth discussing. This movie could very well be compared to a crappy remake of Jeepers Creepers, which, too, wasn't that great of a movie.

"<br /><br /> I suppose this is not the best film ever made but I voted it at 10 stars all the same. Mainly because of my feelings at the end. I and all the people around me were simply touched. This is something you don't often feel . We are all getting a bit cynical and fed up with over sentimentality, lazy manipulation or preaching in modern films. The story of the film centres around Jane a young woman in the last stages of MND and the friendship that grows between her and Richard, a man on the verge of a breakdown. This could have so easily been a dull and worthy piece but it is so humorous, humane and lacking in sentimentality that it wins you over completely and against the odds is a feel good movie. <br /><br />The acting from Branagh and Bonham-Carter is superb especially the latter who is always believable and strong in her role. The chemistry between the two also lifts the movie. <br /><br />The title comes from Richards masterpiece, a plane made of junk and his old paintings. Flying here is a symbol for both Richards and Janes living life to the full so that one can carry on and the other can face the end. <br /><br />A beautiful and funny movie that I would recommend to anyone. don't let the subject matter put you off.",positive

The film is not the best Marvel film but it is definitely not the worst.  I enjoyed Larson's snarky, wry smile and her chemistry with Samuel L. Jackson was fun.  Mendelson was good.  I liked the mild twist in the latter half of the film.  What I did not like was the appearance of a McGuffin from an earlier, much better MCU film.   I also did not like the ret-conning of how Fury gets his eye-patch. (Dear Writers:  please respect the continuity from earlier films...).  As for an agenda, I simply didn't see it.

"Latcho Drom, or Safe Journey, is the second film in Tony Gatlif's trilogy of the Romany people. The film is a visual depiction and historical record of Romany life in European and Middle Eastern countries. Even though the scenes are mostly planned, rehearsed, and staged there is not a conventional story line and the dialog does not explain activities from scene to scene. Instead, the film allows the viewer to have sometimes a glimpse, sometimes a more in-depth view of these people during different eras and in different countries, ranging from India, Egypt, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, France, and Spain.<br /><br />The importance of music in Romany culture is clearly expressed throughout the film. It is a vital part of every event and an important means of communication. Everything they do is expressed with music. Dance is another important activity. Like Romany music, it is specialized and deeply personal, something they alone know how to do correctly. We are provided glimpses into their everyday activities, but the film is not a detailed study of their lives. Rather, it is a testament to their culture, focusing on the music and dance they have created and which have made them unique.<br /><br />Mr. Gatlif portrays the nomadic groups in a positive way. However, we also witness the rejection, distrust, and alienation they receive from the non-Romany population. It seems that the culture they have developed over countless generations, and inspired from diverse countries, will fade into oblivion because conventional society has no place for nomadic ways.<br /><br />The other films in the trilogy are Les Princes (1983) and Gadjo Dilo (1998).",positive
"I had a recent spectator experience with The Perfect Witness (2007) because the NetFlix computer recommendation engine suggested I watch this film. Apparently, at some point, I told it how much I liked Michael Haneke's, Benny's Video. I don't know about you, but this parallel being drawn provoked in me a maelstrom of emotion and excitement over Thomas C. Dunn's film and made the allocation of my time toward it virtually impossible to refuse. Just this kind of recommendation from the NetFlix computer intelligence, for me, had the aesthetic/moral movie bar set to level so high that, upon reflection, it represented something pretty much unaccomplished in every film produced in the year 2007.<br /><br />Having prefaced my response to the film that way, I'm going to proceed in knocking this picture down as poorly executed and banal; and I really hate to do that because I think our boy, Wes Bentley, happens to be not only one of the most interesting young faces in contemporary cinema, but also one its most overlooked and underrated screenacting talents in the US. I'm more than moderately concerned that the poor guy's going to miss the fame ship if he keeps fiddling around with first time movie directors like this.<br /><br />The Perfect Witness is about Micky (Wes Bentley), who, about thirty, still lives with Mom (""You're not drinkin' again area ya's?""), but he's a ""filmmaker"" or at the very least some kind of street-level voyeur with a pension for shooting would-be Johns in the seedy back alleys of Philadelphia with his DVX 100B. Out there, doing his private investigator-like drills, Micky ""inadvertently"" video-tapes a brutal murder on a hapless early-twenty-ish coed with his hand held camcorder. Baring the notion in mind that snuff and movies as cultural currency can be his equated with his ticket out of the white urban ghetto (and not to the debts of his unwitting friends and relatives who put up the money for his atrocious films), Micky approaches the assailant, James LeMac (Mark Borkowski: also takes a writing credit) or ""Mac the Knife"" whichever- and blackmails the killer into making a documentary about his murder impulses, holding this found footage over the attacker with threats of the police.<br /><br />The problem with this movie is not that no interesting ideas exist because they do. While both the writing and direction are amateurish, that alone doesn't make a film bad. It's that these guys commit a rather poor assumption that what they are presenting is shocking in the context of a culture in which just about any person in the free world with access to a private computer can log-on to the web and catch the veracity of the action of a beheading on their little Mac or PC. No film relies on shock value alone any more (unless of course, ironically, it's a film about torture on animals) and therefore cinematic images of violence (real or fake) have less and less cultural capital with each year that passes. Also, we've got this astounding actor-talent in the lead all styled-up, real hip guy: his two inch beard and skull cap with the little bill on it, backwards, just like the dork from high school who craved after the potential services of my primary love interest same guy who just now calls himself a ""poet.""<br /><br />Spare me. ""I'm an artist,"" ""I'm a filmmaker."" Okay. Please do, carry on with that shtick, Cronnie. Seems to have bought you a lot of expensive 35mm stock. And go ahead, you can wear all the accrutements of a ""creative"" but don't expect us top respond to you, to follow your below average character through your two hour movie while you take down Wes Bentley's career. Why don't we just let history speak to the merits of what you do, filmmaker guy. My guess is history will eventually have say something about that like, probably that's in not is good as you think it is. And yeah, odds are you'll be laying the blame on your dear ole ma, end up like our man Micky here in The Perfect Witness; hooked on smack and covered in your buddy's blood with a video camera in your hand.

"When I first saw this film around 6 months ago, I considered it interesting, but little more. But it stuck with me. That interest grew and grew, and I wondered whether my initial boredom and response had more to do with the actual VHS quality rather than the film itself. I purchased the Criterion DVD box set, and it turns out that I was right the second time. Alexander Nevsky is a great film. It is rousing, and I'm sure it succeeded in its main aim: propaganda against the Germans.<br /><br />That is the most common criticism against this film, and against Eisenstein, that it is merely propagandist and nothing else. It's untrue. He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived. By now, the world is far enough beyond Joseph Stalin to be able to watch Eisenstein's films as art.",positive
"While I am not a big fan of musicals, I have loved the films of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers because they are just so much fun. Sure, they can be a bit formulaic, but even though you KNOW what is going to happen, they still are very pleasing to watch. However, despite this, I was a bit disappointed in this outing. Part of it was because this film doesn't have the wonderful supporting cast like you saw in TOP HAT or SHALL WE DANCE. Without Edward Everett Horton or Eric Blore, the film seems to be a bit lacking--especially in the ""fun"" department. The silly antics of these supporting actors gave the other films charm that you just don't get with FOLLOW THE FLEET. In addition, unlike the usual character played by Astaire, this one is more of a jerk--as his fat head gets Rogers into trouble again and again. And, as a result, it's a lot harder to like him or want to see them get together in the end of the film. Plus, although the music is by Irving Berlin, the songs just don't seem as memorable. In fact, none of the songs were all that special and I can't recall any of them even though I just saw the movie. While this is still a cute and worthwhile film, it just lacks the sparkle and magic of some of their other films. Good but far from great.",positive

I watch this and it makes me sad for all the drivel the movie industry puts out and these beautiful little gems get passed over. Give Iphigenia a try and I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did. I have even gotten my children (27, 25, 20 and 17) to enjoy it. It starts slow, however, the drama builds and you will be drawn in to the story.

"This movie is in no way a ""bad"" movie, and definitely doesn't deserve the thousands of 1 star review that it has received. But on the same topic the movie also isn't in any way a ""good"" movie. Compared to other MCU movies we have seen it ranks far below average. But that's less of the fault of this movies inadequacy and should be pointed at our own expectations, were used to seeing the phenomenal movies from the MCU besides from a couple poor movies in the past including ""hulk"" and ""Thor 2"" but besides from the that the MCU have had amazing movies, but this movie in particular stops this momentum, I believe that's the fault of the main character her self being horrible blunt and narcissistic, multiple times while watching this movie I thought to my self how much I missed the humbleness of some of the other characters in the MCU. Another problem what the visual effects, they weren't bad and honestly compared to many movies outside of the MCU were pretty good but coming almost fresh out of infinity war I had high expectations. Another problem I saw was I found myself genuinely enjoying the time captain marvel herself wasn't on screen, which I feel just isn't the vibe I should be getting while watching her own movie. But I'm conclusion the movie doesn't deserve the hate nor the hype that is had gotten, once you shed away the politics of this movie is just your average movie, and my biggest hope is that his character doesn't stay the way she is, especially if she is going to be the new face of the MCU. And if she does stay the face I'm afraid I'll lose interest in the MCU and i really hope that won't happen.",positive
"Saw it twice this first week, and couldn't get enough of sassy Brie Larson perfectly cast as Carol Danvers (aka Captain Marvel). Her range runs from playful, to brash, to tenderness (when she re-connects with BFF Maria), and she's paired with a perfect de-aged version of Samuel L. Jackson in the setting of 90's culture (sets up priceless humor). Of particular note is the subtle but brilliant performance by Ben Mendelsohn as the Skrull's rebel leader. He should have his own Marvel Comic spin-off movie, opposite the ""hands down"" best character in the flick, Goose The Cat, whom steals the show. If you were one of the ""trolls"" rating this Marvel-lite (less calories) film less than 3-stars, might I respectfully suggest you go out and ""smell the roses"" despite it's thorns.

I almost liked this movie. There were fleeting moments of excitement caused by the colorful sci-fi action and nostalgic setting but I was never immersed in the story. I liked Carol Danvers but I was unable to sympathize with her plight because I never really understood her conflict.

"Yes, I was lucky enough to see the long-running original production of Michael Bennett's hit musical. It was an amazing experience and I paid to see the movie when it hit theatres back in 1985. It is awful. Almost everything fails. First off, Attenborough (a fine actor, a good director with the right material) is a sorry choice - almost as bad as when John Huston was hired to mangle ANNIE. The camera is always in the wrong place - they chop up the songs and the CASTING!!! They are awful - the power of the play was these dancers - these hungry, talented performers just wanted a chance to show what they could do and when they got their chance - you couldn't take your eyes off of them. But this cast just gets by dancing, does a ""nice"" job singing but none of them spark one bit. In fact, look up the cast on IMDb - none of them really went on to do anything much. (OK, OK, Janet Jones married Gretzky - sheesh). So this cinema trainwreck does not capture for one second the magic, the desperation, the passion of the stage musical. A total strike-out!

"Cameron Mitchell plays an actor who is dating a young actress who used to date the head of a movie studio (she's too young for both of them!). At a party, when he's lighting his cigarette, the studio boss throws a high alcohol content drink in his face, and he catches fire. In the hospital, his face is entirely bandaged and he still lights up a cigarette! He becomes the resident sculptor of the Movieland Wax Museum and Palace, where he also lights up cigarettes!<br /><br />Mitchell recovers, more or less, having really poorly done burn makeup on one side of his face that looks like gray spackle and tape, and an eyepatch. When Mitchell isn't smoking, he's killing people. Well, he only kills people sometimes, since he prefers to inject them with something that puts them in a sort of waxy coma. If he doesn't administer it regularly (and he never seems to remember), they start to move again a little, although they're in a sort of hypnotic zombie state. Not all his sculptures are people, though. He evidently does have talent as a sculptor.<br /><br />The ending, which seemed to have been struck from a much poorer print than the rest of the movie, is really absurd. They seemed not to know what to do, and went back to the title for an idea.

But like most of the MCU's heroes, it's nice that there was a bit of a background story behind CM 'coz I know nothing about her - as to how she is called the strongest superhero of MCU.  And after watching the whole film, CM has become my most favorite superhero next to Thor!nnMoreover, contrary to what the haters/bashers say where they review first before watching the whole film simply by basing their review from their co-haters' opinion, Brie Larson fit the role of Captain Marvel.  After seeing the way she speaks or carrying herself and what she stands for, I say, she is definitely perfect for the role. She's got some dry sense of humor and so is Carol Danvers.  So whenever I see her during interviews, there's only a minimal difference between Brie Larson and Captain Marvel minus the superpowers. Aside from that, I can sum it up that Brie Larson is definitely the Captain Marvel/Carol Danvers!",controversial

"For a number of reasons, I was very nervous for this film. I did not want to see any feminism/politics stuff brought into our beloved MCU. I want to get attached to reportedly our new leader of the Avengers after Endgame. Which is why this was one of the most surprising films I have seen this year so far.nnWe get our typical awesome Marvel action sequences though I felt that there were no really really good ones to look back on. There is a twist towards the 3rd act of the film that I really liked. The CGI on Samuel L Jackson was remarkable and he and Brie Larson had terrific charisma throughout the entire film and obviously both actors were really good in it. The emotion in the film was really good once we meet a certain character in the second act and those scenes actually hit me in the feelings which I love. Oh, and the credit scene has me incredibly hyped for Endgame. However this film isn't flawless and I do have a few gripes with it.nnThere are some bad CGI moments but not a lot. Reason I have to point it out is because of how noticeable it was for me. My biggest problems come with some of the editing and pacing in the beginning of the film that was really bad. As well as the way Nick Fury loses his eye. If you saw the winter soldier you know that line he says to Cap, The last time I trusted someone I lost an eye, yeah that line has no meaning now. As well as the way the Avengers get their name in the first place. There is also a confusing scene towards the beginning of the third act and a very poor music choice for a fight scene in the third act.nnNot a flawless film, but a very fun one nonetheless. I am going to give Captain Marvel a B+",negative

".I liked the movie and my son, daughter and wife liked the movie.  If you take the movie as it is, a marvel origin story movie, without all the preconceptions from the marketing and what was said before the movie, you will find a decent marvel movie I will put it in the same as Ant Man and the wasp.  Paul Rud might be a little more likable than Brie Larson but still good.  Both my kids liked the movie a lot and we enjoyed it as a family.  So in my opinion it served its purpose.  I look forward to seeing CM in End Game.",positive
"Easily one of the best superhero films Marvel has produced in ages. The ensemble films are always entertaining, but it was an unusually refreshing experience to return to a solo hero's origin story, reminiscent of the best of the ""Phase One"" films. Bonus: As much as this movie is a Captain Marvel Origin Story, its subplot is also very much a Nick Fury origin tale, with Coulson along for the ride as well. I was nervous about seeing these actors digitally de-aged, but the effects we're astonishingly nuanced and believable. I truly felt like I'd gone back in time.nnBrie Larson plays a compelling, emotionally complex Carol Danvers and it was wonderful watching her character sort out the mysteries of her past. She is easy to root for and frankly, a total badass. It was refreshing to see a movie that wasn't featuring an arrogant, egotistical character who gains power and somehow grows a conscience by the end of the film (Iron Man, Thor, Dr. Strange, Peter Quill...love 'em all, but there's kind of a pattern here.). Carol Danvers is her own, unique character with her own unique character development.nnI also commend the writing and directing for not saying away from the every day adversity women face from misogynysts without ever becoming preachy or overbearing. And in true slice-of-life fashion, for every man making a derogatory comment about a female pilot or a woman not embracing catcalling, there is an ally who treats women with respect and decency (Agent Fury for the win.). This movie has come under a lot of scrutiny for containing feminist themes so let me put it in these terms: there are heroes in this movie, and there are villains. There are both male and female characters in both roles. That, in my opinion, is equality in representation.nnAs far as plot goes, I was never bored. The story and action were consistently thrilling and/or interesting all the way through, from start to finish.nnIn short, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of either the superhero or scifi genre.",controversial
"It seems that it is becoming fashionable to rip ""Basic Instinct 2,"" to the point that a significant part of the audience (including critics) found it terrible even before it was released. It seems even more fashionable to trash Sharon Stone wholike all of usis now fourteen years older, andunlike most of usstill looks wonderful. First comments on this movie were so vicious that I had to see for myself. In my opinion, this sequel is not nearly as good as the original film, but is not as bad as most comments pretend. Michael Caton-Jones is not Paul Verhoeven, neither Henry Bean and Leora Barish are Joe Eszterhas. ""Basic Instinct 2"" is just an entertaining, average thriller, and besides the addition of Jerry Goldsmith original score, keeps little resemblance to its predecessor. Even Stone gives her character a different dimension, creating a lustful, devilish Catherine Trimell, who can perfectly well rank among other monsters like Hannibal Lecter. She is an intelligent actress who is not afraid of taking risks and can play with camp at her leisure. Unfortunately, she seems to be the main target for those who enjoy trashing this flick. She became too successful, too much of a main icon, and like all those actors who have reached that level, her time has arrived and she is now bound to be destroyed by Hollywood audiences.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is outstanding, giving performances that are far better than the material deserves. David Morrissey is a much better actor and by far more interesting than Michael Douglas: his acting is flawless, giving a dense, complex dimension to an otherwise one dimensional character. Since he has more screen time and is the axis of the movie, he can keep your attention from beginning to end.<br /><br />I am not recommending ""Basic Instinct 2"" as a great movie; I am just expressing my disagreement with most of the comments on this site and my conviction that agendas other than the movie itself are shaping the opinion of most spectators.",positive

A great job was done to show different settings for the Rom people.<br /><br />However, the viewer was not guided enough. A more in depth history of the Rom people would have been nice. Only a fraction of the of the spoken words were given English subtitles. In addition, more explanations about the settings and who was their and some of their challenges would have been appreciated too.

"Captain Marvel (4 out of 5 stars). Captain Marvel is the 21st MCU superhero film that introduces with another brief origin story of Carol Denvers (Brie Larson) who gets the power of energy projection and superhuman strength and becomes Captain Marvel. Captain Marvel film may not be the best in the MCU and may be a step backwards to being a fun origin story. The film is good. Brie Larson delivers the role of Carol Denvers. It does have a lot of action sequences and a proper brief origin story that focuses her getting stuck in an intergalactic war with two alien worlds such as Skrulls and the Kree. The direction and character development did feel a bit bland compared to every other superhero in the MCU. The review would be so spoiler free since there is a twist in the middle of the film. When Carol Denvers figures out the whole agenda with the bad guys motives and who her loyalties stand between the two alien races. The film does kick right into action with Carol having the abilities but does not know her true potential with her powers. There are flashbacks of her childhood and her motivation of standing up for what she is fighting for. When she falls onto Earth in 1995, we see a young Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). And Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg). They learn and figure out who she is and what the real threat is out there. She needs Fury's help to learn who she really is and trying to figure out what the villain wants. Brie Larson is great playing the character. I can not see anyone else playing her. Except the script of the film did make her character feel the least interesting hero in the MCU. Every one in the MCU had a moment to shine and had a little fun with the character. Carol Denvers is basically the Jason Bourne, with her broken memories of her past and trying to find where she fits in. It was not as fun compared to the others. The direction was also a bit bland with some forgettable action sequences. Almost similar to how the first Thor movie was. The climax of the movie was kind of exciting and spectacular. With Carol achieving her true potential of her powers and toying around with the bad guys while learning her powers with Just A Girl by No Doubt playing in the background. When more space invaders arrive and she flies to space to take them out. Which she becomes an unstoppable force that no one will even stop her was cool but there was not really much of a climatic battle. Samuel L. Jackson was good playing the young Nick Fury. Ben Mendelsohn playing Talos a shapeshifting Skrull is fun. Lashana Lynch playing Carols best friend was good but like I said the development between these characters were dull. Jude Law was good too as Yon Rogg who was Carol's commander in the Kree world. Some returning cast members like Djimon Hounsou, Lee Pace, and Clark Gregg were good too. Gemma Chan and Annette Bening were good playing brief characters. The visual effects were awesome and exciting. The film did have a comic relief of Goose the cat that is roaming around the air force base and tags along with Nick Fury. That is the most fun you will see in the movie. Overall, Captain Marvel is a good film. There is plenty of action to keep you entertained and visual effects. The cast ensemble was good. The plot was good for an origin story with the character finding her place. It may not be as fun compared to other MCU films with a bland direction and development with the characters. There is a mid and post credit scene. The mid is important which hints for the next MCU film which everyone is anticipating for and the post is just for humorous fun.",negative
"I was underwhelmed by this film. Larsen's acting was sup-par and the story line was weak. The villains in this movie were uninteresting and one dimensional. The changing of Mar-Vell from a man to a woman was also kind of silly as well. Why would you make such a powerful hero out to be an old woman? It seems Marvel is trying to appease the feminists, which will ruin the MCU. The MCU has been able to steer clear from the politicizing of culture, but I fear this is opening a sad chapter in the MCU going forward.",controversial

"Having just watched Acacia, I find that I have to agree with the negative reviews here. I like Asian, and Korean horror, and I had great expectations for this film. Man, was i disappointed. Watching this, I kept thinking ""surely they just do this to catch me off guard later on"", and for a while I expected something ingenious to happen. However, I slowly realised that the film really is that bad. It is the cheapest cash in into the Asian horror market I have seen so far. <br /><br />The basic story is perhaps not even that bad, but the way it is filmed it seems like the most laughable plot ever. The tree as a 'scary' device might be okay if used cleverly, but all the filmmaker does is giving us different shots of...yes, a tree, over and over again. He seems to hope that the tree will do all the work for him in terms of tension and build-up, but it just feels like what it is: shots of a tree. For goodness' sake!<br /><br />Slow build-ups can be very effective, and a film that presents the viewer with only few glimpses of what is wrong might deliver good scares, but not Acacia. Sure, we get a glimpse of a child on a tricycle disappearing around a corner, and, yet again, meaningful shots of the tree from above, or underneath, or the side, but these scenes are just not scary. They feel silly, especially because you realise that the director means them to be scary. They simply aren't. <br /><br />Apart from that I agree with some of the other reviewers, that the characters are ridiculous. In particular the one character's 'descent into madness' is laughable. However, what really breaks Acacia is the terrible editing. Its hard to see why scenes were cut together the way they are, but it's bad, and it kills any spark of interrest it might have had. It also makes me feel patronised, because I can see what they are trying to achieve with it, but I cannot believe that they think I would fall for such cheap ploys.<br /><br />There are lots of great Asian ghost films, and lots of bad ones, but this is by far the worst I have seen. They must have been going through the list of 'what to put into ghost movies', and ticked them all off, but in the end they forgot to add the actual movie.",negative

"I had high hopes for this movie but it was clear the writers or directors or both just didn't know how to handle this character. The movie went from a memory loss film, to a buddy cop movie, to alien invasion with a twist that was lacked importance. Then the twist became the driving force of the plot. Brie Larson's acting was disappointing and was carried by every other actor in the film. I loved Monica Rambeau especially. I was disappointed by a lot of decisions in this movie like how she got her powers and how Fury losses his eye. I'd rather Black Widow or Scarlet Witch take over as the female leader of the MCU. I care far more about those characters than I do about Brie Larson's Captain Marvel. Nothing in this movie truly made me want her to be the new lead of the MCU. I didn't care for this film or its decisions. However, I believe that it had some enjoyable parts but I wouldn't re-watch it. People can like this movie all they want but it just didn't make me care for it. The same way I didn't care for Thor the Dark World or Batman V. Superman. If you want to see a powerful woman coming to know herself and her strength, watch Wonder Woman. It made me care about Diana.",negative
"Not the worst Marvel movie I have seen, looking at you Thor: Dark World, but not a whole lot better. Failed to demonstrate the comedy the MCU is known for. Brie Larson didn't seem a right fit for a Marvel hero. The DC universe may be a better fit, Lord know they could use the help. It was neat seeing Fury and Coulson in their early days. Makes me wonder why Captain Marvel wasn't used in for the first two Avenger movies, why she wasn't consulted about the Accords, or helped out hunting down Hydra, but now we need a backstory movie before tossing her into the middle of Endgame. Maybe they will listen to actual criticism and improve the character, instead of blaming trolls and dismissing the problems.",controversial

It needed someone more in line with Scarlett Johansson I feel. nThe story is your basic, usual MCU story with nothing to add.

"I bought Dark Angel seasons 1 & 2 two weeks ago, after catching a couple of season 1 episodes on Channel 5. Nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is. I haven't enjoyed anything as much since Firefly (also and amazing show). I'll admit Season 2 wqasn't quite as good, but there are still some amazing episodes (see Designate this, Bag 'Em, the Berrisford Agenda, Harbor Lights, Freak Nation etc.) and Alec is great. I've heard some of the plans for the would-be season 3, and I have to say, I can't believe it was cancelled - I won't spoil it for you - but it would have rocked! I also think it has a lot of potential as a movie (although at the moment it seems highly unlikely). As proof of my obsessiveness, Max's barcode number is 332960073452, and in the two weeks I've had it, I am 3 episodes away from having watched both seasons twice. It's just too good.",positive
"Gender politics aside (which really aren't that big a part of the movie, although there are several overly obvious moments shoehorned in), the problem with the movie is what most other people have pointed out: the character just feels like an unjustifiably overpowered plot device, thrown in at the last moment to satisfy audience demand that Thanos has to be destroyed. Thing is, I'm not even sure if everyone was clamoring for that, and if they were, it's hard to tell why they would want Captain Marvel to do it. The character is pretty bland, frankly, while Thanos is anything but. Let's not pretend he was quite on the level of Heath Ledger's Joker, as far as charismatic villains are concerned, but he was certainly more interesting than anything else Marvel had put out. His victory over the Avengers wasn't just because of his own power, either, it was also the Avengers' hubris that led to their downfall. They had come to believe that they were an unstoppable force, and when they met an immovable object, their egos took over and prevented them from finishing the job. Starlord let his impulse for revenge ruin the best chance they had to get the gauntlet, and Thor didn't ""go for the head"" so he would have a chance to let Thanos know ""who done it."" Thanos was also a strangely vulnerable villain as well, not simply a stoic, impersonal force of destruction, a description that frankly, might apply better to Captain Marvel. If Thanos is simply beaten by superior force, it's going to be a pretty shallow ending, and a major cop-out to the moral quandaries that Infinity War raised, and that made it almost undoubtedly the best of the Marvel movies: do heroes fight for their own egos, or for the greater good? What do you do when you meet a power greater than your own? Do you keep trying to overpower it, or do you find another way? And if Endgame doesn't have any answer to these questions than ""you kick the bad guy's butt,"" then as far as I'm concerned the Marvel storyline ended with Infinity War, and that's where it  should have stayed.",negative

"Brie Larson is absolutely disappointing in this role. If this would have been a movie solely about her it would have been a lot worst. Thankfully for Samuel Jackson witts and goose the cat for his awesome performance and funny maneuvers which made the movie tolerable. The action is this movie mediocre and then the story literally slower than a snail in heat.  Could it have been the writers of this story or the acting or a combination of both that caused this movie downfall? But hands down to me worst movie of the MCU storyline.  nnCaptain Marvel is not a big name in the comics at least not anymore. rarely even seen in the comics unless it's a supporting character and when she finally gets a title it usually doesn't last a year.

"The Running Man is often dismissed as being just another Arnie action thriller full of explosions, bad puns and gunfire, and to be fair, there is a lot of that in it. People used to look at it and compare it to the Terminator series, saying it was one of the poorer Schwarzenegger films.<br /><br />But, give it 18 years, and you find yourself being able to appreciate it in a different light. Rather than just being another brainless action film, it works very well as a parody of reality TV. It is quite different to the Stephen King book, true, but I doubt whether Hollywood, with its love of upbeat endings and so-called 'ordinary guys' who turned out to have the skills of a trained commando, would have accepted it in its current form.<br /><br />But, on with the review.<br /><br />Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a cop working in a dystopian United States where democracy is a thing of the past, and the entire country is ruled by a government/media conglomerate amalgamation. The economy is in tatters, food is scarce and the state keeps people distracted by producing sadistic gameshows for them to watch, like Jumping for Dollars, where people jump for money over a pit of rabid dogs, and the most popular one is The Running Man, a gameshow hosted by the slimy Damian Killian (played by the entertaining Richard Dawson) where supposed 'criminals' are hunted down by theatrical, pro-wresting-esquire 'stalkers'.<br /><br />Some, however, try and speak up against the government. When a group of hungry people hold a protest in the town of Bakersfield, California, a helicopter piloted by Richards is sent to 'calm' (i.e. kill) the protest. When Richards refuses to fire on innocent people, he is arrested and framed for the murder of the people in the crowd. He is sentenced to a slave labour camp, but escapes with the aid of a resistance leader (Yaphet Kotto) and goes on the run.<br /><br />However, his freedom does not last long, and after he kidnaps network employee Amber Mendez (Marita Conchita Alonso) in an attempt to escape those pursuing him, he finds himself taken prisoner again, but this time he is forced to appear on The Running Man.<br /><br />And there, of course, the entire film kicks into standard Arnie mode. Richards is launched into the post-apocalyptic wasteland of Los Angeles (why is LA always destroyed in these dystopian worlds?) and forced to run from the 'stalkers', along with two other prisoners who escaped from the labour camp with him. Amber also becomes curious about Richards' protestations of innocence, and discovers he was framed. Guess what happens to her, then? So, as Amber, Richards and the two other guys run around trying to avoid the stalkers, we soon become aware that Richards is no ordinary cop. He's Super Arnie, the unkillable one man army who can collapse evil corporate dictatorships and fight obese men covered in Christmas lights all while being just your average American guy with an Austrian accent.<br /><br />Yes, the remainder of the film becomes dumb, loud, classic 80's Arnie fun. There's a lot of exciting fight sequences, the trademark dreadful puns ('He had to split' being my favourite), and the general formulaic final confrontation and happy ending. It's a lot of fun watching Killian react to it in the typical 'wholesome' gameshow host way, as well, and some of the funniest moments in the show revolve around the contrast between his interactions with the crowd as the seemingly benevolent host (watch out for the cursing old lady!) and the cold, cyncial man he is in reality who will do anything to increase ratings.<br /><br />If you expect a high-brow, intelligent film, you'll be disappointed. But if you want a great 80s flick, well, this is it. But the great thing about this film is it was quite prophetic.<br /><br />If you look at the entertainment we have today, you'll have noticed the way reality TV is going nowadays - shows featuring people willing to put themselves through anything for five minutes of fame, and producers all too willing to let them humiliate themselves on TV. It's not too far a leap to imagine that some vile TV exec out there has been trying to get the right to show people be executed live on TV. We've already had that, however, with the ghoulish al-Qaida hostage beheading videos posted on the internet. It seems that in the current climate, at least some people are perfectly fine with watching real death on their television sets.<br /><br />With that in mind, and coupled with the fact that everything these days appears to be a revival of the 80s, you have to be impressed by the far-sightedness of this film. Of course, we haven't reached there yet, as it's terrorists, rather than the mainstream media, who have bought us easily available programs featuring real human death, but you just have to wonder how long it is before some exec decides to see if he can find a way of pitching a show that combines people's desire for entertainment and desire to indulge their morbid curiosity...",positive

"What was there about 1939 that helped produce so many excellent Hollywood films? Well, whatever it was, the magic may also be found in this Columbia picture.

"I recently found this movie on VHS after looking for it for a number of years, I was not disappointed. It gets better every time I see it. Peter Ustinov stars and co-wrote the original screenplay (nominated for an Academy Award). Other stars you've heard of include Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Cesar Romero. Ustinov plays an accountant/embezzler, just released from England's infamous Wormwood Scrubs prison (he had embezzled from the Conservative Party headquarters, selected because he is a Liberal). He immediately begins a search for a new employer from whom he can embezzle, and discovers that computers are the wave of the future. He social-engineers his way into a London men's club and learns the identity of the best computer experts in town, he steals the identity of one Caesar Smith, who has just left town for South America to pursue his hobby of collecting moths in the wild. He talks his way into Ta-Can-Co, an American conglomerate headed by Carlton Klemper (Karl Malden). Klemper hires Smith and shows him around the computer center, especially its security feature consisting of a flashing blue light. Ustinov asks the computer how to defeat its security and the computer obligingly tells, him, ""Disconnect blue light."" Using hacking techniques from 30 years in the future, Ustinov breaks into the system and programs the computer to generate checks written to various bogus companies. The scheme starts to unravel when Klemper's assistant Willard G. Gnatpole (Bob Newhart) notices the amount of business Ta-Can-Co appears to be transacting with Ustinov's scam companies.

captain marvel is an amazing movie you can watch with your  mother and sisters they will love it!,positive
"I personally really liked Captain Marvel was it a bit safe of a movie, ya I would say so but not at all a bad film. In terms of pushing an agenda or being political out of the whole 2 hours and something run time there were only two scenes where I felt it appeal to feminist and even then it was not something to get me up and arms, one of the scenes just felt out of place like oh alright I get it the other was not bad at all I as a male even found myself enjoying just because of how fun and empowering that scene felt . Yet I will admit I thought it started off a bit slow at first but once they got to Earth it really kicked off for me, Fury and Carol Danvers relationship was among a hightlight of the film to me. I will also admit I was in the inital camp where trailers seemed a little bland to me so maybe it was cause my expectations were not so high, but I really was surprised by the movie. Brie Larson to me played and served the role well, there's obviously some growing to be had, but I cant wait to watch her grow into the character even more. Excited to see more of Captain Marvel.",controversial

"This was in the top half of Marvel movies. I get why people find her to lack emotion, but she still did just fine and looked the part. Although there were a few holes I think the story was great. And the movie was good enough that we spent most of the car ride home (and some time once we got home) taking about the ending and where a certain ""object"" from the film appeared in other Marvel movies.   The one thing with the movie that could have been improved was the music score. It was nothing to think of and if you asked me to hum the Captain Marvel theme, I'd say there either wasn't one or it was forgettable. for some of the other Marvel heroes I could hum it.",negative

I did not like this movie at all. The actors are doing the best they can with the material given but my biggest problem is the writing and direction. The film visually is dull and there's nothing visually appealing about it. The writing is atrocious most if not all of the jokes don't work which is rare for a Marvel movie and the pacing was off. I truly hope they give Captain Marvel a better director and writer for her next movie because she deserves better than this bland mediocre movie.,negative
This movie was wonderful! It's not preachy and it doesn't shove any opinion down your throat. Captain Marvel has a well developed personality and character. She isn't a token female character and she isn't a woman acting like a man. She's a person. nI enjoyed every minute. :),positive

"This is one of the best Marvel origin movies. It's so sad that so many Ă˘fansĂ˘? are purposely trashing this movies score. Of course not everyone will like this movie, but any rating 2 stars and below would be BS because this movie is absolutely better than that. This movie is so empowering. It's one of the most clever solo super-hero marvel movies in a long time. There are such great moments to empower Carol and the woman audience and they have a great emotional hold! Only problem I had with this movie was that I wanted to know even more about Carol/Captain Marvel and how she really felt at the end of the film, so you could say she was a bit underdeveloped in the third act. The greatest part of the movie is Carol finding herself and owning who she is. Two iconic lines in there. I'm so glad for this character and for all the girls that can look up to her. She is unmatchable in strength. To me she reminds me of my mother. Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Mendolsohn (my favorite character Ben has ever played/performed) give incredible performances! Quite possibly my favorite Marvel origin movie!

"Times are tough for Angel Town, gangs rule with an iron fist and for reasons mostly unknown (Mainly due to embarrassing writing) the gangs want a street kid, Martine to join the gangs, so they beat him up everyday. However due to the presence of an Olympic kick-boxer (Olivier ""World's lamest actor"" Gruner) named Jacques, hope is on the way. Angel Town is seriously one of the most inept message movies ever made (And I've seen my share) it seems to consist of the idea that all gang infested neighborhoods need, are French kick-boxers who can't act. Worst of all there are so many awkward moments it's just truly hilarious. Best of all comes from the exchange between Gruner and Aragon which basically sums up how ridiculous this thing is. To Wit: ""You like the fighting? (Olivier grabs his Asian best friend in a headlock) I could kill him right? When I want him dead he dies! The reason why I don't want him dead is because i'm afraid of him, and I know that if I kill him his son and wife will kill me, that's why he doesn't die!"" <br /><br />Of course the fact that it's wrong to kill someone, let alone your best friend is of course left out of the equation. Odd.<br /><br />However don't let me make this sound that I hated this movie, far from it, it's so terrible it's priceless. The biggest laughs come at the end in the disastrous finale which sees Grunner going one on one with gang-members who (the film's biggest logic gap)decline the use of pistols. Also a handicapped Vietnam vet helps out by shooting his machine gun at the gangs, while Gruner kick-boxes the rest. All of this set to the sound of horrible ""Mexican"" accents and surreal energy that make this one memorable for fans of cinematic trash such as this.<br /><br />The other treat about this movie, is that for some reason Olivier Gruner never attends college despite that's the main reason he's here in the states and not in France getting it on with his girlfriend (In a graveyard in the film's awkward beginning) Angel Town is without a doubt a failure on all conceivable levels but if you laugh at moronic martial arts movies with insane levels of action that make no sense on any level, this is the perfect movie for you. On the other hand make sure to down tequila, like the laughable opening song details ""Ain't no mercy in Angel Town"" <br /><br />* out of 4-(Bad)",negative
"Amazing Marvel solo movie! I'll place my review into several categories *spoilers*nPLOT - 4****nFor a solo movie, the plot was rather different to others. Seeing as it starts off with Carol already part of the Kree was unexpected. Also, then her being captured and her memories being searched by the Skrulls made them seem threatening. Later on, her meeting Nick Fury was cool. However, them being attacked by a Skrull so quickly left me wondering: how did it find them so fast? It's not like the Blockbuster was that close to the coast. And then the train scene was on point. I loved it so much, and it's so memorable. Plus Coulson being a Skrull so soon was much of a surprise to me. Furthermore, the idea of the Skrulls turning out to be the good guys was pretty unexpected, leaving me confused: at the beginning, they seemed as if they were building up to become the main villains but then suddenly it's actually the Kree that turned out to be the villains of the story overall.nACTING 4**** - nBrie Larson was a good choice as Carol. When she wore the red, blue and gold suit, she became so comic accurate it was unreal. However, the chemistry between her and her bestfriend was very plain and made their relationship seem unrealistic. Jude Law stole the show. He was amazing and the best actor in the movie, not to mention Ben Mendelsohn. His portayl as Talos was brilliant. SLJ was great, the humour not so much. Finally, seeing Clark Gregg back on the big screen after so long was fun and exciting. Goose also stole the show. nCGI 5***** -nI loved the CGI. Carol's suit was perfect, the scenery was at its peak and the de-aging tech used for Fury and Coulson made it seem so realistic and believable.nOVERALL -nThe mid-credit scene brought so much more hype for Avengers: Endgame than what it already has. The post credit scene was hilarious, although unnecessary. Stan Lee's tribute at the beginning brought a smile to my face and gave me a feeling that the movie would be good. And, guess what? It was! I'd recommend it to anyone anyday! Marvel Studios has successfully brought in another chapter to the MCU, good job!",positive

"I don't know what the Oscar voters saw in this movie, but they must of seen some pretty hard stuff to see in it to be able to award it with the best picture Oscar. All I know is that fortunately there was Gene Kelly to play in it or this would have been twice as bad as I believe it is. First of all, I don't think Leslie Caron was really fit to play such a role. She isn't that talented, she isn't a great dancer and she's not good looking at all. It's a shame that one actor or actress may ruin a movie just like by playing in it because if Leslie Caron hadn't been in this, it might have made a terrific movie. The story was intelligent, the directing wasn't bad, and, as I said, Gene Kelly was pretty good. Now I'm not saying all this stuff about Leslie Caron just to criticize her, I'm just saying it because I think that's what the worse part of the movie is. She's probably a good actress but I can't tell because I haven't seen her in anything else but I think she was pretty bad in ""An American in Paris"".

Well, I couldn't and so, I rented this mess of a movie.<br /><br />I had never heard of Ned Kelly and was surprised by what I found out about this young man's legend. I was also surprised at how mediocre this movie was. Perhaps the fact that it was very, very late and at the end of a 4 hour movie marathon or maybe it was because it really is a little slow, I found this story difficult to follow. Not because the story is complicated, but because it is slow. Even with a slow story, Ledger and Bloom managed to create interesting, dimensional characters. <br /><br />Though I flounder to recommend this as a must see, it is a great story of Australian history (considering how young the country is, this is very rare and should be appreciated) and the film does have some good actions sequences. <br /><br />6/10 see it for historical value....(yeah right...and that's the only reason to see it... ;) )",positive

"I had super high hopes for this movie based off the comics and what Marvel has been able to do in the past. I was unfortunately disappointed. Yes, Brie Larson was able to play the character pretty well, but the script just sucked. Somehow, Carol's entire origin story was overlooked and they decided to showcase the war that was happening between the Kree and Skrulls. Along with brainwashing her. We barely got  ten minutes of Carol's backstory, all told in flashbacks, and we didn't ever get to know her as a character. We're told the whole time that Vers is emotional and can't control herself, or her powers, yet we never really get to see this except for a couple zaps to Jude Law.

"""War is in your blood"" Rambo says early in the film, ""don't fight it"". Say, what? Is the scriptwriter taking the Mickey out of Sly? It is impossible for any person with a primary school education to miss the joke here. Yet, Stallone utters it without a hint of irony.<br /><br />The same lack of humour applies to the movie. Rambo IV is an over-the-top, idiotic actioner that would have been funny without intention if it weren't sickeningly violent. A redneck fantasy of the basest kind where villains are so villainous, it is not enough just to kill them  you have to dismember them with relish. Stallone stops at no blue-collar cliché to make his point. It is not enough for the chief villain to be feed-them-to-the-pigs, throw-babies-into-fire kind of sadist. He is also a pedophile homosexual.<br /><br />What is happening to IMDb? Is it taken over by the Rifle Society? How can this loathsome excuse for gross exploitation rate that high? I like a good action movie as much as the next man, but this is not entertainment  this is pornography of violence that trivializes and ultimately denigrates the real tragedy of Myanmar. The only good thing about the movie is that Sly doesn't take his shirt off. For this I will give it one star...",negative

"Went and saw this week with my wife. She and I are huge MCU fans, and while this movie did have entertaining parts, it was mostly disappointing. Carol Danvers in the comics was a straight to the point character, so Ms. Larson did well. no complaints on the acting. The Mar Vell character in the movie was a terrible disservice to the comics. In the comics Mar Vell was an intelligent military mind, genius level on earth, but not a full blown scientist of his species and the comic version death of Mar Vell was truly iconic. The movie version was a cheat. The man bashing was definitely there. It would be nice if politics was left out of entertainment. But the truly terrible thing is what was done with the skrulls.

"Overall decent movie; not horrible but not a masterpiece by any means.  Some of the 90s stuff is cringe (No Doubt song playing when it did, the Nirvana song being there at all because Kurt Cobain would've never wanted that if he were alive today), nn  Some of Brie's lines feel odd and her character in the movie has no growth arc.  The subtle-but-numerous feminist messages and nods throughout the movie either don't make any sense or play off poorly, and some of the retcons make absolutely zero sense.  Carol's powers don't have any intricacy to them and she just seems all-powerful because she just ""is"", which is kinda boring.  There is no villain in the movie who actually poses a challenge to her so it makes the fights weightless.nn  I'd say the real stars here were Samuel Jackson and Lashana Lynch, with honorary credits to Goose the cat and Ben Mendelshon as Talos.  It REALLY felt more like THEIR movie with Carol Danvers acting as a plot device and not much else.nn  Still though, it's a decent watch.

"This blast from the past carries a powerful message, but pulls it punches on plot. We get everything we've come to expect from a Marvel filmĂ˘""humor,  exciting action, energy blasts and a feel-good narrativeĂ˘""but the disappointing thing is how much potential was squandered in the storytelling and the plot. Don't get me wrong, this movie is fun, but Brie Larson carries the whole picture, and it could have been so much more had the rest of the film risen to match her performance. The plot lacks a strong setup, and relationship building is weak at best, passed over in favor of setting up Carol Danvers' (Brie Larson) powers. The strongest relationship in the film is the one that grows between . Danvers and Fury (Samuel L. Jackson),  whereas far too little time was spent building the emotional foundation for relationships between Danvers and her mentorsĂ˘""Jude Law and Annette BeningĂ˘""and much of the story is mired on the softly dealt mystery of Danvers' identity and the source of her powers. He almost gets lost in the mix, but Talos (Ben Mendelsohn) is one of the most well-developed and enjoying characters to watch in the film; if only the rest of the characters had that sort of depth to them. It feels like a script that went through too many drafts and carries the ghosts of plot threads left to whither, without fully embracing the structure they eventually built. Case in point: Fury being cute with cats. Where did that even come from? It doesn't even play well as a gag to show the tough guy having a soft-side for kittens, because... there's no setup for it, and thus minimal possible payoff. The film gives us a lot to absorb with little time to process: we've got Kree warriors, Kree Accusers, shape-shifting Skrulls, an early partnership between Fury and Coulson (Clark Gregg), and a classic sign of the 90's: ripped jeans. There are twists and turns galore, but for the most part they fall flat in moments that could have resulted in fanfare, while other momentsĂ˘""such as Danvers' realization of herselfĂ˘""are among the best we've seen from Marvel. It may have just been the theatre in which I was watching, but the cinematography was dull and colors felt muddled; not something we've come to expect from the MCU. The movie takes place in the 90's, and much has been made of the references (Blockbuster and RadioShack) and the de-aging done to Samuel L. Jackson and Clark Gregg (more distracting than it was impressive), but the time period is a background, much more novelty than nostalgia, that has no impact on the story, except to retcon Captain Marvel into the MCU so that she can join the next round of films. And when you look at this film as an opening act for Danvers in the serialized fiction of the MCU, the film absolutely marks one of the stronger feature lead debuts for a Marvel character to date, nestled somewhere in the range of The First Avenger and Ant-Man, but not rising to the heights of Black Panther. There is one sequence that defines the film, and the potential for it's message, when Danvers rises beyond the occasion and gets up after being struck down throughout her life. It's a powerful message audiences need to see, and it would make a tremendous cap to a short film or a tv spot, but it lacks the depth of a strong personal and emotional setup that a feature length film demands for such a moment, and despite all the cinematic wonder and the message behind the montage, the moment lacks the resonance it deserves, as does the film. Despite all this, and largely because of Larson's wit, this film is fun, so grab a bucket of popcorn, cast aside your expectations, and let Carol Danvers and her sidekicks take you on a journey fit for a rainy Spring day.",negative

This by itself is fine, it happens all the time with these 'reboots' of super hero movies However, my biggest complaint of the movie is that it felt like it was shoehorned into the Avengers line of movies rather than being something to stand on its own.

"Right away, this film was ridiculous. Not that it didn't have redeeming aspects For example, the best thing about this film was the beautiful background scenery. Anyone not living on the East Coast should know the South doesn't have beautiful mountains like those found in the West. I knew it was Utah right off the bat, but perhaps Dalton couldn't suppress his English accent, so they had to excuse it by saying this was a southern town. Subverting his accent into a Southern one was easier. Sure the film has plot twists, but its phony sense of place was something I couldn't get past. It's not like Utah doesn't have meth labs... so why the writers thought it necessary to pretend it was in the South is beyond me. <br /><br />One other thing in action pictures always puzzles me. Why do they always make the ""cocking"" sound effect when the character pulls out an automatic handgun? It seemed every other sound effect in this movie was a ""chuk-chich"" signifying a 9mm was loaded and ready to fire. Of course, the weapons already had rounds chambered so this was unnecessary. <br /><br />Lastly, the pyrotechnics were WAY over the top.

"Anyone who loves the Rheostatics' music is going to enjoy this film. I have some minor complaints, mainly about pacing and the casting of certain actors (not Maury) who aren't really convincing in their roles, but I don't have time write a detailed review. I just want to warn anyone who has seen this film or plans to watch this film as presented CBC television in Canada: The version that airs are the CBC is like the Reader's Digest version of WHALE MUSIC---don't watch it. It cuts out entire scenes and subplots (if you can them that) from the film. The CBC, which presents most of films untouched, took half the guts out of WHALE MUSIC. I don't know why. It's horrible what they did to the film. Rent the video or watch it in a theatre, but DON'T watch it on CBC television.",positive

"This movie gives golf a high mark, it was well acted and well directed. Giving you a view of history that some non-sports fans will enjoy. The historic factor alone gives it a high rating, the Brookline golf course was really done well. I am in the northeast and have seen Brookline as a fan, and as someone who loves the game. The movie was well done on all levels. A MUST SEE 5 stars. The acting was superb, Disney has another winner in its bag of Great movies. If for no other reason watch the film to give hope and encouragement to young people whom may not see the hope in their life. I would tell you that the setting, while in the late 1800's and early 1900's is very realistic. The costumes and dialect were right on the mark as well. Above and beyond the call of duty for a golf film. A Must see for fans and non-fans alike.",positive

"SPOILER-FREE REVIEWnnNot good, but not awful either. I was wary of this movie going into it because i'm a huge comics fan and Carol Danvers in the comics is, uhh, let's call her questionable. She has plenty of strengths and weaknesses that come back to bite her and I was wondering how the movie would handle that. Turns out they just cut out a portion of her personality flaws, which i think makes it better if they want to make her central to the MCU.nnThe reason I give this movie an overall down rather than an up is that every single actor and their portrayal in this movie was good EXCEPT for Brie's. She seemed bland and failed to emote even in very emotional scenes. Her side actors were much more emotional and dynamic. The buddy comedy between Danvers and Fury felt more like Fury being a buddy and Danvers being a mannequin. i don't know what happened to her because she did well in other movies, but it seems like she just didn't have chemistry with any of the cast. It wouldn't be as much of an issue if she were a minor character, but because she's the main character the lack of chemistry was painful and jarring. nnIt's really hard for me to be so negative on it because I love the storyline. The Skrill are some of my favorite side-race portrayals in the entire MCU, but Brie's acting was just so bad for me.nnThere is one amazing thing though, and that is Goose the Cat.",negative
"They definitely  miscast Larson for this role, she is bland with no character or personality. Probably the worst marvel movie to date.

"This film tackles the subjects of loss, personal struggle and transformation in such a smart, artful, sensitive, and visually stunning way that I was completely transported. It is a rare gem of a film in the way it honors beauty and women. You'll have to see for yourself. Dreya Weber (Jane) masterfully portrays the subtleties of a remarkable if not somewhat broken personality, in a way that every woman will relate to. I found the honesty of the emotional interactions among characters to be very refreshing and profoundly engaging. There was nothing in this film that said to me ""low budget"" as far as quality is concerned. Nothing. The fact that it is a low-budget film is a tribute to the film's creators. The final sequence during the credits will also knock your socks off. It is a brilliant celebration of Jane's choice. Unexpected and inspiring.",positive

"A wonderful film, filled with great understated performance and sharp, intelligent dialogue. What really distinguishes the film, however, is that undercurrent of sadness throughout. The story is underscored by affairs, loneliness, suicide, disappointment, the fear of losing ones job in a world where that had disastrous consequences. Most of all it was set in a world that no longer existed, having been ripped apart by the beginning of World War II. In fact, the film is barely a comedy at all if you compare the percentage of serious scenes to the comic scenes. Yet funny it is--listen to Margaret Sullivan's harsh dismissal of Jimmy Stewart and watch his pained expression as he replies that her comments were a remarkable blend ""of poetry and meanness"". It's funny, pointed, and sad all at once. A remarkable achievement and one of the ten greatest screen comedies ever made.",positive

"This totally odd-ball feature is a typical and prime example of satanically shocking 70's horror. The events are thoroughly confusing and it takes up quite a while before you figure out what the hell is going on, but the brooding atmosphere sucks you in immediately. Right from the indescribably bizarre intro, showing a couple of eerie children turning toys into real-life war machinery, you just know this become an uncompromising and gritty shocker. ""Brotherhood of Satan"" soon appears to be another installment in the alleged & unofficial ""creepy little town hiding a dark secret"" sub genre. A young widower, traveling with his new yummy girlfriend and 8-year-old daughter, stops in a remote little town to report a car accident they witnessed on a nearby highway. The villagers behave very hostile and insist the visitors on leaving right away. The town clearly bathes in an ambiance of fear and panic, as local children vanish inexplicably vanished and unnatural forces maintain everyone within the boundaries of town. Hillsboro is in the grip of a satanic cult, apparently ruled by the elderly members of the community. I really liked ""Brotherhood of Satan"" a lot. The story reminded me of a novel written by John Saul, but I can't remember the title. It also dealt with a cult of elderly people abusing youthful villagers for their own greedy merits. The film mainly relies on creepy scenery (like dolls and witchcraft relics) but a slightly more involving and coherent screenplay would have been nice. The subject matter often raises a lot of issues and questions, and director Bernard McEveety can't always provide us with answers. The climax is terrific, very seventies (meaning shocking) and unforgettable. Beautifully shot film, too.",positive
"While Captain Marvel does contain some rather too obvious feminist allegory, this definitely does not detract from the quality of Brie Larson's performance.

"This is really bad, the characters were bland, the story was boring, and there is no sex scene. Furthermore, it lacks drama, the conflict is minimal causing it to be extremely slow paced.

The couple invite the stranger to stay with them, because he is homeless. At this point you would expect the stranger to have sex with the wife right? No they just kiss and thats it.

"This is my SPOILER-FREE Captain Marvel movie review.nnIt's an origin movie and at times was a bit slower paced than the usual Marvel movie, but the slow pace was to allow room for character development. I think this is acceptable for an origin movie, think of Wonder Woman for example, or Spiderman Homecoming.nnIt has more chick flick elements (don't worry, no romance) than some die hard superhero movie fans might like, but that said, all my die hard geek crew who have seen it have loved it. It certainly has action, special affects and arse kicking a plenty. But it also has a few tear jerker moments. It does push a message of female empowerment, but it doesn't do it at the cost of the story. Nothing feels forced. And it's not anti-male, not even the slightest.nnThe plot has a lot of elements woven together, and the movie pulls that off without losing the audience in the process.nnI thought it was similar in pace (though a different franchise) to Aquaman.nnThere were some plot sequences which were a little contrived and were 'plot-conveniences' ie had poor exposition. But tbh this is something that all movies especially superhero movies are guilty of. Overall the script was solid and most stuff made sense and didn't feel made up just for the convenience of moving the plot along. An example of a movie that was really quite bad at pulling immersion breaking plot contrivances is Ant Man 2 (I enjoyed it, but it was a pretty mediocre movie). Captain Marvel was light years beyond Ant Man 2. I mention Ant Man 2 because some people have compared the two and they don't compare in the slightest.nnThere are some great pop culture references in the movie - but I'll leave those for people to discover themselves. Especially since some are a bit spoilery.",positive

Where it stumbles is in the lack story development to the overall MCU arch (we know how this one is going to begin, and we know how it ends...which is how it's presented to the audience). It also suffers from the movie faux pas of undercutting it's own characters (e.g. Nick Fury and Ronan the accuser) in order to accomodate newer more ''meaningful'' characters but at the expense of things previously established.  Where the movie does well is in the actors.  Brie Larson is good, Samuel L.Jackson is very good, and Lashana Lynch is incredible!

The screen is filled with a dynamic presentation that rivals all other musicals including the outstanding ones by Rodgers and Hammerstein. Be sure to ask for it an your video supplier.

No identity stuff either way, just purely asking if it was a good movie or not. I think it's a good movie. About as good as Thor 2 or iron man 2. Not the best, but all marvel movies are pretty fun. nnLastly, RT shouldn't have removed bad reviews. Many of them are petty, but certainly not all, and who are they to decide?

"""Murder Over New York"" is an entertaining entry in the Charlie Chan series of films, but if you're paying attention, a lot of plot holes reveal themselves to the observant eye. While traveling to New York City for an annual police convention, Chan (Sidney Toler) meets former Scotland Yard investigator Hugh Drake (Frederick Worlock) on the same flight. Now employed by military intelligence, Drake is tracking Paul Narvo and his Hindu servant, suspected for acts of sabotage around the world. Drake believes that by contacting Narvo's elusive wife, he'll be able to pin down the whereabouts of the master criminal.<br /><br />When Drake winds up dead in the library of George Kirby, president of the Metropolitan Aircraft Corporation, Charlie theorizes that he was killed by a recently discovered poisonous gas called ""tetrogene"", administered via a glass pellet that releases the poison when broken. Summoning Kirby to bring all of his dinner party guests together, Chan and Police Inspector Vance (Donald MacBride) question those in attendance, as one of them may be the killer. Among them are Herbert Fenton (Melville Cooper), a fellow Oxford student of Drake's, actress June Preston (Joan Valerie), unknown to Drake but requested by him to attend, Ralph Percy (Kane Richmond), the chief designer at Kirby's aircraft company, and Keith Jeffrey (John Sutton), Kirby's stock broker. Kirby butler Boggs (Leyland Hodgson) is also a suspect, especially after Number #2 Son Jimmy (Victor Sen Yung) catches him steaming open a cablegram, the contents of which concern Boggs himself.<br /><br />There are some other cleverly planted characters in the proceedings as well. Mrs. Narvo turns up as Patricia West (Marjorie Weaver), and contrary to Drake's suspicion that she might lead him to Narvo, is actually on the run away from her former husband and a disastrous marriage. She's involved with David Elliott (Robert Lowery), principal of a chemical research firm, and thereby a suspect in the tetrogene angle.<br /><br />As with many Chan films, racial comments must be taken in stride with the proceedings. This one offers two glaring ones. When Kirby's black servant is brought in for questioning, he states that he doesn't know anything about Drake's murder, that he's completely ""in the dark"". Chan's response: ""Condition appear contagious"".<br /><br />Later, following Inspector Vance's order to round up all the Hindu's in New York, Jimmy Chan comments on their arrival with ""They're all beginning to look alike to me."" Actually, the scene provides one of the elements of comic relief in the movie, as Shemp Howard impersonates Hindu mystic ""The Great Rashid"", but is actually uncovered by the police to be con artist Shorty McCoy.<br /><br />Before the movie's over, two more victims fall to the clever Narvo - his confederate Ramullah, and aircraft magnate Kirby himself. To uncover the killer, Chan, in concert with Elliott, arranges for a test flight aboard a newly developed TR4 Bomber after discovering a poisoned capsule planted by mechanics on the plane the day before. Before it can release it's deadly poison, the Brit Fenton catches the falling capsule in mid-air, revealing that he knew about the plant. Arrested and brought in for questioning, Chan asserts that Fenton is not Narvo. The real Narvo reveals himself when he offers a poisoned cup of water to the nervous Fenton, anxious to maintain Narvo's secret. But Chan was clever enough to be wary of such an attempt, and reveals the real murderer - Narvo now in the guise of stock broker Jeffrey, having undergone reconstructive surgery following a car accident.<br /><br />Now for the plot holes. When first investigating Hugh Drake's murder, it was maintained by the police that fingerprints found in the library did not match those of any of the dinner guests. However Jeffrey/Narvo was present at the dinner party. It had already been established that Drake had one non party visitor in the library, chemist Elliott. If the fingerprints really did not belong to Narvo, then making them an issue was pointless.<br /><br />Also, at the end of the film when Narvo offers Fenton the poisoned water, how did he think he would get away with it with everyone there as a witness? But going even one better than that, how would a world traveling saboteur like Narvo have the time and wherewithal to establish himself as a New York City stockbroker, it just doesn't make sense. <br /><br />For trivia fans, a few more points bear mentioning. In the film, Number #2 Son Jimmy is a college student studying chemistry as he comes to ""Pop's"" aid to solve the case. In the prior Chan film - ""Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum"" - Jimmy was a law student.<br /><br />The poison gas formula would get reworked in a later Chan film, this time by Monogram with Roland Winters in the Chan role in ""Docks of New Orleans"". In that story, poison gas is released from shattered radio tubes in similar fashion to claim its' victims.",positive

"'How to Lose Friends and Alienate People' is an entertaining, if loose, adaptation of Toby Young's memoir of the same name. It's also a great title for helping to fill up the line requirement in IMDb reviews! The basic gist is the same as the book with certain incidents dramatised, but a romantic plot is added and the ending is certainly Hollywoodised. Simon Pegg, despite playing an essentially irritating person, is his usual likable and funny self and pretty much carries the film. Strange to think only a few years ago he was just a TV sitcom guy and now he's rubbing shoulders with Hollywood names. There's a good supporting cast and it's an amusing, easy watch - kind of a male 'Ugly Betty', but funnier.",positive
"I really wanted to like this movie, but the truth is that Captain Marvel is a mediocre film, at best. Slow-paced, boring plot, not-so-funny jokes... but to me the worst part was the fact that the voice, expressions, and overall demeanor of Brie Larson was a complete letdown. I felt more connected to Talos as a character than to Carol... and i believe that says a lot. I know there has been a lot of controversy around this movie, because of the comments of the lead actress, but putting all that aside, this movie in itself is, unfortunately, one of Marvel's worst so far. This movie can't even be compared to other female-led movies like Wonder Woman, and that's just sad; other recent movies, like Alita,and even Bumblebee  were much more successful on presenting a female leading role in a way that felt connected to both the story and we the audience. When you see Wonder Woman, you simply forget that Gal Gadot  is an actress... you feel like she IS Wonder Woman, but when you see Captain Marvel, you are -0% aware at all times that Brie Larson is just an actress attempting to portrait Captain Marvel (and failing miserably)... she's just not convincing enough; to me, this person is simply NOT CAPTAIN MARVEL. I really hope they seriously consider doing a recast, as they did with The Hulk. We are talking about a very important figure here, the character that is supposed to be be leading the MCU moving forward, filling the shoes of RDJ (who by the way, you feel like he IS IRONMAN, on and off camera). I have no doubt that Marvel will fix this mess... they managed to fix Thor (1 and 2 were garbage, then they gave us Ragnarok, and all was good). I'm definitely looking forward to Captain Marvel 2, but i really, and i mean REALLY hope they do a recast, and give us a worthy leader of the MCU for the next decade.",negative
"This is a prime example of a tell not show plot.  There is tons of exposition telling us how great of a person Carol is, but she really does not get a chance to show that greatness.  Her powers are scaled far to high, considering that she is able to destroy a vessel with one hit that an entire planetary defense force of an advanced civilization could only slow down for a few moments.  Lazy writing that will result with ongoing issues for the MCU.",negative
"Beautifully filmed, well acted, tightly scripted suspense movie. Had me on the edge of my seat. I liked the lead actress very much, and thought the villain was very well done. Not much to chew on here in the way of a theme, but if you just get in your seat, turn your brain off, watch the fancy camera work, and enjoy the plot, you will have a great time. The plot is well worn, and regular movie goers will probably know more or less what to expect by about ten minutes in. But that didn't bother me, as I enjoyed watching it unfold. In the old days, they might not have focused so tightly on just two characters, and there were some enticing moments when I hoped they were going to let some other people have a few lines. But these folks were probably right to keep the movie so tightly focused. The plot got me by the throat fairly early on, and never let go. It's not a good idea to think too much either during or after the movie. as I'm not sure it makes a great deal of sense. Just sit back and enjoy.",positive
"Just saw Captain Marvel! A pretty balanced and funny movie!! 3.5/5 stars for me! It's missing more familiar faces for me, but I've only seen like 6 marvel movies so far, and the story lacked originality and was really cliche 1/2 1/2 1/2 (C). My real problem with it is that it felt like Black Panther, like it was addressing women (while Black Panther addressed colored people,) and didn't come into being because it was good.

Kind of like older superman stories, where he was literally unbeatable.nnAt some point in the movie I started theorizing if she actually fused with the reactor's technology, rather than just absorbing it's power and became partially android, which would make her better/stronger in many ways, but less emotional and possibly susceptible to some sort of EMP attacks. I expected the enemies to figure it out and use it against her, but by the end of the movie I realized, that she just that excellent...nnThe story kind of explores missing memories to add a twist to the backstory, but doesn't really take it anywhere interesting. I was hoping to see some sort of a plot twist when her memories come back, or at least some sort of a mystery, that would add to the character building.nnIf this is how this character is supposed to be, and not just bad directing, I don't think I am interested in it. nnThe Goose was really intriguing (it barely makes a few appearances, but it already has mystery and character to it), so I hope it appears more in later movies.",negative

"This so-called ""documentary"" tries to tell that USA faked the moon-landing. Year right.<br /><br />All those who have actually studied the case knows different.<br /><br />First of all: there is definitely proof. When the astronauts was on the moon, they brought back MANY pounds of rock from the moon - for geological studies. These where spread around the world to hundreds of labs, who tested them. And they all concluded that they came from the same planet, not earth: because the inner isotopes of the basic elements are different from those found on earth, but similar to those calculated to be on the moon. I.E. the conspiracy theorists never studies anything: they only take the thing that fit into their theory and ignores the rest.<br /><br />Another wrongful claim from them is that their was wind in the hangar where they shot the moon landing, I.E. the flag moves. There is a logical explanation: the astronaut moved it with his hand, so it moved. And what proves this: well, if the conspiracy theorists even studied the footage, they would see that the flag NEVER moves after the astronaut have let it be, I.E. the conspiracy theorists are bad-scientists, they cant study a subject properly, or only studies it until they have what they came for, so that they can make a lie from that, and make a profit (I.E. this so-called ""documentary"").<br /><br />A claim says that it cant possible have been filmed on the moon because all the shadows come from different places, because there are different light-sources, the artificial lighting from the studio. Once again the conspiracy theorists are wrong (as usual), the same would happen in an earth desert at night, with no light-sources. But i doubt that any Conspiracy theorists have ever been outside their grandmothers basement for more than how many days a Star Treck-convention is held over.<br /><br />The Conspiracy theorists are in denial, BIG TIME. They only see what they want to see. So they make up all these lies to seem important - that is a fact.",negative

"""The Beguiled"" is a strange work among Clint Eastwood's oeuvre. By 1971 he had become well known as the star of action movies, not only Westerns (the genre in which he first made his name) but also war films (such as ""Where Eagles Dare"") and cop thrillers (such as ""Coogan's Bluff""). Yet although ""The Beguiled"" takes place during wartime (the American Civil War), and was made by Don Siegel who had earlier directed Eastwood in ""Coogan's Bluff"" and was later the same year to direct him in ""Dirty Harry"", it is not an action film in the traditional sense. In most of his previous films Eastwood had played an active role, but here his role is largely passive- his character, Sergeant John McBurney, is a wounded fugitive forced to rely upon the charity of women in order to survive. Even while serving with his unit, McBurney played no active part in the conflict; he is a Quaker, whose religious principles forbid him to bear arms, and was serving with the Union forces as a medical orderly. <br /><br />The film is set in Louisiana towards the end of the war and starts with the injured McBurney being discovered by a young girl named Amy and brought back to her boarding school. The school is a small one, with only two teachers and a handful of girls. Although some of the girls are ardent supporters of the Confederate cause and want to hand him over to the authorities, the headmistress, Martha Farnsworth, decides to shelter him and tend him, fearing that his injuries are likely to prove fatal should he be sent to one of the Confederacy's notoriously harsh prison camps. <br /><br />Although McBurney scrupulously follows the teachings of his religion as regards pacifism, he is not so scrupulous when it comes to following its teachings on the sin of fornication, and as he starts to recover he makes full use of his opportunity to exercise his charms on both the staff and the older girls, and he wins the affections of number of them, including Miss Farnsworth, her assistant Edwina and Carol, one of the older girls. Even twelve year old Amy appears to have a sort of childish crush on him. In the sexually repressed atmosphere of the all-female school his presence gives rise to jealousy and hatred, and Miss Farnsworth, rejected in favour of the sluttish Carol, plots a terrible revenge. (Interestingly, the one female to resist McBurney's blandishments is Hallie, Miss Farnsworth's black slave, even though he tries to win her round by pointing out that he is fighting to free people like her). <br /><br />""The Beguiled"" has been described as an anti-war film, but this seems to me to be a misconception. The film is not really about the rights and wrongs of the Civil War or of war in general. The only acts of violence we see are perpetrated by non-combatants, and they are motivated by a desire for personal revenge, not by zeal for the Confederate cause. It would be more accurate to see the film as a drama about the psychological stresses that can be caused by the peculiar circumstances of war. <br /><br />At the beginning the school, set in a beautiful old antebellum mansion, seems like an island of peace amid the war. The building is in the Classical style, associated with order, harmony and restraint, but the story that unfolds within its walls is one of disorder, passion and violence, qualities associated with the Gothic school of writing which in the 19th century was often regarded as the antithesis of Classicism. The film can be seen as falling within what has been called the ""Southern Gothic"" tradition in American film and literature. <br /><br />The film was not a great hit at the box office, possibly because Eastwood was cast so much against type. It is not perhaps his best film, but it did show that he could expand his range and play something other than action heroes. (In ""Play Misty for Me"", his first film as director made the following year, he was again to play a ""passive"" character in danger from a vindictive female). There are some very good performances from the female members of the cast, particularly Geraldine Page as Martha Farnsworth, outwardly a respectable middle-aged spinster but inwardly a woman of strong passions. (There are hints that she may have been having an affair with a man whom she passed off as her brother). There are also good contributions from Elizabeth Hartman as the shy, repressed Edwina, who falls in love with McBurney and rejects the idea of revenge and from young Pamelyn Ferdin as Amy. (Amy is an animal lover- a key moment in the film comes when McBurney kills her pet turtle- so it is interesting that in later life Ferdin became an animal rights activist). The one character I was less keen on was Jo Ann Harris's Carol who seemed too modern, like a swinging seventies chick transported back in time to the 1860s. The film is notable for the emotionally intense ""hothouse"" atmosphere which Siegel brings to it. This will not be a film which is to everyone's taste; some will find it too overwrought and melodramatic, and some have found it misogynistic. (Judith Crist called it a film for ""woman haters and sadists""). Others, however, may find it a compelling psychological drama. 7/10",positive

However Richard Attenborough commits something akin to a crime by making GREY OWL a serious drama . Worse , he`s made an extremely dire film too . Pierce Brosnan lacks the charisma needed for the title role and the romantic subplot between Grey Owl and Pony ( Played by the equally wooden Annie Gaupeau ) lacks any type of on screen chemistry . But to be fair to the cast their not helped with the script which fails to portray Archie as the cheeky chappy he is of fooling everyone into believing he`s a native American . The producers and screenwriter have made the major error of having the film centre around the plot twist of Archie being an Englishman - That`s why I wrote "" Possible spoiler "" it`s not actually revealed untill late in the film that the title character is English , but it`s obvious that everyone who viewed this movie knew that beforehand hence there`s absolutely no surprise involved.<br /><br />Yes I do agree with everyone that the scenery is lovely and that it has a deep ecological message which isn`t actually a new concept . Theodore Roosevelt was the first important environmentalist of the 20th century if truth be told .

The films biggest issue is a scattershot presentation that feels like it can't decide what it wants to be, 90's nostalgia fest with Nick Fury comic relief or a massive space drama with galaxies at stake. The fight scenes, save one, aren't particularly memorable, photon blasting everything in sight kind of becomes a blur. Carol Danvers arc is solid, even inspiring, but the way it's presented sucks the life out of it, rather than seeing a real progression we're fed flashbacks and exposition that culminate in a pretty typical power moment. I wish this had been handled better because I think the direction made Brie Larson play a far less compelling version of this character than she's capable of, who knows, maybe things'll be different in Endgame. For all my gripes, the movie is still fun overall with a fair amount of laughs and a strong supporting cast, especially Samuel L. Jackson. Ben Mendelson's Talos honestly saved large sections of this movie from being a total drag. The movie also very overtly wants to be a hero story for little girls who get told they're not good enough, and in that at least, I think it succeeds.nn6/10 Decent",positive
"There's the danger with the critic/philosopher Slavoj Zizek with his film, directed by Sophie Fiennes, which takes together a wonderful amalgam of silent, horror, sci-fi, surreal and other contemporary thrillers together to make his points ofr Freudian comparisons to overload. But in the Pervert's Guide to Cinema he also makes even the more far-reaching points a point of departure from any other analysis I've seen on a collective section of films. While it doesn't cover the expansive territory Scorsese's movie documentaries cover, the same attachments are there, and Zizek has a definite love for all of these ""perverse"" examples and films, primarily the work of Hitchcock, Lynch, Chaplin and Tarkovsky. Yet one shouldn't go into seeing this- if you can find it that is, I got to see it almost by luck- thinking Zizek will just try and dissect all of the psycho-sexual parts or parts referring it in an obtuse, deranged manner. If anything he opens up one to points that might never be considered otherwise- would one think of three of the Marx brothers as representations of the Id, Super-Ego and Ego (Harpo's example is most dead-on for me).<br /><br />He's not just one to take on the classics though, he also considers the food for thought in The Matrix and Fight Club- in representations of the split between fantasy and reality and if the matrix needs the energy as much as the energy needs the matrix for the former, and in the attachment of violence in dealing with one's own self as well as ones double in the latter. He even throws in a piece from the pivotal moment in Revenge of the Sith when Anakin becomes Darth Vader, and the implications of shunning away fatherhood under that back mask at the very moment his children's births happens elsewhere. The ideals of fatherhood, male sexuality, the male point of view in turning fantasy into reality (at which point Zizek rightfully points to as the moment of a nightmare's creation), and female subjectivity, are explored perhaps most dead-on with Vertigo. This too goes for a scene that Zizek deconstructs as if it's the Zapruder film, where he dissects the three colliding points of psycho-sexual stance in the 'don't you look at me' scene in Blue Velvet.<br /><br />Now it would be one thing if Zizek himself went about making these sincere, excited, and somehow plausible points just face on to the camera or mostly in voice-over as Scorsese does. But he goes a step further to accentuate his points of fantasy and reality, and how they overlap, intersect, become one and the same, or spread off more crucially into some netherworld or primordial feeling for some characters (i.e. Lost Highway) by putting himself IN the locations the films take place in. Funniest is first seeing him in the boat ""heading"" towards the same dock Tippi Hedren's boat heads to at the beginning of the Birds; equally funny is as he waters the Blue Velvet lawn he goes on to explain the multi-faceted points of Frank Booth; only one, when he's in Solaris-like territory, does it seem a little cheesy. But Zizek seems to be having a lot of fun with this set-up, and after a while one bypasses the potential crux of this gimmick and Zizek's words come through.<br /><br />There were some films I of course would've expected, chiefly from Hitchcock and Lynch, but a treat for movie buffs come from seeing two things- the movies that one would never think of seeing in a film about films titled the Pervert's Guide of Cinema (top two for me would be the Disney Pluto cartoon and the exposition on Chaplin's films, albeit with a great note about the power and distinction of 'voice'), and the ones that one hasn't seen yet (i.e. the ventriloquist horror film, Dr. Mabuse, Stalker, among a few others) that inspire immediate feelings of 'wow, I have to see that immediately, no questions asked.' Zizek is a powerful writer with his work, and puts it forward with a clarity that reminds one why we watch movies in the first place, to be entertained, sure, but also to have that actual experience of sitting down and having something up there, as he put it, looking into a toilet. It's probably one of the greatest films about cinema, and in such a splendidly narrow analysis of how Freud works its way into films regarding desire, the Id/Super-Ego/Ego, and of the supernatural in fantasy, that you may never see...unless distribution finally kicks in, if only on the smallest levels.",positive

"I wasted 5 dollars renting this complete piece of crap. Dr. Zack is the most unlovable lead character i have ever seen. The movie was full of EVERY cliche you could ever think of and contained not a single OUNCE of originality. There was the typical sexism portrayed by rugged foreigners, all the guys had those 'too-proud to take advice' attitudes that are as stale as grandma's christmas fruitcake. The concept and deaths were really cool, but they lose all novelty once the monster is revealed. (read the SPOILER at the end) Nothing else is really revealed though, the ending is the biggest cop-out you've ever seen. I predicted everything before it happened, including who would die and how. The dialogue is lacking, and that's an understatement by far. There's mostly just random yelling, thoughtful staring, and chunky sentences. The actors are just GOD AWFUL! I don't want to talk about this movie anymore, it's making me angry. I just wonder if the director even watched it when it was done.<br /><br />(SPOILER ALERT!!!! SAVE 5 DOLLARS!) the monster is just a bunch of ants that ""evolved"" so now they need bones so they can move around, (nevermind the fact that this serves no evolutionary advantage whatsoever, and that the ants just killed whoever was available, though the movie acts like they kill out of necessity. This movie made me dumber.) The end consists of the lead idiot killing the mother ant (a big blob thing) which destroys all the other ants. Pretty cliche eh? He almost wusses out at the end because of a sudden emotional attachment to the mother-thing that overcomes him. Give me a break.",negative
"Police officer Michael (Tomas Arana, ""The Church"") has his hands full while investigating a serial killer who's been leaving parts of the bodies of the people that he's been murdering at the house of one recently widowed, Tracy (Joanna Pacula).

All in all, not nearly as good as Bava's earlier ""Macabre"" nor his first two ""Demons"" films, but enjoyable enough if you can forgive the rather outrageous plot twists towards the end of the film.

"Greenaway's films pose as clever, erudite and innovative. Yet his style and grammar originate and remind viewers of films made in the World War 1 era of film-making: the frame composition, use of mid-shot, the static camera. It may be well to rub against mainstream movies with this style but it is not new. Perhaps like that other ""innovator"", TS Eliot, he draws more from the past than in looking forward as an authentic innovator would or could.<br /><br />Yet Greenaway's biggest failing is that he cannot write. His dialog and even plot structure is mechanical and logical but without the vitality of another dramatic logician, Brecht. Where this weakness is most apparent is in his humor, which is poised and logical, so the joke is dead before it's delivered. The result is tedium: if it's not funny, it has failed: ask a stand-up comedian to justify their act if the audience doesn't respond. Perhaps the well-read director could learn something from Freud on humor.<br /><br />Finally, like Woody Allen, Greenaway has manipulated his actors over the years to work like clones. They speak the lines with a bored, smug air like narcissistic adolescents.<br /><br />This film, despite its design and lighting, is meretricious.",negative

"The Good: nThe first 30 minutes: They were intriguing and on the road to do some great world building. The initial dynamic between Law and Larson was very enjoyable.nnBen Mendelson: Absolutely fantastic performance that i thoroughly enjoyed. I was actually not optimistic about it when he was initially cast, but he proved me wrong.  nnA couple of jokes: really landed for me. especially the loading joke.nnDe-aging: The de-aging they did for Jackson and Gregg was no doubt a technological achievement.  nnThe Bad: nnStyle: after Larson returns to earth, the movie loses any stylistic flavoring . even the color grading seems more like a color correction, making the movie have no sense of self. nnSets:  The sets tended to feel hollow and un-lived in. They felt more akin to a high quality network show than a high budget block buster. nnFury: I know that some people will like the direction they took with Fury's character, I on the other hand absolutely hated it. The Fury in this movie and the Fury in the other films has a deep lack of continuity. The origin of the eye patch and how fury deals with it is, ridiculous and played for laughs in a joke that didn't land for me. nnMonica Rambeau: an almost interesting character.  Her ability to be effective as a character is undermined by the writing(i'll explain more)nnRonan: basically Gaurdians Lite. Nothing to see hear. nnLaw: fantastic in the first 30 minutes. grossly underutilized in the rest of the film.nnThe Hero's journey: Will the real captain marvel please stand up? The actual hero's journey in this movie takes place within 30 seconds of flashback where Danvers is shown symbolically standing up against the patriarchy after failing many times, ending in (spoilers***) her removing the literal control/suppression patch on the back of her neck, ridding herself from the oppression of toxic masculinity. nnFeminism: The feminism in this movie was petulant and uninspiring. In movies like black panther and wonder woman, the women actually are strong and feminine, they are confident and powerful. The writing in this movie undermines the power of the characters. actually strong woman don't have to say ""don't call my flying nifty again"" or ""don't call me young lady again"". This came across as petulant and childish and not ""strong"", a total missing of the mark IMO. The feminism in this movie also treats men as caricatured strawmen of everything that toxic feminists hate, therefore making this film feel intellectually void. nnCGI: The final battle CGI was terrible and distracting.nnLarson: Unfortunately i still think Larson was miscast. I think she will be more suited to play Marvel in the upcoming endgame under the direction of the Russo Brothers. I don't think her not working in the movie was Larson's fault. She is absolutely a talented actress, however she is best utilized when she stays in her lane. nnConclusion: This movie should have been a character drama about identity, trust and betrayal, in which Larson would have absolutely thrived. It almost was but most was thrown out in favor of 90's nostalgia, bad writing, and clumsy modern political ideology.",controversial

"""Oh, you pilots are such men."" ""They don't call it the cockpit for nothing, honey."" Dialogue like that is just one of many reasons why The Concorde Airport '79 (or, if you saw it in the UK where it dragged its heels getting released there, Airport '80: The Concorde) was the last and by far the least of the series. The disaster movie was in dire straits in the late70s, what with The Swarm having offered much unintentional hilarity and Beyond the Poseidon Adventure, When Time Ran Out and City on Fire simply offering much boredom, and the desperation to find a new spin on the genre is all too apparent here. This time it's a conspiracy plot, with Susan Blakely's news anchorwoman discovering billionaire boyfriend Robert Wagner has been selling arms to terrorists and the North Vietnamese. Naturally, she decides to tell him everything rather than make the story public, but, he fobs her off by explaining ""I'm a very rich man. I have everything in life I could ever want. Why would I jeopardise that by doing something so incredibly stupid?"" Just in case she doesn't buy that line, rather than, say hire a hit-man to kill her on the ground, he decides to do things the smart way by planning to destroy the Concorde while she's flying to Moscow via Paris. ""I've done a lot of things I've been ashamed of, but I am not a murderer,"" he insists indignantly on his way to reprogramme a guided missile to destroy the plane. So, nothing incredibly stupid there. And when that fails, he sends a jet fighter after it. And when that fails <br /><br />Don't even think of looking for anything resembling logic here: this is real bottom-of-the-barrel stuff that even the studio gave up on and marketed as a comedy in the US after critics laughed it off the screen. Where the previous three entries all had the look of glossy big-budget entertainments, this small-screen friendly effort (the only one not to be shot in 2.35:1 widescreen) doesn't even manage to make the Concorde look good, which is quite a feat. TV veteran David Lowell Rich presumably got the directing gig because he was fast, cheap and had previously directed TV movie SST: Disaster in the Sky where Peter Graves' supersonic airplane found itself unable to land due to sabotage and Senegalese flu (which was not, intentionally at least, a comedy despite the presence of a young Billy Crystal in the cast) and seemed like the natural choice for what looks like a $14m TV movie that somehow escaped into theatres when no-one was looking.<br /><br />Cast like a bad episode of Hollywood Squares, stars are in very short supply this time round, and most of the few vaguely familiar faces seem to have been rounded up from rehab clinics and busted sitcoms. Alain Delon gives the Hollywood career that one last shot as the pilot, ""Happy Fish"" (don't ask) George Kennedy moves from the executive suite to the co-pilot's seat in the hope of reminding people of the other movies, while the rest of the ensemble includes a couple of veterans of The Towering Inferno (Wagner and Blakely), a soft-porn star (Sylvia Kristel, trying to go respectable), an Ingmar Bergman regular (Bibi Andersson  and she's the one playing the hooker!), David Warner's navigator on a diet having nightmares about being chased by bananas, the voice of the Devil (Mercedes McCambridge), Charo and her Seeing Eye Chihuahua (""Dohn miscon-screw me""), Martha Raye and her weak bladder, Jimmie Walker playing the sax in his seat and smoking weed in the john (in the few moments its not occupied by Martha Raye), Cicely Tyson kissing her credibility goodbye as the obligatory mother with critically ill child and a frozen heart in the overhead locker, airline owner Eddie Albert and trophy wife Sybil Danning occupying the best seat in the house, Ed Begley Jr in goggles, and the Russian Olympic team and their lovable coach Val Avery and his deaf daughter (ahhhh!) on a goodwill tour of the States (who knew about the boycott?). Just to add a touch of The Simpsons to proceedings, Harry Shearer voices one news report in the same tones he'd later use for Smithers.<br /><br />Highlight? Despite the impromptu wedding ceremony during a crash landing, it just has to be George Kennedy diverting a heat-seeking missile by opening the window, sticking his arm out (at nearly twice the speed of sound!) and firing a flare  while the plane is upside down! And then Alain Delon turns off the engines so there won't be a ""heat source"" for the missiles to home in on Yes, someone actually got paid for writing this, and that someone was future Oscar winner and screenwriter of Munich and The Insider Eric Roth (hey, everybody has to start somewhere), although in his defence it was producer Jennings Lang who came up with the plot. Still, what do you expect from a film that credits stunt balloonists and ends with a shot of the Concorde flying off into the sunset? Amazingly, in one of those won't admit defeat moments studios used to be prone to, Universal shot another 20 minutes or so of footage a couple of years later to include in the network TV showings (not included on the DVD). Sadly its box-office failure led to the fifth entry in the series, the laugh-riot that would have been Airport 1984: UFO, never getting off the ground. Even more genuinely tragically, it was the Concorde used in this film that crashed in France 21 years later.<br /><br />(Oh, and if you're wondering what Charo says to her Chihuahua in unsubtitled Spanish when it's not allowed on board, it's ""What do you think? Don't worry. When the revolution comes, I promise you will fly on anything you want. I promise. What a shame, my love. What do they think they are?"")",negative

"It wasn't amazing, but it wasn't as bad as people are saying it is. I wasn't initially going to write this, but after I saw the movie and looked at its rating, I felt I should. I walked out feeling satisfied with the movie and happy with what I saw. I really only have a few complaints. Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel falls short in this movie. She was just too bland. She seemed too plain and cookie-cutter and didn't have any moments that would define her as a character. I don't think this is Brie Larson's fault, for she has proven that she is a talented and and respected actress, instead I think the writing just didn't hit the mark on Carol. My only other major complaint would be that the first 20 minutes or so is not so great, although it does improve. But that's really it. Maybe you could bring up a thing here or there, such as, the CGI wasn't very good sometimes, but there really wasn't anything glaringly bad about it. The ply moves smoothly and makes sense, the other characters have personalities and contribute to the story, and it's fun to watch. I would also like to bring up the fact that everyone keeps talking about the â€śpandering to the SJWsâ€ť and the â€śleftest viewsâ€ť that are really dragging this movie down. The movie really doesn't do that. Going in, I was actually weary about them shoving it doe in my throat, but it doesn't. It may have some small references here and there, but overall, I think the message was good and it wasn't overemphasized. To sum it up, it's worth your time. Don't listen to the crap that it's getting from everyone. And again, it's not incredible, but it's definitely not worthy of the hate it is getting right now.

"There's something compelling and strangely believable about this episode. From the very beginning, an atmosphere of tension is created by the knowledge that a certain planet is going to explode within a few hours. Kirk, Spock and McCoy have beamed down to evacuate the inhabitants, all of whom seem to have left already for parts unknown, except for an elderly librarian.<br /><br />The librarian's polite but cryptic advice about where all the citizens have gone to is interrupted by a crisis in which all three Enterprise crew members find themselves unexpectedly hurled into different eras of the planet's past. Kirk finds himself in a time period resembling 17th Century England, while Spock and McCoy are stranded in a desolate, frozen waste. <br /><br />The intercutting between the two stories, and the different hazardous situations the men find themselves in is superbly handled, with return to the present an unknown chance, while the minutes are counting down to the planet's explosion. <br /><br />Imaginative writing and fine acting characterize this episode, with a touching performance by Mariette Hartley as a woman exiled to the Ice Age, and Ian Wolfe as the urbane Librarian.

Sadly, the resulting film - which the ads claimed was 'nine times more suspenseful' than ""Bird"" - is a disappointing follow-up, impeccably photographed and stylishly executed, but too plodding and aimless for general consumption.<br /><br />Malden and Franciscus are eminently watchable in sympathetic roles, and cinematographer Enrico Menczer (THE DEAD ARE ALIVE) uses the wide Cromoscope frame to convey the hi-tech world in which Argento's dark-hearted scenario unfolds, but the subplot involving Euro starlet Catherine Spaak (THE LIBERTINE) as Franciscus' romantic interest amounts to little more than unnecessary padding. Highlights include an unforgettable encounter with the black-gloved assassin in a crowded railway station (edited with sleek assurance by cult movie stalwart Franco Fraticelli), and a nocturnal episode in which Malden and Franciscus seek an important clue inside a mouldering tomb and fall prey to the killer's devious machinations. But despite these flashes of brilliance, the film rambles aimlessly from one scene to the next, simmering gently without ever really coming to the boil.

The 1997 version is a 20 minute movie 'crammed' into 2 hours or whatever the runtime is. Cheesy storyline, which by the way, is completely different than the original. The major government involvement was far-fetched. There is no flow from one scene to the next. In the original you could go get a beer or hit the bathroom and still keep up. <br /><br />It only took a few hours movie time to change the oil pan on the car.

"Solid B+nnTypical MCU origin movie. A couple of surprises, but nothing Earth-shattering. nFirst 30 minutes are a bit clunky, but once the action settles on Earth, it smooths out. The buddy-cop vibe between Fury and Danvers was fun. Ben Mendelsohn really steals the show, especially when he shows up at Maria Rambeau's house and keeps his native Aussie accent (there's a great nod to Pulp Fiction here too). He's as good here as Alan Rickman.nnThe No Doubt song used in the 3rd act was a little obvious and ham-fisted. Alanis Morissette's excellent break-up anthem 'You Oughta Know' might have fit better here both thematically and tonally while not being over the top. nInteresting take on the Skrulls that deviated on the source material. However given the current political climate, I can totally understand the unintended messaging consequences that would have resulted from keeping them closer to the source material. And it's not inconsistent with how they've been portrayed, so it works. Another change from their Ă˘originĂ˘? was likely due to a certain character's rights at the time of production. It's kinda sad that we didn't get a tease of a certain potential Phase 4 Big Bad, especially now that those character's rights are about to revert back to Marvel. nnThere's been criticism that Danvers is too wooden and lacking personality here, but that's understandable given the situation she's in what with her having amnesia. We saw a few hints of her human past, but seeing more of her from her pre-Kree days would have greatly helped make for a much richer character. So much of Steve Rogers' motivation & character comes from his desire to serve in WW2 and to continue to do so after his thawing out (Ă˘I don't like bullies.Ă˘?) But why did Carol Danvers join the Air Force, especially at a time when we weren't at war and when women were restricted from flying in combat? The trailers suggested that a lot of time will be devoted to this part of Danvers' backstory, but in the final edit, this part of her character is glossed over. It's merely a plot point to put Danvers in the right place at the right time (It reminded me of Hal Jordan in Green Lantern). Even James Rhodes (Ă˘~War Machine'), a supporting character in the MCU who is also USAF, with a few lines of dialog in 'Civil War' we got a complete understanding of his motivations. We like Cao because we got to know and like Steve Roger *before* he got his abilities. Carol Danvers deserved as much. As we enter Phase 4 and Carol Danvers is being positioned to pick up the mantle of one of the leaders of the MCU moving forward, she deserves a little better than what she got here. So yeah, the script could have probably used one more pass and we could have spent more time with Capt. Captain Danvers, USAF. Fingers crossed that Endgame will do her justice.nnOverall, I enjoyed Captain Marvel. I'm glad she wasn't shoehorned into the end of Age of Ultron like Whedon wanted and after the end-credits preview, I'm looking forward to seeing how she plays into Endgame and beyond.",negative

"I totally got drawn into this and couldn't wait for each episode. The acting brought to life how emotional a missing person in the family must be , together with the effects it would have on those closest. The only problem we as a family had was how quickly it was all 'explained' at the end. We couldn't hear clearly what was said and have no idea what Gary's part in the whole thing was? Why did Kyle phone him and why did he go along with it? Having invested in a series for five hours we felt cheated that only five minutes was kept back for the conclusion. I have asked around and none of my friends who watched it were any the wiser either. Very strange but maybe we missed something crucial ????",positive

The big action payoff of the last act feels well earned, and while Captain Marvel the character has extraordinary powers, the majority of the film is very grounded and relatable. I loved seeing younger Fury and Coulson, and Samuel L. does a great job of bringing a youthful excitement and naĂŻvetĂ© to the character to predate the more hardened Fury we know from later in the timeline.

"This didn't even feel like a superhero movie let alone an addition to the legendary MCU. The characters were unbelievable as human beings save for Samuel L. Jackson and the cat was honestly the best character in the whole movie. The sheer stupidity of reconning the Avengers name to be after her call sign was a spit in the face to all of the previous titles that played a part in forming the MCU. I honestly feel like a chimpanzee slapping a keyboard would have produced a more competent script; and Brie Larson made planks of wood appear more emotional with her bland and frankly bored delivery of the already unpopular carol danvers character. I wanted to come out of this and say I was wrong in all my doubts from the trailers, turned out to be even more disappointing than I would have ever guessed",negative

"Vidor shines as Judith, the only truly strong and compassionate member of a strictly patriarchal family.

This is not an out-of-wedlock pregnancy, which would have been horrific by 1921 standards. The two are secretly married, but Nan's father, having been paid by David's father, tears up their marriage certificate.<br /><br />Nan's death scene, with Judith in attendance, is a truly heart-rending experience, and highly charged with emotion. This scene alone is worth watching the movie for, but there's far more to the plot than that; why on earth aren't modern movies made with the same attention to the story?",positive
A complete disaster for Marvel. A bored plain movie that pretended much more than its real possibilities. Danvers is not good as CM . A movie without a real villain.

Not to mention, that for a long time it was just depressing about the same thing over and over again. So, sorry, Tyler Perry, but try harder next time.

"Movie was okay.  The supporting characters were interesting and fun to watch.  The flow of the movie, such that the plot moved forward while slipping in quick flashbacks to slowly explain the amnesia, was cleverly done.  The main character, on the other hand, was not particularly interesting.  I didn't particularly like her, nor did I dislike her.  Indifference to the story of the main character made me feel meh at the end.  Would have loved to see a movie focused on her test-pilot friend.  Part of the lack of engagement in the character is that I had no idea who she was and she appeared to has no weaknesses.  She was courageous in the past.  She was courageous in the movie.  She faced no real threat during the entire film.  The reveal of the plot at the end was also disappointingly predictable.  The final confrontation(s) was(were) without tension.  Overall I'm glad I know the character because I am interested in how the next MCU movie will go but that interest has ebbed somewhat because her character has no flaws or weaknesses.  She can 'snap' her fingers to fight anyone.",negative

The supporting cast all do excellent jobs - particularly Anette Benning and Jude Law's pretty good too. The action's engaging and the special effects looked pretty great (noticeably better than the trailers). nnThe highlight for me as a Marvel comics fan was getting to see the Kree and the Skrulls. The Kree civilization in particular is showcased here and we get to see more of it than we have in previous Marvel movies so that was a treat.nnThere are better Marvel movies than this and its another origin story when said and done. Still, its entertaining, exciting and fun just as we've come to expect from the MCU. Its really not something that such a fuss should've been kicked up about by internet warriors. Whatever message about female empowerment is here is very general and hardly exceptionable or particularly intrusive. It takes a back seat to the superheroics. Not the greatest thing ever but definitely a good movie and another plus in the greatest winning streak in cinema history. ",positive

A week or so in the life of an LA band that does a crappy magic show, at a level that you'd maybe see in one of the lesser casinos off the Strip, and an Aussie stuntman new in town finding his feet... They work, they meet girls, they party. End of story.<br /><br />The band obviously needed all that stuff because they are frankly second-tier, and playing a style that was already dated in 1978. It has to be said that the stunt bits in the film are genuinely spinetingling - that Aussie fellow really is something, and the film seems largely motivated by love and respect for the ""art"".

"China O'Brien (1990) was an attempt to make Cynthia Rothrock a star in the United States. This Golden Harvet production was helmed by veteran director Robert Clouse. Sadly he was either lucky with Enter the Dragon or he's lost his touch because he's not that great of a director. The only reason to watch this movie is to see the fighting skills of Ms. Rothrock and Richard Norton.

The story focuses on a vigilante group called The Librarians led by Agent Simon (WIlliam Forsythe). The group is hot in pursuit of a nefarious, multi-lingual, pockmarked creature named Marcos (Andrew Divoff) who captures women and holds them hostage in the lawless urban world of south Florida. <br /><br />Burt Reynolds appears as a cameo in this film, and his scene is entirely extraneous to the action. Burt delivers a long monologue in one of the strangest drawls I have ever heard.

The dogged determination of Stephen Rea's character, Burakov, is simply captivating. With any due apologies to him, his hangdog, continually put-upon expression serves the character well. He is, as we in England would say of the Inspector Taggart TV series character, bound to be grim because he sees three murders a week. Well, that's not strictly accurate as Chikatila operated over a number of years...<br /><br />You get a real sense of the blankwall resistance of the USSR bureaucracy, brilliantly portrayed by Joss Ackland (who often seems made for this sort of role).<br /><br />A key character (and I write this as the remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers is being shown on BBC1) is the Donald Sutherland character ""Mikhail Fetisov"". His quiet support of Burakov is steadfast. And it endures through Perestroika, and drives the involvement of the FBI for profiling. Brilliant.<br /><br />This is a must-see, as far as I am concerned.",positive

The music was really good - the story was focused and self contained, and about the Carol Danvers  development into Captain Marvel (although whats weird is she never actually go called Captain Marvel in the movie).

"Captain Marvel desperately wants to be about female empowerment and how a woman finally breaks free from the men holding her back by telling her she's not strong enough, doesn't belong or can't control her emotions. And while the movie goes about this in the most juvenile way possible, it doesn't successfully convey this concept at all. Intentions aside, due to poor writing and ineffective directing, what we see on screen is a character who, before serendipitously gaining powers from the Tesseract, is literally nothing and no one. Seriously. There is virtually no development of her character before the crash. The movie fails to make us feel for Carol Danvers the person, in favor of whiz-pow action and feminine grandstanding. Outside of her friendship with Maria Rambeau, she doesn't even seem to exhibit any curiosity about her former life. Maybe she had a controlling father, but still, is there no one in her family she longs to see or reassure that's she's still alive? So much could've been done to make Carol Danvers a hero-in-waiting destined for greatness instead of someone who's story only begins after stumbling onto extraordinary powers by chance. It's a missed opportunity for a supposed groundbreaking film.",negative

"""Subconscious Cruelty"" has to be one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen.Still it's extremely grim and gory at times,so fans of politically correct mainstream horror garbage shouldn't bother.The film mixes many wonderful visuals with plenty of sleaze and gore.It is extremely odd,vicious and disturbing,so fans of bizarre cinema won't be disappointed. My favourite segment from ""Subconscious Cruelty"" is ""Human Larvae"" which shows us a twisted relationship between a young man and his pregnant sister.The birthing scene is particularly nasty and not easily forgotten.The last segment ""Right Brain/Martyrdom"" has to be seen to be believed.It's incredibly harsh and blasphemous with scenes of genital mutilation and grisly torture.We see Jesus Christ captured by three naked females who mutilate him,ripping flesh from his chest,licking a wound on his knee and pissing on him.There is also a Jesus statue with a projection of a swastika on it.""Subconscious Cruelty"" is a truly memorable film that should be seen by fans of extreme cinema.Check it out.",positive

"I have read almost all the books by now, and have seen the musical production in two different languages. I absolutely adored everything that I have been acquainted previously. But lately I've been running out of resources to sustain my fancy. I still have couple of books left, but they are either in transit or they are the sequels which I am not in a hurry to read. So an idea dawned on me - Sink me! There are movies which I have not watched! Thus, I must watch them immediately.<br /><br />The first five minutes of these series were... acceptable. In fact, I quite enjoyed the variation of the reason for the denunciation, however different it had seemed. It went all downhill from there, though. Chauvelin was too... foppish? And, I daresay, too old for this role. Not nearly that dark and dashing figure with his dreadful either-or. (And what was that with random bed scene featuring him? It was way too creepy - wasn't his only love the Madame Guillotine, and his only interest - his job, and his only obsession - Sir Percy?) Marguerite... Prettiest woman in France? Cleverest woman in Europe? I think not. Although, whatever compelled her to break into the study of Sir Percy I haven't the faintest idea. And whatever my Lord Tony has done to deserve this death? Yes, every member of the League did pledge his life to Sir Percy, but he would have never endangered any of them nor would have run away like a coward when his dear friend faces mortal danger. And if by any means he had to mourn his companion, he would have done that, mourn, not just move on as if nothing had happened. Which brings me to another point, Sir Percy. His portrayal was most dreadful. He was neither a lazy fop, nor a gallant and elusive hero who is a master of transformations. Nor did he care too much about cravats (his pronunciation of that word alone made my ears bleed) And with his own hands he had never killed anyone. So what was that with him randomly walking around and slaughtering people?<br /><br />The costumes were just too flashy for that time period as well. This is post-revolutionary France we are talking about! Not pre-revolutionary. People in dresses like that stand out in a crowd quite easily. It was all just... gah!<br /><br />Although, I must admit, after I watched other parts my opinion did change slightly. Watching it as a separate work, independent of Scarlet Pimpernel series, it was tolerable. Just your other average hero in the mask. But for what they tried to pass it, it is still miserable.",negative

"Timeline issues aside, the movie had slow pacing until the third act and the acting by everyone other than Samuel L.

CGI and third act of the movie were great, but borrowed to many elements from Star Wars, especially the soundtrack of the 3rd act, so it felt like a different better movie.

"Brie Larson is the worst part of an overall good movie. She is constantly told to keep her emotions in check, while displaying no emotion. Her delivery is as flat as North Dakota. Captain Marvel works well as a solo movie but becomes problematic in the overall MCU. It makes no sense why she has not been in other Marvel movies (especially Guardians of the Galaxy). Marvel should have introduced her in Phase 2 at latest, or simply waited until Phase 4. Also, the movie will remind what decade it is every ten minutes.",positive

"...that maybe someday people will wake up to. People who can resist the urge to separate each and everything, and who see the 60s for what they were. People who can see that it was the individuals who made those times; not the other way around.<br /><br />The ""Forrest Gump"" comparison is a good one. Both films look at the 60s, but ""Four Friends"" is about human beings, as opposed to caricatures. FF delves deeply into the very thing that FG (quite successfully!) tries to condense and classify as nothing more than a backdrop. But while ""Gump"" files the 60s away in an attic like old toys in a box, ""Four Friends"" picks up and embraces each toy, thus blurring the lines between what you hold dearly and what you are.<br /><br />If you associate romance with shoe polish, you'll hate this film.",positive

I say suspicious because it looks less like a review but more like a publicity statement. Perhaps the filmmaker himself, or one of his mates, has written that ""review""? Naughty, naughty.<br /><br />I watched this movie on the Propeller channel on Sky TV expecting it to be truly awful. The special effects used were to be honest very, very good for a low budget film, and some of the acting wasn't that bad either, but most of the acting was really awful, but well done for trying, as I expect most were pals of the filmmaker.<br /><br />I think the filmmaker has done really well by trying to punch above his weight. I did find some of the film funny because it was trying to be super cool when it just wasn't.<br /><br />If you don't take this film too seriously and watch it whilst drunk with some mates you might well have a good time but probably not in the way it was intended. This film is no way a 9/10 but worth watching for a laugh bearing in mind it was made on a very very low budget and in fairness due credit to those involved in it's production.",negative

"] Haven't seen this film? Haven't even heard of this film? It wouldn't surprise me. One of the few truly ""independent"" films produced in the last ten years, no studio had faith in the picture and it was never picked up for major distribution. The independent company Kino Films, gave BOESMAN AND LENA a very limited run with virtually no promotion, and the majority of major film critics didn't even bother reviewing it. I guess a movie based on a one act, one set play about the apartheid and its affect on two individuals never really had a chance in today's market - and it's the intelligent film-lover's loss.<br /><br />For the record, both Angela Bassett and Danny Glover deserved Ocsar nominations (as did the cinematographer) but the film received such little fanfare that I can't even blame the academy on that one. This is a film that is challenging, thought-provoking, and heartbreaking, and it actually requires the audience to meet it on it's own terms. Taking that into consideration, it is definitely not a movie for mindless entertainment. Director John Berry wisely does not attempt to dress-up Athol Fugard's play. Sure, we're given a few fractured flashbacks and some breathtaking scenic shots, but the film version of BOESMAN AND LENA remains, on the whole, a story of two people living in inhumane conditions.<br /><br />Stripped of their basic human rights, Boesman (Glover) and Lena (Bassett) have no one left to attack but each other. A third character joins them for awhile (Willie Jonah, amazing in a largely silent role), but the film's focus never strays from the title characters and what they've become. Bassett and Glover give brave performances as the broken couple, performances that simply could not be improved upon. Vigorously and brutally stimulating, both intellectually and emotionally, BOESMAN AND LENA deserves to be rediscovered of home video. Hands down, the best film of the year 2000.",positive

And how Eva Röse after the making of this film can be seen at breakfast-TV promoting it just disappoints me.<br /><br />This film doesn't contain a story, the script is illogical, stiff and last but not least, just plain bad. These two young directors have put together a quite disgusting boy-fantasy containing violence, comic-strips and trivialized psychological portraits.

Sam Jackson was useless, there for just one liners and to be a damsal in distress. the movie works best when it's trying to be a buddy cop movie in my opinion but it tries too hard to cram all these different subplots in there that it feels like 3 different movies in one.

"Stanley Kubrick, a director who I hold in the highest of esteems for his masterpieces (Clockwork Orange, 2001, The Killing, the Shining, Dr. Strangelove, etc) took the film out of circulation, leaving it to be found by only the hardcore fans and completists. After seeing the film for myself, I could see why. At the age of 24, Kubrick had already honed his craft of still photography for LOOK magazine, and had done a few short documentaries. Like many first-time filmmakers that came in the decades after him, his ambition for Fear and Desire was, in short, to just go and make a film, cheaply, more than likely to see if he could do it. On that level, he was successful. However, the film itself definitely is not.<br /><br />I can't really say that the film is a failure because there was something I did like about it throughout. Even as the film's story went on the wayside, and the actors (whom Kubrick didn't have any idea how to direct, not being a man of the theater), his knack for producing and capturing some great images gets its seeds in this film. At times, there are some shots of close-ups and quick-shots in suspense/action scenes that are eye-catching. Unfortunately, this is all the good I can really say of the film. Although there are a couple of 'name' actors in the film (Frank Slivera, who also appeared in Killer's Kiss, and Paul Mazursky, a director in his own right), the performances overall are dull and very routine.<br /><br />In fact, that is the film's main demise for me; whenever I watch any Kubrick film, even his early film noirs Killer's Kiss and the Killing, I can tell who made it, as his style by then became distinct, which would continue as he evolved as an artist. It wasn't 'artsy' like I might have pictured (which is usually the case with first-time directors like Scorsese and Spielberg), but watching this film not only did it feel like it wasn't Kubrick, it felt like a lot of the time I was watching some B (or even C) grade movie by a director that time forgot- not quite 'Ed Wood' bad, but close. The music is as standard as can be, the fades are pedestrian, and the plot seems to not really hold that much attention.<br /><br />In short, as others have said and which I can agree, this is a ""doodle pad"" of a future ground-breaker, who shows some shots and a few edits that grab some attention (the best scene overall being when the soldiers take the dumb girl hostage), but not enough to really recommend except to those, like myself, who end up seeing everything by Kubrick (or, perhaps, have to see every ultra-low budget war film ever made), if only out of curiosity.",negative

"First, let me confess that I have not read this particular Balzac novel, so maybe I am directing my cavils unfairly at director and editor. Still my experience with Balzac in other stories is that he writes as a realist, not an obscurantist. This is most certainly a film worth one's while, but one is left sorely puzzled at the end. Was the Colonel a fraud, used by the lawyer for his own ends (or for whose beyond himself); or was the Colonel not a fraud, but used as aforesaid by the lawyer; or did the lawyer truly try to serve the honest Colonel? The director and/or the editor appear to me to have deliberately obscured these questions, which doesn't seem like Balzac, the realist. At the same time the film does an excellent job of delineating the characters, if not their motives, and the cast and production is superb. That opening battlefield scene is bound to haunt one's dreams. Still, one wonders at the all too common penchant among contemporary film makers to favor ambiguity above all else.

"I made a big mistake going to see this film. That's the lottery of going to see films I guess. After five minutes you just knew it was going to be a clunker, and I fought quite hard to stay in my seat - the old ""lose two hours of your life"" kind of feeling.<br /><br />The fundamental problem is that, without even mentioning the whole ""historical accuracy"" thread of reviews, the script is achingly, painful, bad.<br /><br />The first thirty minutes could have been spread out to an hour to give a plausible, real, plot development. Instead, it lurched from from one undramatic ""dramatic"" event to the next. Having the girl cry at the start of the film makes no sense because the audience has no emotional attachment to anything at this point. And that whole walking off into the sunset through the long-grass field at the end, what the hell was that about? <br /><br />Not even the excellent Ed Harris could save this one. You could almost feel his pain at some of the lines he had to utter. The most fabulously awful one was, for no apparent reason, he stares at the girl as she copies his work in his apartment, she looks up, it all goes a bit fuzzy romantic kind-a lighting (or am I dreaming), and he says, with authority in his voice, <br /><br />""WASH ME."" <br /><br />And she gets up and washes him, with a sponge. ""Wash me"" WTF? That's hilarious.<br /><br />And then there was the music. The long extended session when it was just Beethoven conducting and the 9th Symphony pouring out of the surround sound in the cinema and the choir waiting, waiting, standing there silently for what seems like forever. And then, finally, launching into enormous sound. It was spine-chillingly wonderful and dare I say it, it brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />So that is where the film picked up two stars. The only part of the film where Beethoven got to say exactly what he wanted to say.<br /><br />And I believed him.",negative
Captain Marvel was a very unlikable character. She had no believable emotion and was generally rude and snarky throughout the film. Many of her lines and jokes simply did not land and it was hard for me to get on board with this character. This is NOT because she is a woman. I absolutely love all the other female heroes within the Marvel Cinematic Universe but this character was very clearly an empty shell meant to force a feminist agenda. Just make a female character that is interesting and both male and female audience members will be on board. Please fix this character for the sake of the future of the MCU.,controversial
"Been reading the comic book for years, went back and read the original run from the 70's. nnSome points I want to recognize:nThe character had her memory wiped multiple times in the books and each time Carol was on a journey of self discovery often times sprinkled with pain of loss. Kelly Deconics run being no different for which a large part of the movie was based on. nnEach and every time, initially Carol was kinda flat an empty shell of rage. No she didn't smile much either. XD that was the point though as she regained what she lost, as her knowledge of ""self"" return I watched as Carol blossomed into a full gambit of emotions and fullness of character. nnIn the movie the Kree are trying to suppress exactly who she is. A hot head, strong willed, a tad impatient and prefers to punch her way out of situations. Who else does this oversimplified version of the character sound like? Tony Stark. Without the drinking and the quips its a fair comparison. Who else though? Captain America. I can hear the groans now but I'm comparing their stubbornness only really and maybe the punching.  nnSo if Carol is a psedo copy of Stark at least emotionally what's the problem? Brie Larson is a Feminist and female. Comics have been a boys club a long time. Don't let those opininated women in here to wreck our fun ECT. There's a singular problem that has been convientently forgotten. Carol Danvers is a Feminist to. The character is a Feminist. Under Jay Jonah Jameson she was the chief editor of Woman Magazine. It's interesting for me to watch the fight in the books come to life in the real world with the same backward arguments. She won in the books, and I think she will win at the box office as well. Keep being you Brie Larson, you are the true embodiment of Carol.",controversial
"If Captain Marvel is the future of the MCU, the light has burned out.  There is still hope for Avengers End Game if Captain Marvel does not mess that up as well.  Sorry, but this ranks as the weakest entry of the MCU, yes even lower than Hulk.  This fall into some of the X-Men range of quality. (Wolverine, I am looking at you)  The story is forced, not natural.  There is no connection to the Hero as in prior movies.  You cannot feel anything for the Marvel, as she is rather bland and disconnected.  Unfortunately the movie is just like the comics that spawn this movie.  I was hoping for better, really I was, but came away with the meh feeling.  I could have spent my money elsewhere and been much happier.

This was a very average super hero movie. The story was bland and Brie Larson looked like she was mailing it in. It was worth the watch but that was all. It wasn't funny enough to call it a comedy. It wasn't action packed enough to call it an action movie. It wasn't dramatic enough to call it a drama. If they were only trying to introduce the character they did just that. The last 12 Marvel movies were all better than Captain Marvel. Overall it was a good movie but not at all great. 7 out of -.,negative
"High quality production and support cast, but main character falls flat in terms of believability or character development. All of the problems of a superman character, causing her to be really boring and someone the watcher doesn't resonate to. This movie was supposed to be showing a strong female character fighting against misogyny, but her strength isn't earned and her struggles are forced. Too many stories trying to be juggled at the same time. Worst of all, subsequent watches of other movies in the franchise no longer hold up from a timeline perspective due to careless mistakes, some intentional for a cheap laugh. Arguably the worst MCU movie. Watch it for some great acting from Samuel L Jackson and Akira Ackbar, and some impressive de-aging.",negative

"THE SECRET OF KELLS may be the most exquisite film I have seen since THE TRIPLETS OF BELLEVILLE. Although stylistically very different, KELLS shares with TRIPLETS and (the jaw-dropping opening 2D sequence of) KUNG FU PANDA, incredible art direction, production design, background/layout and a richness in color that is a feast for one's senses. KELLS is so lavish -- almost Gothic in its layout (somewhat reminiscent of Klimt), wonderfully flat in general overall perspective, ornate in its Celtic & illuminated design, yet the characters are so simplistic and appealing -- AND it all works together beautifully. You fall in love with the characters from the moment you meet them. You are so drawn to every detail of the story and to every stroke of the pencil & brush. What Tomm, Nora, Ross, Paul and all at Cartoon Saloon (& their extended crews) have achieved with this small budget/VERY small crewed film, is absolutely astounding. The groundswell of support amongst our animation community is phenomenal. This film is breathtaking and the buzz amongst our colleagues in recommending this film is spreading like wildfire. Congratulations to KELLS on its many accolades, its Annie nomination as well as its current Oscar qualifying run. They are all very well-deserved nods, indeed...",positive
"I was disappointed by Captain Marvel. The trailers were great but the best parts of the movie were used in the trailer. They didn't save any cool action scenes or fight moves for the actual movie. When I first saw her flaming mohawk I expected it was going to be entertaining and weird like Guardians of the Galaxy. But like I said before, they really didn't save anyone exciting for the actual movie. Another bone I have to pick is, I really didn't like the cat. The choice to have the cat scratch out Fury's eye after they built it up to be a major betrayal in Winter Soldier was a major let down. Not as bad as the Mandarin in Iron Man 3 but pretty close. Plus the tesseract stuff felt forced and didn't really make sense in the continuity of the MCU. The biggest let down was Captain Marvel's character arc. It's basically she has amnesia. That is not an interesting choice. Brie Larson is an Oscar winning actress and all they gave her was she doesn't remember she's human. What a waste. Plus they revealed her human background in the trailers so that wasn't a revelation. This movie really suffered from too much given away in the trailers. And Marvel should know that we fans watch the trailers religiously and multiple times in preparation of the movie coming out. So please save the best stuff for the theater next time. So... what did I like? Not much other than the Skrulls reveal. I liked that they were a complex race and not just eeeevil. I do hope they can still be bad guys for a future Fantastic Four movie but it was a smsrt choice to give them depth for this movie. Other than that it was hard to enjoy the film. Marvel has been making so many tremendous and surprisingly great movies in a row that you expect that quality every time. So to see them drop the ball on the most powerful character in the MCU was shocking. They've screwed up before like Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2 & 3, Thor and righted the ship. Fingers crossed they figure out Captain Marvel for her sequel.",positive

"The 1983 BBC production of ""Jane Eyre"" starring Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton (LOVE HIM) has always been and will always be my favorite Jane Eyre. If you watch any other version of Jane Eyre without reading the book, it will be like watching some regular movie which you will forget the next day. But watching this one almost equals to reading the book. I used to watch these miniseries a lot when I was little, and they inspired me to read the book. At the time I didn't pay attention to how close this television production was to the book. Recently, I watched the 1996 version of Jane Eyre and was very disappointed. It was only 2 hours long and didn't have many important scenes from the book (such as my favorite gypsy scene). After that I fell in love with This ""Jane Eyre"" even more because it includes all the important scenes of the book and it just tells the whole story( the other versions don't, if you haven't read the book). <br /><br />The cast of 1983 Jane Eyre is excellent. It's true that Timothy Dalton is a very handsome actor (handsome enough to play Butler in ""Scarlet"", and Julius Caesar), but he is so great as Rochester that I can't imagine anybody else playing this role. And Zelah Clarke is, without a doubt, the only Jane that follows the description of the book. The other thing that makes this film so great is the clothes and the makeup of the actors. Jane looks so modest and naive, just as Bronte describes her (although she doesn't look 18, but do you actually pay attention to that?...) <br /><br />Some people say that this ""Jane Eyre"" is too long, but I would rather spend my whole day watching it than spend 2 hours watching some other version. Some say the movie is dull and boring because Jane is not passionate enough, or because there are not enough ""kissing scenes"". I hate when they make Jane Eyre some ""Hollywood movie"" with inappropriate kissing scenes. You don't have to include ""crazy, madly in love"" scenes to show the love between Jane and Rochester. And both Zelah and Timothy express this love so perfectly that there are no other scenes needed!! I am 19 years old, and many girls of my age refer to this film as ""boring and old-fashioned"". But I can only feel sorry for them because they don't appreciate the purity and beauty of it. After all, the novel is set in 19th century, and that old-fashioned look makes it more attractive and more like the book. <br /><br />I don't think there will ever be any other version of Jane Ayre that will have the popularity and love of this one. No matter who plays Jane and Rochester in other movies, the real Jane and Rochester (for me at least) will always be Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton!",positive

"This movie blew me away - I have only seen two episodes of the show, never saw the first movie, but went to a pre-screening where Johnny Knoxville himself introduced the movie, telling us to 'turn off our sense of moral judgment for an hour and a half.' He was right. As a movie, this would probably rate a 2, given it has zero plot, no structure besides randomness, and very little production value. However, that isn't the point. Everyone in our theatre was laughing and gasping the whole way through - not only were some of the stunts creative (see trailer if you need to know but they hid some of the best (or worst depending on how you want to look at it)), but some of the stuff they did took us completely by surprise. These guys do some stuff that won't make it into your newspaper reviews (and probably can't even be published here), involving lots of things below the belt. However, almost 3/4 of the stunts are fantastically hysterical (even if morally condemnable, but remember Knoxville's statement), and if you are in the right mindset this movie is hysterical to watch. Only about 20 minutes of this movie could have actually been shown on TV, so consider yourself warned of what you're getting into - some stuff is disgusting, but instead of being repulsed by it you end up laughing at the sheer stupidity of it all. As a person who thought Jackass the TV show was an over-hyped fad with only a few funny sketches and lots of unnecessary pain, the amount of fun I had at this movie has made me realize that having no boundaries is the best environment for these guys to work in. It's a lot of fun and should be a great comedic fix until the Borat movie comes out. With this movie, you may think you know what you're getting, but these guys are a few steps ahead of you - I guarantee you'll be surprised by the 3rd sketch. So enjoy, and don't worry: you won't want to perform almost any of their stuff at home.",positive

Brilliant performances by the whole cast, but Epps and Rapaport turned in the best and most convincing of either young star's career.<br /><br />However, as a college student myself, many of the issues that Singleton touched on were taken to the extreme. In a sense that, while they are issues faced on many college campuses, they aren't presented as big or out in the open as this movie would make one believe. In some instances, it almost seemed ridiculous to think that something of this nature could actually occur. However, aside from the fact that it was a little over dramatic, the film was brilliant and left me stunned, unable to talk, just think.

"Not all, but most of this story is Buster being mistaken for ""Dead Shot Dan,"" a notorious criminal. <br /><br />There really is no story, just a series of adventures to show off Buster's physical talents, which are amazing, and his comedic timing.

Those latter scenes were the best I thought, with a lot of clever gags involving the hotel elevator where Big Joe and his daughter live. That was Keaton at his best.<br /><br />It's just a madcap half hour that makes little sense, but cares? It's Buster at his slapstick best, or near it, and so it serves its purpose: to entertain us.

"'Doppleganger', ( or 'Journey To The Far Side Of The Sun' as it is more commonly known ) was written ( with input by the late Donald James ) and produced by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, best known for their 'Supermarionation' television shows such as 'Thunderbirds'.<br /><br />The international space agency Eurosec discovers the existence of a mysterious planet on the other side of the sun, and proposes a manned flight be sent there. The committee balk at the exhorbitant cost, and shelve the project. But when a security leak at the agency is discovered, fearing that the Russians might get there first, the project gets the green light.<br /><br />American astronaut Glenn Ross ( Roy Thinnes ) is teamed with British scientist John Kane ( Ian Hendry ). After weeks of gruelling training, the Phoenix blasts off, heading for the unknown.<br /><br />Three weeks later, their ship crashes in what appears to be a bleak, mountainous landscape. Ross survives, but Kane is badly injured. A light is seen moving towards them...<br /><br />I will leave the synopsis here. Until this point, the film has been gripping, with excellent special effects ( by Derek Meddings ) and music by Anderson's resident composer Barry Gray ( why it has not been issued on C.D. is a mystery ). But when Ross and Kane crash land, and we discover the secret of the alien world - it is a duplicate of our own, everyone on it is the same, the only major difference is that things are reversed - it becomes less interesting, and ends with a shattering anti-climax. I think the cinema was the wrong place to do this idea, in fact Gerry & Sylvia later did something similar on their 'Space: 1999' show. Ross risks ( and ultimately loses ) his life in an effort to return to Earth - his Earth. But why? The new Earth is so similar he might as well not have bothered.<br /><br />Roy Thinnes had recently done 'The Invaders' television series, and gives a competent performance ( pity there weren't more scenes like the one where he rows with his wife ). Ian Hendry is good as 'Kane', but vanishes from the story too soon. Several actors went on to appear in the Andersons' 'U.F.O.' such as Ed Bishop and George Sewell. Blink and you will miss Nicholas Courtney ( 'The Brigadier' from 'Dr.Who' in a tiny role ). But the acting honours go to the late Patrick Wymark as 'Jason Webb', head of Eurosec. The character is not far removed from 'Sir John Wilder', the one he played in A.T.V.'s 'The Power Game'. Webb is such a devious character he is marvellous to watch. Herbert Lom's contribution ( as a spy with a camera hidden in a false eye ) amounts to little more than a cameo.<br /><br />Like I said, the special effects are marvellous, as are the sets. So the film is worth watching, but do not expect very much to happen once the action moves to the mirror planet. With a stronger script, this could have been another 'Planet Of The Apes' or - dare I say it - '2001: A Space Odyssey'.<br /><br />In Anderson's productions, he made the future seem like a great place, an adventure playground where science was cool, everyone had swank cars whose doors opened vertically, sexy women, and absolutely no suggestion that anything is seriously wrong with the world. We are in the future now and people are still watching 'Coronation Street' every other night. How disappointing. If a mirror Earth really exists somewhere, one hopes that is a better place than this one. If all the women there look like Lynn Loring or Loni von Friedl, I will be on the next flight!",positive

Scary. You're watching: Children.

"Nell Shipman attempted a plot to lead up to a chase finale in 'Back to God's Country' of the previous year, and she failed miserably. This time, she does better, although it seems pointless. 'Something New' hardly has a plot lying outside of the chase. There's a brief premise, which sets up the hero (co-author and Shipman's boyfriend) to have to save the girl (played by Shipman), then it's nothing but an exciting, implausible chase from there. Of course, it plays out like an hour-long advertisement for a Maxwell Sedan, but the entire movie is congruously ridiculous. It doesn't seem that she learned much from the last-minute rescue films of D.W. Griffith or its parodies by Mack Sennett and other comedians, which she's imitating.<br /><br />One point of interest is that Shipman writes and directs herself into the film as the writer of the film's story, which has as its protagonist a writer (Shipman again), although she doesn't do much else clever or humorous with it, even though she attempts to. Again, others had pioneered the writer's joke in the intertitles, like Anita Loos with 'Wild and Woolly' or Frances Marion with 'A Girl's Folly' (both 1917). At least, Shipman gives the impression that she doesn't take herself or the film seriously--and neither do I. 'Something New,' despite its claim, is hackneyed.",negative
"I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. Based on the reviews, I was honestly expecting it to be bad. I was expecting it to be overly political and feminist. I admit it was political and feminist, but not as bad as I was expecting. It portrayed most men as misogynistic a-holes with only a few shown in a positive light. I've seen Brie Larson in a few other movies and I think she's a pretty good actor, but in this movie I didn't care for her performance. I know she can do a good job so I don't know if it's the directing or the writing, but her performance was pretty bland. I didn't really feel anything from her character at any point during the movie. Most of the other actors were just ok. Even Samuel L. Jackson wasn't as awesome as he normally is, but he still did a good job. Lashana Lynch did a pretty good job too, but sadly she wasn't in the movie that much. There was only one actor who did an awesome job and that was Ben Mendelsohn as Talos. He did a great job and was by far my favorite character in the movie. The Skrulls were the best part of the movie which shouldn't have been the case because they're supposed to be the bad guys and the main character and hero should have been the best part. The action was honestly pretty weak. There was no part in this movie where it felt like there was any great danger for anyone. The best parts about this movie were funny the funny ones. The humor is what made me like this movie because the other aspects of the movie were lacking. Overall this movie was a little better than just ok. It's definitely not the worst Marvel movie, but it is far from my favorite. I will still buy the movie when it comes out because I want to own all of the MCU movies, but I feel that they could have made this movie much better than what we got.",controversial

"This movie was horrible and the only reason it was even made was because the story appealed to the far-left. I consider my self a moderate, so I was able to see this film as the pile of garbage it was. While I'm not a Bush fan, your dislike for GW is not enough of a reason to see this movie.<br /><br />To start, the movie was shot on such low-grade film that it comes off as cheap, rather then artsy. Additionally, the characters are seriously lacking in depth. Chris Cooper's character was a poor parody of George Bush; better suited for Saturday Night Live then a Dramatic film. The rest of the characters are walking clichés and are poor facsimiles of other characters from much better movies.<br /><br />Avoid this movie at all costs!",negative
"Ok so I was bored and I watched it all the way through.<br /><br />This film is mild, inoffensive and lacklustre. The story is so sugary it rots your teeth on the opening titles. A tail of two 'traumatised' children learning about 'God' the fairy story way which frankly left me rather traumatised. It uses the Irish 'blarney' in such a stereotypical way one hopes no true Irish ever see it. Aimed at children who frankly would switch off after the first attempt at an 'OIRISH' accent. All in all why do they pump these out.",negative
"I think it is an exceptional movie. I liked the setting. I liked her origin. It never moves too fast. And It never moves too slow. It's graphics(CGI) were pretty decent. I even preferred them alot more to the thor ragnorak movie graphics. I liked the character development Carol had in the movie. And loved how this movie is filled with funny and heartwarming characters. Carol also has a strong sense for heroism and always leans to do what is right. It's admirable. She never saves people because she has to; But because she wants to. I love that about her. I also want to mention that this is not a feminist movie that bashes men or generalizes them in anyway. As a matter of fact, It's not even a feminist movie at all. Gender is not even mentioned. There was one scene where the girls where like ""lets show these men how we do it""; but that's just it, and ""really"" i didn't take it as a sense of mockery towards men; but instead i took like ""lets show boys that we can be badass too""...So i am always scratching my head when i see articles/reviews saying how this movie was bigoted towards men. It really wasn't. Yes, i do have a few complaints. There are a few negatives; but they aren't as bad as people make them out to be(or there arent as much as people claim there are). My only complaints of the negatives are small and don't affect the overall film. The only thing i disliked was the: ""all cats will eventually turn on you""shit(and the fact that[SPOILER] THAT was how Fury lost his eye. Not EVERYTHING has to be a joke. But Marvel sometimes pushes it a bit too far. I also disliked that they didn't explain her powers a bit more(but i guess that was just a matter of preference and they will probably do that in endgame anyway). Another complaint i have is the ridiculous bohawk that appears on Captain Marvel everytime she powers up. Like what the actual fuck? how is that even? Uggg-- do her powers tell her what type of hairdo they want? Cause...i find that a bit ridiculous and it's hard to take her seriously with that hairdo. But anyways those were the only negatives i had. Overall the film is great and entertaining and depicts an actual portrayal of heroism properly.",controversial
"I wanted to like this movie so badly, but in the end couldn't even make it through the whole thing.  The whole thing just felt bland, lukewarm, and lifeless.  Brie Larson's Captain Marvel was emotionally vacant, and try as I might I just could not connect with the story at all.  Spent the first third of the movie telling myself to just keep watching, it would get better.  Then I just gave up and decided I would literally rather match socks than continue viewing the film.",negative
"I hate people who try to influence me with their own personal agendas. If I let them do that, it means I let others decide for me. No thanks. I ignored the idiots who either didn't even see the movie or went to see it with their minds made up, and decided to make up my own mind about Captain Marvel. So here's my honest opinion:nIt was entertaining, funny and caught me off guard here and there... nBen Mendelsohn as the Skrull Talos was genius! As refreshing as Sam Jackson was when on screen... And Goose the Cat? Appropriately timed humor... I definitely laughed a number of times throughout the film. Now, Brie Larson? nShe did her thing. She played Captain Marvel as she was directed to I'm sure. So with that said, whatever liberties she took as an actress with the character fit who they were trying to make Carol Danvers out to be in the film's story: a strong, powerful woman who rises when expected to stay down and doesn't need to explain herself to no one. Makes her the bad guy kicking badass Captain Marvel is!n...however, I'm excited to see the direction the Russo bros take with her character in Endgame. See, the Russo's I feel do an awesome job at making these powerful superheros feel relatable, by exposing them to their vulnerabilities. And so, when they rise, you as the viewer effortlessly appreciate and cheer for the hero because you saw their struggle, you saw their fall, and you somehow relate to them.nThat, is what was missing from this film. So in the end, I learned who Captain Marvel is, I respect her, but I can't relate to her. So it makes the story suffer just enough. nWith that off my chest, I can honestly give Captain Marvel 4 stars. nNow, go make up your own mind and enjoy the show!",controversial

Most of the people reviewing this are reviewing this under a microscope- looking for reasons to criticize it (as they already do with anything involving a woman). Don't be fooled- this truly is a great movie. It was one of the first times I felt understood by a movie character.

"A tribute to brawn over brains.nnSo finally saw the movie last night..nHad my hopes and expectations set to very low.. (Usually helps)nHowever this movie was very.. Bland..nnLets start with the things i did like.nnMost of the side characters where actually decent. Some where already known others where new, none of them explored very much but at least you got an impression about who they where.nnTalos and Fury both where decent and Fury did a lot of wisecracking a good deal of which was quite fun. Talos in general i liked, calm thoughtful and with more than 2 dimensions.nnNow for the rest.nnThe thing that pissed me off most of all is quite common in movies, and its the inconsistencies..nWe see quite early that tho not at her full power yet she is clearly a lot stronger than the norm, breaking a metal frame that she is locked in.. Skrulls are weaker than her, the big one apparently is stronger tho.. Yet when we get to earth we see a Skrull wrestle with Fury for grip on a gun, how did it not simply take it from him ? We see 2 humans grab CM and hold her for a moment while she is attempting to attack a skrull.. With strengt like hers they would have no effect yet they hold her back.. I know this might seem like rambling.. But ffs make up your mind is she super strong or not ? And same would go for the skrulls..nnThen thereĂŻÂż 1/2 1/2(TM)s the Superman effect.. Nothing quite makes for a boring superhero movie than one where our hero is not challenged.. Basically CM is superman with the absence of kryptonite.. If the villain does not challenge the hero there is no struggle.. So what then are we watching ?.. Its much like the ending of JL, superman arrives and its game over for the bad guy.. Weee how fun..nnThe main character does in no way pull me in.. I donĂŻÂż 1/2 1/2(TM)t care about her what she does and why, a lot of it can be put on the Superman effect i posted above, but thatĂŻÂż 1/2 1/2(TM)s not the only reason.

She had more personality than our main character.. A character with about 5 min. screen time.. I had more insight into her at this point than i did to our main character, her loyalties, her disliking CM which seemed obvious from early on. Its pretty bad when 5 min. screen time gives more about a character than a 2h movie does about the main character.nThe main character is also as my title says a tribute to brawn over brains, she acts like an idiot quite a few times, yet it donĂŻÂż 1/2 1/2(TM)t matter as she can just wave her hands around and it wont matter..nnStory is somewhat acceptable, not like we did not see who was the bad guy from the start of the movie, but oh well what a twist big big surprise.

"What is most striking about this semi-musical set in 1920s Berlin is the marvelous cinematography and editing. It's top of the line from First National in these departments. The story is mildly engaging and similar to the plots of Miller's other two films (SUNNY, SALLY) where working girl is romanced by rich boy with family disapproval, complications and final clinch. All the four musical numbers are bunched at the beginning of the film and we go for a long stretch without any further musical buoyancy. Miller sings parts of I THINK OF BABY and reprises BECAUSE OF YOU. There are also DON'T EVER BE BLUE and THOUGH YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST ONE.<br /><br />Miller here is very engaging and delightful, quite reminiscent of Irene Dunne in manner and delivery. Sad she does not dance as that is her forte. SALLY remains her finest film, with this trailing as second and the rather poor SUNNY a vastly inferior runner up. Her life was tragically cut short by a sinus infection before the days when hospitals and antibiotics made such tragedies preventable. It's worth visiting these films though to see Ziegfeld's top star of the twenties.",negative

"This film comes as the ultimate disappointment in Tsai Ming-Liang for me. It oozes laziness from its every frame. So I'm not going to analyse it thoroughly either. But some observations:<br /><br />1. If the premise is drought, why we get to see city landscapes with blooming green trees? I wonder if that was supposed to mean something in the metaphorical context of the film (in which thirst notifies the craving for intimacy, and watermelon the trivial substitute, sex). Or it is only a matter of lousy film-making, not giving a damn about being coherent.<br /><br />2. We don't get to know what had happened to the porn actress, why she is unconscious or, presumably, dead. It seems a question of no importance as long as the message of supreme alienation is successfully (=bombastically) delivered, but in retrospect, her inert body proves to be a cheap dramaturgical gimmick, a pretext  just as gratuitous and exploitative as the activity it is employed in.<br /><br />3. Nothing is expressed in this movie that Antonioni hadn't expressed better 40 years ago  and without needlessly humiliating his actors.<br /><br />4. The musical numbers (recycled from 'The Hole') felt like a secondary-schooler's idea of artistic counterpointing, executed on that very secondary-school level of skill. If that was the point, the point sucked.",negative

This story is about a troubled young sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke) who tells the painful story of his past to a psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington).

The character learns nothing, the character could have died and I would not have cared less. Also, they act like this is empowering women, however, all the women I went to this with openly stated that this was basically a boy character because there are no feminine qualities about her excluding her hair.

"I am a big fan of Ludlum's work, and of the Covert-one books, and I had often thought how incredible they would be made into a film. Imagine my excitement, then, on learning that such a movie actually existed! The 'Hades Factor' being the first in the series seemed an obvious place to start.<br /><br />From the outset the film was disappointing. Simple elements from the film such as Griffin's first meeting with Smith are needlessly different from the book, and much less exhilarating. Several characters are poorly cast, too. For starters Dorff is woeful as Smith. Not a bad actor, just an incredibly bad choice as he is far too soft, and fails to exhibit many of the features that are definitive of John Smith.<br /><br />Re-naming, re-assignment and even omission of certain characters further degrades this film. For example the removal of Victor Tremont and the entire back-story of the virus, including the involvement of VAXHAM makes the entire point to the film somewhat hazy. Marty Zellerbach is a very large part of the book, and in the seat he takes vary much a back seat (not to mention that the film character shares nothing in common with the character in the book) is another big mistake.<br /><br />Rachel Russel is presumably supposed to be Randi Russel from the book. Not only is she supposed to be the sister of Sophie Amsden (should be called Sophia Russel) but she is also supposed to work from the CIA, NOT ""Covert-one"". Which brings me to my final point, and I think one of the most important. COVERT-ONE doesn't even exist at this point! Not until the second book of the series is Covert-One devised by the president as a preventative measure against further biological terrorism.<br /><br />To be honest I could go on all day. In short - if you like the books and want to see a good adaptation, I'm afraid you'll be bitterly disappointed. Even as an action movie it is thoroughly average, mainly due to very lack-luster editing and poor effects. The bumbled story line and dull-as-ditch-water script are the final nails in the very cheap coffin of this film.",negative

"Unspeakable starts in Los Angeles with Jim (Roger Cline) & his wife Alice Fhelleps (Tamera Noll) arguing as they drive along in the pouring rain, unfortunately Jim crashes the car & his daughter Heather (Leigh Silver) ends up dead while Alice is turned into a wheelchair bound vegetable. Devastated by the death of his daughter Jim starts visiting prostitutes, he then kills them because of voices in his head. Erm, that's it really.<br /><br />Written, produced & directed by Chad Ferrin I hate Unspeakable as a film. There are some films you occasionally see that move the 'goal posts' as it were in regard to everything you watch thereafter, some films are so brilliant that all other's will be judged by it while other's like Unspeakable for example are so bad that it sets a new cinematic low. This is truly one of the worst films I've ever seen & I am seriously surprised by the largely positive comments on the IMDb although I'm not surprised the the low overall rating on the main page, I not sure if I missed something but for a start Unspeakable has no plot, it has no story & a lot of it seems almost random. There was nothing in Unspeakable to maintain my interest or entertain & as a result became a test of endurance to get through to the end. The film tries to be shocking with some limp scenes of sexual abuse of a rent boy by a priest, there is a scene in which a disabled person craps herself, it splats on the floor & her dodgy male nurse starts feeling her soiled genitals, legs & underwear. If anyone can find such crap entertaining then I'll just cut my wrists now, the character's are some of the worst I've had the misfortune to know, the dialogue is hilariously bad with some it sounding like it came straight from some dirty faggot porno of the worst kind. It doesn't work as a horror as it's not scary in the slightest, it's absolutely hilarious & frankly insulting to claim that it is trying to be a serious drama about someone suffering a great loss & attempting to cope with it & overall I just think it's a pointless, rubbishy, badly made piece of crap from Troma.<br /><br />Director Ferrin films like some badly made documentary, the special effects are terrible & are of the 'let's pour tomato ketchup on our actor's face & the audience will be convinced that they died a gory death' variety, there is no graphic violence at all apart from a suicide where someone sticks a knife in their own mouth. Considering the amount of prostitutes in Unspeakable the nudity levels are kept to an absolute minimum...<br /><br />Apparently Unspeakable had a budget of about $20,000 & all I can say is where did all the money go? Oh, a quick note to the filmmakers, if your going to record sound live make sure you don't have your actor's deliver their lines next to a main road that half of Los Angeles seem to be driving up... The acting sucks, period.<br /><br />Unspeakable is, in my opinion, total crap.

"Nazarin by the acclaimed surrealist Bunuel is ovbviously an attack on the Catholic Church and its loss of values. It is not a visual film and I think it would have played better on the stage. Bunuel takes us through this man, the nazarene that lives like Christ lived; a true follower i.e. in poverty, and without a care for property and what the next day bringeth. Some might call it a parallel to Christ's story but any follower and practitioner of the word, life should be like Christ in a way. But in essence Bunuel also inquires into the ogle of man's selfishness and need to sin and how goodness may save us all. It is a bold statement to make that may enliven, or recite to memory the movie for some. Truth, be told the Nazarene is also selfish because he gives without wanting in return or asking for it. His selfishness is his folly and the two women who follow him represent the sides of a coin;with the same face on each side. Lots of people represent sides of a coin in this movie, all with both faces the same. But the movie isn't exactly memorable once it ends and one could attack many of its ethical perforations and effusions within the movie's own doctrine. Not top-notch Bunuel but a ""surreal"" dream sequence that bunuel stages whithin where the message of the movie is framed and is worth noting for it shows you the capability of the director, Bunuel.",positive
"Imaginary Heroes, the remarkable work of the then 24 year-old Dan Harris, is tag-lined ""People are never who they seem to be"". Perhaps this is wisely chosen as a stratagem of marketing; yet, I rented this movie in spite of the tag-line, rather than because of it. And, I'm glad I did. I found the move an insightful examination of tragedy. I personally found it to be a movie about coping with dreams: particularly those which are lost. In the case of one son, ""loss"" requires deep examination of what he had, and didn't have, in his life. Yet, the central tragedy of the movie, while posing enticing questions in its own right, acts primarily as the backdrop against which different coping styles are set into relief. I believe the film inquires into an important question: how do we cope with our dreams, particularly where heroes become imaginary?",positive

I think it was a little unfair judged, because just like Iron Man 1, Captain America: The First Avenger (ironic name now), and especially Thor 1, it's an origin story so it's full of exposition and doesn't quite have it's legs, even more so since it has way more to live up to than the first few Marvel movies that came out did.

"This movie is one of the most provocative Jesus movies I have ever seen. It does not seek to tell the whole story, but only to portray an interpretive expression of the last day of Jesus Christ. It is darkly witty, playful and seriously faithful to elements of the Jewish tradition and to modern scriptural interpretation. Judas is much more ordinary than other portrayals, not the dark and sinister evil that we sometimes imagine, but a grossly mistaken man, horribly misguided in his zeal. Chris Saranden's Jesus is playful and serious, faithful and committed--very human while also divine. The final dialog is thoughtfully done and serves as the kind of small talk that two powerful men might do when they have just committed an atrocity. I would watch this movie again and recommend it to others.",positive

"please, future writers, producers, directors - learn from this movie!<br /><br />never before have i seen such a bold and original tale created for the big movie screen. bold, because the script constantly made a step so many fantasy movies safely avoided - a step to something new, creative and daring. just when you think 'oh, i've seen this before' or 'i am sure this is what will happen now' - StarDust would make an unexpected twist and involve you more and more into the story.<br /><br />the actors are great - even the smallest part is performed with such talent it fills me with awe for the creators of this movie. Robert De Niro is gorgeous and performs with such energy that he simply steals the show in each scene he's in. Michelle Pfeiffer is the perfect witch, and Claire Danes a wonderful choice for the innocent and loving 'star', Yvaine. Other big names make outstanding roles. I had the filling everyone is trying to give his best for this movie. But once again, the story by Neil Gaiman, all the little things he 'invented' for this universe - simply outstanding.<br /><br />I watched this movie at a pre-screening today, a day before the official release, and do hope it will have huge success. There is so much humor, but also tense moments as well as lovely tender scenes. The look in the eyes of Yvaine, the 'frivolities' of Captain Shakespeare, the passion of Lamia the witch - impressive, unforgettable<br /><br />For me this is the number one entertaining movie of 2007, watch it and enjoy it<br /><br />11/10 - Outstanding<br /><br />peace and love",positive

"Unusual film about a man who befriends his social opposite out of fear of blackmail. Peter Boyle makes this film with his foul mouthed boorish portrayal of a working class stiff ""Joe"" in love with the past and fearful of the future and worried about the present. The first half hour of the show features the film debut of a young Susan Sarrandon as Melissa Compton, a weak willed rich girl who slums with her loser boyfriend, replete with a full nude scene. Her boyfriend is the film's weak spot, a poorly portrayed drug addict and dealer who meets his demise following Sarrandon's overdose. We meet Boyle's Joe in a bar as he spouts off and rants about minorities, crime, hippies and drugs, and it is easy to see that the later Norman Lear television character of Archie Bunker is based on a cleaned up version of Joe. The comparison even carries over into Joe's wife and personal life and pastimes. Joe insinuates himself into the life of Bill Compton, Melissa's father, and the two make an unlikely pair as they search for Melissa who has run away from drug treatment and back to the drug addicts she calls friends. Their search leads them to an ""oar-gee"" as Joe calls it, a free love fest fueled by drugs a lot of nudity and surprisingly, uptight Bill Compton and Ultra Conservative Joe both join in. They get robbed and this leads to a violent and murderous ending that foreshadows the stark and chilling ending to Taxi Driver six years later. Joe is a funny film that on the surface at least, is anti violence and anti racist. Yet the film's main character, Joe, becomes the very instrument of the upheaval he fears when he enters and joins in the illegal and unbridled sexual excesses he rants against. So in that respect, the film falls short of being a powerful message and leaves you wondering what the final outcome really was all about.",positive
"Near the closing stages of Baby Mama, one of the central characters goes on to describe the basic outline of everything that came before and summarises that it 'was all just a mess'; I really couldn't say it any better than that. And while the feature does have its odd ray of hope every now and again, the vast majority of what is present is too neutered to be considered relevant and too unremarkable to be worth anyone's time. A lacklustre cast, mundane script and vague, caricature characters ensure that Baby Mama certainly isn't taxing on the ol' noggin, but it never makes up for this through its proposed sense of humour. Consisting mainly of very routine, cliché jokes based around an odd couple (rich and poor) trying to live with each other as they prepare to bring a baby into the world, the film is far too esoteric to deliver laughs outside its very thin demographic.<br /><br />As a story on finding love, it's not that bad, but playing this plot line as a side-story of sorts to work alongside the comedy-orientated odd couple tangent, characterisation is notably weak, resulting in a lukewarm romance that never bubbles. As characters themselves, both central figures are mildly amusing when put together in small spaces, but when left alone quickly unravel and bare their emptiness; so while we may eventually come to find the character's interactions with each other amusing at times, the comedy never branches beyond distant chuckles; we don't feel for the characters and don't find them inherently interesting, but rather their dynamic. Unfortunately however, although this dynamic works best, or at least better than the individual personas, as mentioned above, it rarely stems outside of the typical confines of the odd-couple formula.<br /><br />Kate (Tina Fey) is a successful business woman who has hired working class, dumb-blonde Angie (Amy Poehler) to be her unlikely surrogate, and after Angie decides to leave hopeless husband Carl (Dax Shepard), both eventually have to learn to live together despite their obvious differences. Yes, it's the typical odd-couple premise, and one that we have already seen in this year's What Happens in Vegas, yet what Baby Mama lacks that the aforementioned movie had is both chemistry between performers and semi-layered characters. Kate and Angie both fail to ever show much of a personality outside of their two dimensional outline and as such both performers are neglected to play out roles that demand chemistry to produce out of thin air. In fact, the movie's only real engaging performance and character comes from the underused talents of Romany Malco who gets lumbered with playing a door-man. Of the few times that I laughed during Baby Mama, most of those moments were because of this man, and the remainder usually fell to Shepard.<br /><br />It's a rare thing of course to find a movie which embodies its script's themes in the way which its world is shot and presented to us through the camera, and yet director Michael McCullers goes from page to screen effectively enough. Yet, for a film about babies, multi-million dollar business and cultural stereotyping, this isn't necessarily a good thing. Baby Mama is grade-A, hammy, plastic tinsel-town with capital bore topped with sugar. So not only did I feel emotionally distant to the characters because of their two-dimensional nature, but I simply didn't care for the world they inhabited. The dialogue, along with sets, costumes, and the script's general themes are painted in pastel blues and pinks so much that all shades of humanity are lost in the director's incessant need to make his movie feel like a neutered fantasy; these aren't characters and that isn't our world in any way so why should I care? At the end of the day however, a romantic comedy's ultimate gauge of success or failure comes down purely to its chemistry between its love interests, and the frequency of its laughs; Baby Mama has little going on in any of these departments. Of course to say that the film is without any value at all would be unfair. I'm sure female audiences in a similar boat as lead character Kate may get a slight kick out of the proceedings, but anyone else will probably just feel numb and probably bored. In this respect Baby Mama avoids being unbearable, but never convinces in being anything remarkable or worthy of a look to anyone outside of its immediate audience; a comedic dud and a romantic mismatch, Baby Mama is too light-headed to be interesting and too shallow to be entertaining.<br /><br />- A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",negative

"Chan Wook Park is nothing if not inventive. I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK is chock full of amusing little technical flourishes with some ingenious ideas sprinkled in between. Attempting to walk in the footsteps of the likes of Marc Caro and Jeunet (CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, DELICATESSEN), Park embarks on a fanciful, lighthearted tale which is a radical departure from his usual morbid fare. Hardly one to be faulted for his ambition or his vision, it is genuinely unexpected, then, to see all Park's effort add up to so very little.<br /><br />I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK seems astonishingly to subtract from itself as it goes along, with the the end result being a fraction of the sum of its parts. The premise is promising, gags are copious and offbeat humour abounds but it all fails miserably to create any meaningful connection with the audience. The characters are cute and quirky and played with gusto by the cast, but, try as i might, i could not bring myself to care for any.<br /><br />SYMPATHY FOR LADY VENGEANCE was a misstep, indicating perhaps that Park was overindulging himself a little bit, but it still managed to showcase some of the director's unique flare and in the wake of an impressive filmography, was readily forgiven. None of the assured confidence that commanded JOINT SECURITY AREA or SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE is evident here. I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK left me so utterly unengaged i caught myself instinctively fast forwarding from time to time (more regularly as the film progressed). I gave LADY a 5/10, and by that measure, this probably deserves no more than a 3. For old time's sake, i'll be generous: 4/10",negative
"I love to see a female protagonist, in this movie her name was Rose. Rose brought out a lot of interesting questions in her journey of fulfillment.Is is possible to attain peace and internal fulfillment through external means? Does our society teach this? Can one be a victim of memory which may lead to victimizing others? Is one responsible for being a product of one's environment? To what extent can one control or take control of one's environment? How is a ""typical"" human alike or different than Rose? Lastly, would the outcome or story change if it were from another country like France or Italy?

"Hitchcock once gave an interview where he said he like to direct screenplays that had an ordinary person minding their own business, who's accidentally caught up in an awful chain of events that they can't get out of until the dastardly plot that's behind their troubles is resolved. That way, the audience can feel more sympathy for the hero. We certainly do in this fine film. Barry Kane is only trying to help his fellow-man out by performing acts of kindness and consideration, like helping Fry pick up the letters he dropped at the factory. Barry even returns a lost $100 bill to Fry later on...that was BIG money in 1943!! It's Barry's acts of Christian kindness that get him into trouble and soon, he's wrongly accused of sabotage and murder and will likely hang if he can't clear himself. Similar to The 39 Steps in plot, the hero travels cross-country where he discovers plans for further acts of terrorism by fascisistic cells, an arch-villain who nobody could believe to be a closet-Nazi, and a beautiful blonde, Patricia Martin, who first suspects and hates then eventually falls in love with Barry Kane. Hitch's trademark touches of humor are here, too. Patricia is a billboard model who's various roadside ads are a help and comfort to Barry as he hitches a ride with the bad guys, all the way from Las Vegas to NYC. We meet a trucker who's a one-man comedy act ""Someone convinced my wife it was stylish to eat three meals a day."" Field employees of the fascist spy ring grouse about being forgotten or ignored by the ""suits"" just as if they were working for some legit enterprise. During a chase scene into a cinema, audience members laugh at the action of a schlocky comedy/gangster flick as the saboteur cell shoots it out for real with the good guys and accidentially kills a guffawing movie-patron. Awful for the dead old man, but funny! Hitch liked to use famous monuments in his movies and this is the best instance, with the Statue of Liberty as backdrop and ironic icon! It works even better than the Mt Rushmore scene in NBNW.",positive
"The Book gets 10 out of 10 stars...<br /><br />PROBABLY CONTAINS SPOILERS OF BOTH THE BOOK AND THE MOVIE!!!<br /><br />If you've never read Geoffrey Household's Rogue Male, the source material for Man Hunt, you'll likely enjoy Fritz Lang's treatment of the story. On the other hand, if you're in my camp and have practically memorized the book, the movie will be a crashing disappointment. I'll assume you've already read a synopsis of the story, and proceed to my complaints. Household's little novel is one of the all-time great suspense classics, taut and spare, with only a bare handful of characters to propel the action. Fritz Lang and his screen writer Dudley Nichols feel the need to throw in the protagonist's brother and a sympathetic floozy, the latter of which reduces the depth of the story by injecting an extrinsic motivation into the screenplay where the novel needed none. In fact, the true climax of the book was not the nameless narrator's escape from his underground lair, but rather his self-acceptance of his true motive for going on his hunt in the first place. And that's another thing: if David Fincher and Quentin Tarantino can get us all the way through Fight Club and Kill Bill 1 without revealing the names of their respective protagonists, why can't Lang? ""Thorndyke?"" What hat did they pull that out of? Which brings me to my bitterest complaint: Household's hunter is so quintessentially British,he would bleed a Union Jack if you cut him. But Walter Pigeon, who plays him, is Canadian! He can barely sustain the accent, which is only slightly deeper and more convincing that Kevin Costner's in Robin Hood. He looked about right in the role, and was a fine actor for the 1940s,but as Rogue Male's reluctant hero? Let's look to the Sceptered Isle itself for a more convincing version. Remake soon with subtlety and with, please! I'll direct it for free",negative
"Maybe it's just because I have an intense fear of hospitals and medical stuff, but this one got under my skin (pardon the pun).

Some parts are very reminiscant of ""Hellraiser"", but come off as tribute rather than imitation.

Its not really broken any new ground in terms of a super hero origin story, and there's a twist with the villain you'll either love or hate, but it's fast, fun, witty (in places) and has some pretty cool 90s nostalgia. Larson is convincing if not scene stealing and shares great chemistry with Jackson. Mendalsohn and Lynch are both superb with Ben in particular filling each of his scenes with charm and charisma. Overall, highly entertaining and a great taster of what could be to come for the MCU. Don't believe any of this faux, anti-feminist outrage. This film is no more anti-male than anything that's come before it. If anything it's an ode to the strength of human spirit and determination and it just happens to be that our hero is a kick ass woman.",controversial

"Have you ever wondered why these guys -- Seagal, Stallone, Willis, et al -- manage to survive all those gunfights in which they're outnumbered? I think I've got it figured out. The enemies always miss, and the hero doesn't.<br /><br />Here, Seagal has a pistol and outshoots a half dozen heavies firing at him from a few feet away. One of the heavies has a shotgun. Or maybe two of them have. It doesn't really matter. There could be a thousand shotguns blasting away at him and Seagal would still emerge with his ponytail intact.<br /><br />And when it comes to mano a mano combat -- forget it. The evildoers may or may not be armed with swords or knives or blunt object but Seagal, with his skill in aikido or tempura or sushido or play-do or whatever it is, brushes them aside with a few dismissive blows. Not only is he a master of these outré skills but his physical strength is Herculean. More than once he snaps somebody's long bones as easily as we would break a toothpick. One he breaks a guy's SPINE over his knee.<br /><br />I'll tell you something. (I'm getting into the spirit of the film here because Seagal uses that line, ""I'll tell you something,"" several times, along with, ""What's that supposed to mean?"") These guys are fully deserving of extinction in any good Xenophobe's handbook. They are all black, speak with unintelligible Jah-MAY-can accents, wear dreadlocks that look in dire need of a shampoo, they torture and murder with aplomb, and -- here's the worst part. They're unchristian. That's right. They practice voodoo.<br /><br />Actually the voodoo element comes close to being the most interesting element of the film. They got the constituents of the ritual pretty well -- cigar smoke, rum spitting, the sacrificial chicken. They only left out the possession dance in which the spirit rides the dancer. They should have read Metraux on voodoo.<br /><br />Otherwise the plot adheres to the usual conventions. What was done to Jaqueline Bissett by the voodoo-practitioners in ""The Deep"" is done here to a friend of Seagal's. What was done to John Wayne when he was stuck between trucks in ""McQ"" is done here to Seagal himself. At the movie's very opening, when Seagal makes a brief speech about having seen too much pointless violence in his DEA career so he's now happily retired, and when we are introduced to his friends and family, I tried to keep track of his affiliates to see if I could pick out which ones would be horribly murdered or maimed to generate his quest for revenge.<br /><br />The acting doesn't really require much comment. But Charles, the Jamaican cop, played by Tom Wright, is really pretty good. Wright has considerable range. Here, he's an associate of dubious allegiance, rather sinister. But in ""The Pentagon Wars"" he has a comic part that he underplays perfectly.<br /><br />The Jamaicans never flew as movie villains. I don't know why exactly. It's a small movie market. And if you go to Jamaica stick to Montego Bay. However, if you want to see Jamaican voodoo drug dealers as heavies, and if you're in the mood for another typical-standard action flick, this should be a satisfying view.",negative
"BONJOUR, MONSIEUR SHLOMI is simply a wonderful film! Writer/Director Shemi Zarhin has created a story unlike any other and cast it with such consistently fine actors that it remains a puzzle to me that this film has not become an audience favorite throughout the world. It is intelligent, emotional, edifying, and warm, entertaining, and in all categories it is a winner.Shlomi (Oshri Cohen, in a brilliantly understated performance) is a 16-year-old lad who takes care of his highly dysfunctional family: his mother (Esti Zakheim) is about as distasteful a shrew as ever concocted and in a constant state of ill temper because of her husband cheated on her, and because she is stuck working double shifts to support her ailing father-in-law (Ariek Elias, who as Shlomi's grandfather is a bright, funny, wise, loving old man who deeply cares for Shlomi); a married sister Ziva (Rotem Abuhab)who periodically moves back in to the house because of constant spats with her husband who doesn't help her care for their infant twin sons; his brother Sasi (Assi Cohen) whose life is loud electric guitars, braggadocio about female conquests, and the favorite son of his mother. Stir this mixture and the result is the penultimate dysfunctional family unit. Shlomi cooks gourmet meals for them, shops, cleans house, runs errands, bathes and cares for this grandfather and in general leads a life of submission to a family that views him as a 'retard'.Shlomi longs for a girlfriend and practically fails his school because of his lack of time devoted to caring for his family and a lack of concentration. Serendipitously his math teacher Begin (Nisso Keavia) notes his natural mathematic genius on a discarded test, and with the aid of the headmaster (Yigal Nair) the two encourage him to be tested and discover that he is a genius (?with dyslexia?) and arrange for him to try for a special school in Haifa. Shlomi's mother will hear none of it but between fights with Shlomi's absentee father (Albert Iluz) and confrontations with the teacher and headmaster they finally consent to his testing for the school.Meanwhile Shlomi discovers a girl his age Rona (Aya Koren) who has moved in next door and gradually the two become intertwined in a physical and intellectual relationship. Always in the background is the support of Shlomi's grandfather, and when the grandfather dies, Shlomi sets off on the journey to live his life for himself, to realize his gifts, to find his happiness. The manner in which the family comes to grips with this is the peak of the movie and need not be revealed for the sake of loosing the power of the message.The film is beautifully photographed, the musical score is creatively lovely, and the final result is one of exaltation of the human spirit. Highly recommended on every level. In Hebrew with English subtitles.",positive

"A less-than-subtle poke at the beliefs and teachings of the Catholic Church is given a darker shade of death near the end of the show.

To celebrate her school's 25th anniversary, she invites her first students to return and perform their Christmas pageant.<br /><br />However, when the quartet ""update"" their play to parody Sister Mary's ""fallacious"" teachings, the nun is pushed over the edge, sending the story spiralling into a chain of unhappy events.

"Heftig og Begeistret (Intense and Enthusiastic) is a documentary-like story of a male choir up in Berlevåg in the very northern part of Norway, where the weather is cold and hostile, the days are dark during the winter and the towns are faced with young people moving to the more populated parts in the south of Norway, where the climate is warmer and there are more opportunities.<br /><br />The most beautiful part of this movie is the humans themselves. The people in the choir, who are aged from 30 to 95, all have unique, colorful lives and are very enjoyable beings. They are characterised by the harsh climate and the recession of the North and have adapted to the way of living required. Throughout the movie, we learn a bit about many people in the choir and we follow them through songs, some events in a church and on the harbour, and in the end, a trip to Murmansk.<br /><br />The outside environment filmed in the movie is very beautiful and characterised by the Norwegian nature. The scenography is also natural and taken directly from the choir and from the peoples lives that we meet. Thei r livingrooms, the bathroom, the kettle on the oven; there is nothing artificial about this movie, not the people, not the environment, not their music and not their feelings. Everything is as real as can be.<br /><br />It all loses out though when it comes to giving a story. It is very beautiful and real, but why do we see it? Is it because of the songs? Is it because of the nature? Or is it simply just to see a story about Berlevåg Mens-Choir, about their life and some of the trips they have. The message, if there is any, is that this small society copes with life through such social events like the choir. The choir have kept the people together for many many years.<br /><br />It is all nice, but being as popular as it has been, seen by almost 200.000 in Norway, there is something wrong. There is no beginning or end to it. Nobody gains or loses anything, nobody reveals any message or tries to convince the audience of that this is good or that life up there is great. Why was this movie made?<br /><br />I am sorry. It is a nice movie about good people, but compared to the average European, Scandinavian or Norwegian movie - this does not deserve a 9 out of 10. It is closer to 4 out of 10, and that is what I will give it.<br /><br />If you see this movie in a theater, you should expect the average age on the audience to be around 55-60. It has reported to be consistently high in all theaters. Maybe this is also the reason for it receiving such very high praise in the news and good grades also on the IMDB: It is a movie about elders, for elders. It is a movie of ""I regret nothing in my life"", and a story saying that living in a small town like Berlevåg, might be a nice life too.",negative

"Dan, the widowed father of three girls, has his own advice column that will probably go into syndication. After his wife's death, he has taken time to raise his daughters. Having known no romance in quite some time, nothing prepares him for the encounter with the radiant Marie, at a local book store in a Rhode Island small town on the ocean, where he has gone to celebrate Thanksgiving with the rest of his big family. After liking Marie at first sight, little prepares him when the gorgeous woman appears at the family compound. After all, she is the date of Dan's brother, Mitch.<br /><br />It is clear from the outset that Dan and Marie are made for one another, and although we sense what the outcome will be, we go for the fun ride that Peter Hedges, the director wants to give us. Mr. Hedges, an author and screenplay writer on his own, has given us two excellent novels, ""What's Eating Gilber Grapes"", and ""An Ocean in Iowa"", and the delightful indie, ""Pieces of April, which he also directed. It's just a coincidence that both movies deal with families during Thanksgiving reunions.<br /><br />The best thing in the film was the natural chemistry between the two stars, Steve Carell and Juliette Binoche. Mr. Carell, in fact, keeps getting better all the time. In many ways, he remind us of Jack Lemmon, in his take of comedy and serious material. What can one say about Ms. Binoche, an intelligent actress, and a bright presence in any film. She proves she is right up to doing comedy, convincing us about her Marie.<br /><br />The only sad note is the waste of talent in the picture. John Mahoney, Diane Wiest, Norbert Leo Butz, Jessica Hecht, Emily Blunt, Allison Pill, Amy Ryan, have nothing to do. They just serve as incidental music for decoration. Dane Cook, who is seen as brother Mitch, fares better because he gets to recite more lines than the others.<br /><br />""Dan in Real Life"" is a delightful film that will please everyone.",positive

"I love sharks. And mutants. And explosions. Theoretically, with those parameters in mind, HAMMERHEAD: Shark Frenzy should have been the best movie ever.<br /><br />It is not.<br /><br />The monster looks like a villain from Power Rangers, and has approximately the same range of rubbery movement. This might be okay if the makers weren't quite as proud of its design as they seem to be. That is to say, for a guy in a big rubber suit in an action/scifi/horror flick that could benefit from some mystery, the shark gets a lot of screen time. Granted, it is usually shaky and erratic. I guess you're supposed to assume that it's so scary that even the camera guy freaks out.<br /><br />The camera goes to a person about to get eaten, the camera goes to the shark. The camera goes back to the person about to get eaten, only now they are screaming and armless. And so on.<br /><br />The costuming is bad, the acting is poor, and the special effects are sub-par, but the writing is by far the worst. Things happen completely randomly so that more people can be eaten, or so something can explode. Because LET ME TELL YOU, the people who made this movie definitely went in with a more explosions = more better mindset. Characters shoot cars and there is a massive explosion. They shoot helicopters, there is a massive explosion. Barrels, rocks, trees, WHATEVER, they all explode, so much so that the freaking shark even explodes at the end.<br /><br />Speaking of which, I don't care how crazy a person is, I find it hard to believe that anyone would think trying to make a giant half-person half-shark have sex with a woman in order to make freaky shark people babies is a good idea. That is, UNLESS that person is the mad scientist in this movie.<br /><br />The bad thing is, the movie is so random (and at times, boring) that even its badness is not really enough to hold a person's prolonged interest. It might be a good one to MST3K with your friends, but past that, if you happen to catch this bad boy on, do yourself a favor and change the channel.",negative

"For the most part I enjoyed the movie and was pleasantly surprised and charmed by Brie Larsen's performance, especially the chemistry between her and Sam Jackson's Fury. I was a little worried going in, because none of the trailers showed us the nuance of her characterization, so seeing this movie within the context of the whole puts alot of some of the Youtuber's complaints about her character and acting to rest in my mind. That being said, there was still a few glaring problems that I noticed that really should've been addressed in greater detail. For instance: the relationship between Carol and her friend Maria Rambeau and her daughter Monica needed to be the emotional hook for the movie and so little time was spent nurturing this pivotal relationship that the film makers really did her character a disservice. For another: the motivation and purpose behind Annette Bennings Mar-Vell characters building of this super advanced hyperdrive was not fully fleshed out and realized, and again, here is another pivotal relationship from Danvers past that wasn't given the right amount of screen time to show just how much the Dr. Lawson character, aka Mar-Vell influenced Carol as an Air Force pilot. A few extra scenes via flashback as more and more of her memories came back to her would've increased the power and the emotional hook of the film. Black Panther was about 2 hrs 20 minutes. Why couldn't the filmmakers add an extra 15 minutes to runtime to nail down the importance of these two strong female characters and how their influence shaped Carol's worldview as a hero. The final issue I have may upset all the woke people who ignorantly believe all men who do not subjugate themselves to the will of public opinion as women hating pigs, but . . .  I have issue with the retcon that the inspiration for Fury naming the team the Avengers came from an unearned nickname Carol had as an Air Force pilot. I say unearned because the movie never showed any flashbacks of her time as a pilot in which she Avenged ANYONE! Granted, she did some Avenging as Captain Marvel in the second half of the film, but that still doesn't explain how she earned the nickname as an Air Force pilot. Again, an extra five minute scene showing how she earned that title would've been enough for me to forgive this retcon. I call it a retcon because the MCU already established the fact that Captain America was the one true inspiration for the Avengers name, hence The First Avenger being in the title of his first film that took place during WW2, fifty years before Carol Danvers hit the scene. nIn closing, there is nothing wrong with having a powerful female hero in the MCU--we already have a few good ones, notably Scarlet Witch, who I believe is in the top tier of the Avengers and when she cuts loose, like in that battle scene in Wakanda near the end of Infinity War, her power is awesome and I look forward to Danvers teaching her how to truly cut loose and fully own her powers in Endgame. That being said, you shouldn't need to elevate a female hero by negating the power and might of her male counterparts. It saddens me how intolerant this new form of tolerance has become. If this statement sounds silly to you, it sounds silly to me too, and shows just how obtuse and myopic our society has become.",controversial

"Higher. Futher. Faster.n	There is of course a lot of controversy around the star of Marvel's newest outing, Brie Larson, at the moment and she has of course angered quite a few people. This has indeed affected the film negativly, but I'm not here to talk contoversies and hate. I am here to talk about the streangths and pit falls of this film.n	To be completely honest, I loved it! This movie is chalked full of laughs, thrills, and excitement. Brie Larson is the new Captain now! It is apparent from the start of the film to the end of the second tag scene (yes there are 2 tag scenes) that both the cast and the crew who worked on this endevour greatly cared about it. It's of course not the first female lead comic book movie from a major studio, but that shouldn't matter. Captain Marvel has been said to be a feminist movie, and that is true, but I feel that it can be inspiring to all.n	Even with all this praise, the film is by no rights perfect, just like any other film. One of the few things that bothered me during my viewing was how unflinchingly confident Carol Danvers seemed to be. It erased all sense of danger the charater might have been in for me and yes I know that she is by design, the most powerful hero to be introduced in to the MCU to date, but as and origin story, I would have not hated the idea of her falling to her lowest point and finding the courage to rise Higer. Further. Faster. Yeah, you see what I did there. What we got, amongst so many really cool fight sequences, was a hero who could walk through anything without breaking a sweat.  The other thing that bothered me has more to do with the maketing. Goose, the cat like alien, was sold to me to be a huge scene stealer. I went in expecting to laugh most due to this charater. While he is funny and quite a welcome addition, in my opinion, he his not what he was sold to me to be. To make this explenation short, (spoiler alert) he is what the comic community knows as a Flerken. These are cat like creatures that when they open there mouths, can reach out and ensnare anything within a tangle of tentacles. Sounds cool right? It was pretty frigging cool.n	There are a few more things that may bother other comic fans about the movie, like the reveal of Mar-Vell and how Fury lost his eye, but to me, these were small things that did not damage my cinema going experience and won't matter to casual fans of the movies.n	Captian Marvel does have a lot to love within its 2 hour runtime. Chief among them is that it is a blast. Like I mentioned earlier, the hard work and devotion is apparent. Something Marvel Studios has been working on since the production of Ant-Man, has been de-aging technology. The movie takes place in the 90's, which is atleast a decade before the events of the first Iron Man. So for characters like Nick Fury and Agent Coulson to appear, they obviously need to look younger then they currently do.  Samuel L. Jackson (Nick Fury) and Clark Gregg (Agent Coulson) are 70 years old and 56 years old respectively, appear to be at least half their age convincely thoughout the film. This is quite an achivment in the film industry and opens the door to so many possiblities. While I'm talking about returning characters, I can't fail to mention the return of 2 Guardians of the Galaxy characters, Korath (Djimon Hounsou) and Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace). The addition of these 2 helps weave more connective tissue though the MCU and is a great nod to all the fans who have been watching these films since the beginning. n	 I also feel that I must mention the movies villians. Though not as methodical as soon of the MCU's greatest, the villians of Captian Marvel will not be what you expect. In truth they can be anyone in the film and I thought the reveal was done in a decently thought out way. I do look forward to seeing the Skrulls and Kree reappear in future MCU outings. Plus I don't know why but Talos's (Ben Mendelsohn) science ""guy"" is probably my favorite non main character in the movie.n	To conclude this review, yes this film does have it's problems, but I do believe it also has merits that out weigh them. Weather or not you agree with some of the changes the film made to the source material or if some of the comments Brie Lawson has made while on her press tour, this film is a great addition to the constantly growing universe that Kevin Fiege and the Marvel team have created. I urge you to treat yourself and give this film a chance and build your own opinion.  7/10nSynopsisnCaptain Marvel is an extraterrestrial Kree warrior who finds herself caught in the middle of an intergalactic battle between her people and the Skrulls. Living on Earth in 1995, she keeps having recurring memories of another life as U.S. Air Force pilot Carol Danvers.

It makes sense at the end of the film so I understand the creative decision behind it however it doesn't play very well on screen. It felt like they focused so much on making her a ""strong female"" that they forgot to make her human. Young Nick Fury is hilarious so that was fun. Lashana Lynch and Akira Akbar steal the show in every scene. They deliver the most organic performances of the film and I would love to see them in more films. nnIt's still a much better film than most films out there however at this point the bar in the MCU films is so high that it did not live up to expectations. I'd say it's slightly better than the first two Thor movies which is disappointing for a phase 3 film.",negative
"Entered this movie with an open mind. This movie was quite disappointing. The beginning was very boring and set a predictable plot twist in one of the first scenes during the training sessions with Capt. M and Yon-Rogg when he denies to explain Capt.M's past that he obviously knows. The skrulls were made out to be reasonable / sympathetic aliens that have historically been ruthless/deceiving villains throughout marvel comic book history. Which ruins any chance that Marvel has at introducing the secret invasion story line. Talos' appearance in Rambeau's home was completely redicules along with his mannerisms,voice etc. Fight scenes were mediocre at best The entire humor / comic relief was very forced. And the 1995 setting was totally useless to the plot other than the few catchy throw back tunes of the time. The cat with tentacles irritated me and I felt that it was just for a quick laugh for the pre teen audience that loved Dead Pool 2. Brie Larson's appearance / powers were great and fell right with the true captain marvel. Her personality/character I believe will not have an impact on the MCU compared to RDJ or Chris Evans , Hemsworth etc other than she might assist in nailing Thanos in his coffin. All together this film didn't really affect the MCU and only answered questions for â€śfansâ€ť who didn't know what the sign on Fury's pager meant at the end of Infinity war.

"A flying saucer manned (literally) by a crew of about 20 male space explorers travels hundreds of millions of light years from earth to check in on a colony founded some 25 years ago on a 'forbidden planet.' What they find is a robot more advanced than anything imaginable on earth, a beautiful and totally socially inept young woman, and her father, a hermit philologist haunted by more than the demons of the ancient civilization he has immersed himself in.<br /><br />On the surface, this story is a pulp scifi murder mystery. Some compare it to Shakespeare's Tempest, but this is a stretch, and, in some ways, an insult to the scifi genre. Stripped of what makes it a scifi film, sure, its The Tempest, but how many hundreds of films can you say something similar about? <br /><br />Underneath, this is a cautionary tale about progress and technology and the social evolution necessary for its appropriate and safe use. Yet the film still proceeds with all the hopefulness for our future that we have come to expect from shows like Star Trek.<br /><br />Anne Francis is not the only reason why this film is best described as beautiful. The special effects, and even the aesthetics of the backdrops are powerful enough to make the uninspired directing and uneven acting almost unnoticeable. If it were not for the goofy retro-art-deco-ness of 1950s sci-fi props, you might think you were watching a 1960s piece.<br /><br />This is a classic of that very special sub-genre of sci fi I like to call 1950s sci-fi, and, though not, in my opinion, the best it is certainly a must see for anybody interested in sci-fi film and special effects. The clever plot, now rendered trite by its reuse in six or seven episodes of Star Trek, Lost in Space, and even Farscape, is worth paying attention to, and will sustain the interest of most scifi fans. Trekkers will be particularly interested in the various aspects of the film which seem to have inspired themes of Star Trek's original series aired about 12 years later, though they may find themselves disappointed by the (relatively mild) 1950s sexism and the lack of any kind of racial integration. While I do not mean to nitpick, the lack of social progress manifest in this film was the one major problem I had with it. <br /><br />Some will probably see this film simply to catch a glimpse of young, good-looking Leslie Nielsen in one of his first starring roles. Unfortunately, Nielsen's performance is only average, and at times down-right poor (especially at the climax of the film). Walter Pigeon, though quite excellent in other films, over-acts his role as well. Ms Francis, Earl Holliman, and the amazing Robby the Robot are the stand-out actors in this crowd, though on the whole the character actors filling in the ensemble do a good job. The problems with the featured performances, I think, are as much the fault of the director and the editor, as anything. Though they certainly got most of the film quite right.",positive

Very disappointing and boring. The acting was bizarre from the lead. They twisted the story of captain marvel so much I don't even recognize it anymore. They made nick Fury a joke and it's very sad being since he's one of the coolest characters in the MCU. At times the movie shows promise then goes right back to awkward dialogue.,negative
"I've seen this movie quite a few times and each time I watch it, the quirkier and funnier it becomes. Perhaps its the lack of research that went into Nicolas Cage's character's 'punk' persona or just the cheesiness factor because it was such a typical eighties film...nonetheless it's a cute love story with extremely funny, unique characters. I think it's right up there with ""Fast Times"" and ""Weird Science"" (quintessential eighties flicks!)",positive
I was so disappointed!! I think they have the wrong actress. Her acting sucked.  Jokes sucked and it dragged. Samuel L Jackson with the cat and the special effects was the only good thing about this movie. Wouldn't see it again EVER.,negative
"Do-It-Yourself indie horror auteur Todd Sheets returns with another entertainingly atrocious nickel'n'dime shot-on-video clunker that's basically just a feeble excuse to sling around a lot of watery blood and gleaming guts as often as possible. An evil demonic scarecrow resurrects the dead as ravenous rot-faced zombies so they can feast on the living. A bunch of bickering college kids, a trio of dangerous escaped convicts led by the vicious Slade (Byron Nichodemus hamming it up to an outrageous degree), two equally savage sleazeball hoodlums, and a trio of hottie sisters all have to do their best to survive this harrowing ordeal. That's it for the needlessly muddled and convoluted plot, but fortunately what this hilariously horrendous hoot lacks in narrative coherence (plenty) it more than compensates for with a pleasing plethora of gloriously gross'n'graphic gore. Disgusting highlights include a woman having her fingers chopped off, a fatal gunshot to a young gal's groin, attempted necrophiliac rape, evisceration, and, of course, more repulsive entrail eating than you can shake a pile of moist intestines at. Moreover, we've also got rough, grainy cinematography that constantly alternates between washed-out color and grimy black and white, ineptly staged fight scenes, lousy acting from a uniformly pathetic no-name cast (Jerry Angell in particular cops the top crummy thespic dishonors for his laughably abysmal histrionics as slimy no-count psycho criminal Joe Bob), a grating head-banging thrash metal soundtrack, and a generic shivery'n'ominous synthesizer score. Let's not forget the ridiculous ending in which several of our survivors stumble across a few vials of flesh-eating bacteria to use on the shambling undead hordes. Sure, this flick is pure dreck, but it has a certain endearingly abominable quality to it that in turn makes it a great deal of so-awful-it's-awesome Grade Z fun for hardcore aficionados of bad fright fare.",positive
I am a fan of the Nightmare series but this one is horrible. The deaths are so trendy. If you were to watch this 20 years later the whole nintendo scene is outdated. I did like the flashbacks. I think they should have just made a prequel about when he was still alive. That would have been more interesting. This is a movie you can take or leave. Depends on how much spare time you have.,negative

"TLDR: It was ok, not great... not terrible... but was fun. nn1st act was good, 2nd act semi meh, 3rd act awesome. My biggest gripe was the time frame of the the story took place over like 2 days... super rushed for someone to ""discover"" who they are, it felt worse than thor 1 in that sense. nnI get what they were going for, it just came off as too on the nose(lazily written) at times... did we really need a ""misogynist biker"" to tell her to smile more? That felt so shoved in their for no reason other than to make him unlikable so she could steal his bike? nnWonder Woman and Alita did it better, they didn't have to try to be tough, they simply were tough. Also those two characters, and any super hero character to date, had to actually face challenges/sacrifices. nnCaptain marvel sacrificed literally nothing in this movie, made no hard choices, and faced no real danger.. it was ""raaawr  Im badass...oh wait now I'm more badass rawwwr."" nnThe best part of the movie was the last 20mins, and it felt so uneven just to get to that point. Will little girls have another awesome super hero to look up to? yes. Could they have written her a better story to showcase her? absolutely.  All that said the sum of the whole was fun, just felt like it could have easily been a lot better.",controversial

"This would have been my number one movie of the year for 1991, except it got beat out by the brilliant JFK. This is such a wonderful movie! I loved it. I love stories where different characters' lives intersect with others and how deal with their lives. Kevin Kline is good here, but is outshined by Danny Glover and, especially, Steve Martin. I've never much like Martin or his style, but here he is great. I loved the whole speech he gave to Kline near the end about the Grand Canyon. The writing was excellent. Larry Kasdan is, IMO, a great dialogue writer, along the ways of Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino. Here, he has formed several three-dimensional characters and well thought out storylines, and messages that give a positive feel to our lives. A truly excellent film. 4 out of 4 stars",positive
It was an entertaining movie but they took alot of creative liberty. The film seemed rush and instead of it being a feminist movie by her just being a bad ass they decided to keep cramming it down our throat. Lots of plot holes as well. Overall they could have done a much better with this movie. Instead ththeththey took a character who has been rebooted several times in the comicsbecause she just isnt a popular character. This also just seemed like a rush to get a female into the mcu and chose a character that no one wanted black widow would have made a much better stand alone movie.,controversial
"**********POSSIBLE SPOILER********** Madonna plays an ex-con that needs to recover some valuable information that might clear her from the murder that she was put in prison for four years ago. Griffin Dunne is a tax attorney who's marrying his boss' daughter. Together, the two of them are supposed to come together in a world where chaos keeps you from getting on the bus...<br /><br />When you get down to it, this is a stupid movie. Without trying to give away the plot ****POSSIBLE SPOILER****, the bad guys in the movie are trying to protect their boss by retrieving the information that would incriminate them for the murder that Madonna was sent up for. What kind of bad guys don't commit murder by trying to hide the original murder?!?!?!<br /><br />Then there's the cops who are trailing Madonna who follow the bad guys in a limo, where they have the brides-maids all tied up! And let's not forget those same brides-maids who fought from the front gate to the front door, still all tied together! And I hate to say this, but that patagonious feline sure looks like a cougar!

"The title doesn't make much sense to me. I'm not sure what door in the movie shouldn't have been opened.<br /><br />The movie starts uneventfully, with a conversation between a man and a woman in a room that looks like a richly furnished train car, complete with the sound of the train traveling. In fact, the man's house is a train car, and he has a cassette of train sounds. The woman leaves, and calls a young woman. The young woman tells her boyfriend, a doctor, that she's been told her grandmother is ill, and she needs to return to her home town. She hasn't been there in thirteen years.<br /><br />Flash back to thirteen years ago. A shadowy figure enters a house. He caresses a sleeping young girl, then goes into another room and stabs the girl's mother. The girl wakes up and enters her mother's room and finds her dead with a knife in her. She screams, and an arm comes out of nowhere and claps a hand over her mouth. She looks up in fear. That early scene in the movie of the killer muffling her scream, and the girl's look is one of the few effective shots in the movie.<br /><br />It doesn't have much going for it in the visuals department. Occasionally there's some strange use of sound, and there's some weird lighting in an attic scene where many of the panes of glass are red and blue.<br /><br />Back to the present day. The young woman arrives in her grandmother's house. An old doctor is there, who she doesn't trust, along with the man from the opening scene ""Judge"" and Kearn, the town's museum operator. She doesn't trust any of them, and it's true they don't inspire any trust. She's rather crabby throughout the whole movie. She wants to check her grandmother into a hospital. The men in the town want her house, and the museum operator wants the things in it (his museum is already filled with many of the grandmother's things). Inexplicably, the woman wants to keep the house.<br /><br />The young woman starts getting phone calls from a man speaking in a sinister whisper. He makes various threats, and wants her to do things to arouse him. Such scenes recur often. Unfortunately, there are so few characters in the movie, that the possibilities of who it could be are limited. Worse still, we see right from the beginning who is making the phone calls. So, while the young woman doesn't know (even though the caller occasionally drops into his normal voice), the audience always knows: no suspense. Each call rattles her more and more.<br /><br />The ending was unexpected for me, so maybe gets points for not going with the obvious, but I'm not sure I cared for it.",negative

"While I will admit that it was better off than the word has been on the film, it does make for a film where the star isn't that memorable as say wonder woman was. The acting of young Nick Fury and Maria were very well, seeing the changes from young nick to the one we know is a breath of fresh air, heck, even the ""big bads"" had a great performance. But sadly a lot was lost with the acting of Veers/captain marvel/Carol. But the secret to Fury's eyepatch was VERY anticlimactic, which really bummed me out watching in the theater. There were moments that were trying to be funny when it didn't call for it, and moments it did feel a bit too preachy and was pretty bland because of it, or the corny liner from the little girl... I wish I could say the climax was epic, but there just wasn't enough character there to attach to, partly because the whole amnesia thing is pretty lack luster for a main character imo. There wasn't any tension, which is needed. And the irony of the cat garnering more laughter and commotion than the rest of the movie combined...nI have to say it is an average film at best, with some nice things, and a lot of inconsistency. Captain Marvel can bust through solid metal and concrete with ease, but any time she hits a living thing they get thrown a bit, leading to some real disconnect when the movie states she can't control her powers yet so she can't really be able to hit them less... and would lead to a BIG PLOT HOLE... but plot armor...nBut the worst of it all is this could be the last movie with a stan lee cameo, and that saddens me that his final moments in the films could be in an average film like this.",negative
"Giant Robot was the most popular Japanese TV serial ever seen on Indian TV. It was targeted to children and we saw a robot for the first time in our life. <br /><br />Many Indian children must have even seen a machine for the first time outside the school textbooks. <br /><br />The serial also showed a child in an adults organization fighting evil. No doubt, many of us who have seen Giant Robot in our childhood long for our own robots and as a stopgap arrangement look upon our computers in the same way. <br /><br />This show also portrayed ideal adults, (referring at Jerry, Johnny's buddy friend and Unicorn chief Azuma). We grew to respect Japanese progress and still view Japan as the ideal Asian nation.<br /><br />BTW, at that time, there were no satellite TV channels in India and the govt owned broadcaster did not show much of Disney cartoons. I guess that was how child serials like giant Robot got appreciated. Nowadays there is Pokemon etc but they are no so fascinating or alluring as Giant robot.",positive

"You don't need to read this review.<br /><br />An earlier review, by pninson of Seattle, has already identified all the main shortcomings of this production. I can only amplify its basic arguments.<br /><br />Bleak House was a relatively late Dickens novel and is much darker than his earlier work. This is taken too literally by the director, Ross Devenish, who piles on the gloom and fog too much. When Ada, Rick and Esther appear, half an hour into the opening episode, it is a relief just to be in daylight for the first time. In some of the murkier scenes it was hard to see what was actually on my TV screen. I watched the whole thing in one day, starting in mid-afternoon. As daylight faded this became less of an issue, but I have a pretty good TV and I have never encountered this problem before at any time of day.<br /><br />The pacing is very deliberate (i.e. slow). I am sure this was intensional, but it is overdone. There are numerous shots of people trudging though the muck and gloom of Victorian London that are held longer than is necessary to establish the mood and atmosphere. A good editor could probably take several minutes out of each fifty-minute episode, without losing a line of dialogue, just by trimming each of these scenes slightly.<br /><br />I don't want to overstate these two problems. You soon adjust to the look and pace of this production. The more important issue is that it doesn't always tell the story very effectively. Earlier Dickens novels are as long as Bleak House, but are not nearly so intricately plotted. For example, I recently re-read Nicholas Nickleby because I was intrigued to see how Douglas McGrath crammed an 800 page book into his two-hour movie. The answer is simple: the book is full of padding. McGrath cut great swathes of the novel while still retaining all the essential story elements. This would not be possible with Bleak House. <br /><br />This production needs its seven hours. Probably, it needs even longer, because many elements of its convoluted plot are not sufficiently clear, or as well handled, as they need to be. A few random examples will illustrate the problems.<br /><br />The maid, Rosa, appears from nowhere with no background, so Lady Dedlock's attachment to her is largely unmotivated.<br /><br />Sergeant George's acquiescence in Tulkinhorn's demand for a sample of Horton's handwriting is somewhat fudged.<br /><br />It is not made clear enough that Esther is actually in love with Woodcourt when she agrees to marry John Jarndyce. Neither is it clear that they have agreed not to announce their engagement, or why.<br /><br />Ada and Rick's secret marriage is omitted. In one episode they are merely lovers, in the next, people are suddenly referring to them as husband and wife.<br /><br />Mrs Rouncewell is only introduced at a late stage in the story and Sargeant George's estrangement from his family is left unexplained - as is the means by which she is discovered.<br /><br />Tulkinhorn's dedication to maintaining the honour and respectability of the Dedlock family is understated, so his motive for persecuting Lady Dedlock is more obscure than it need be.<br /><br />The involvement of the brick makers with both Tom and (later) Lady Dedlock is somewhat opaque.<br /><br />It is not obvious that Guppy renews his offer to Esther because her smallpox scars have all but vanished.<br /><br />This is only a selection: there are others. They are not major problems and the main thrust of the story is clear enough. Nonetheless, they are minor irritations that detract from its power: you shouldn't have to puzzle over little plot points. However, there are more important structural problems that do weaken the story in its later stages.<br /><br />The whole business of Tulkinhorn's murder is somewhat thrown away. Bucket immediately pinpoints Hortense as a suspect, which undermines the suspense of Sergeant George's predicament and the importance of finding Mrs Rouncewell. It also diminishes the impact of the sub-plot in which suspicion is thrown on Lady Dedlock and weakens the scene in which Hortense is unmasked in front of Sir Lester.<br /><br />A more serious problem is that the murder, its investigation and the subsequent search for Lady Dedlock, dominate the story for over an hour, during which time we completely lose sight of the other main plot strand: the legal case and its effect on Rick. His failing finances, his gouging by Vholes and Skimpole, Ada's despair, his declining health and so on, are all put on hold for an entire episode. This may be how Dickens wrote the book (I haven't read it for years) but a good screenplay should keep the different plot strands moving forward together.<br /><br />Finally, Smallweed's role in the story is so diminished that he is almost superfluous. His discovery of the new will, that triggers the final phase of the story, is also thrown away. It happens off screen.<br /><br />Despite all of this, it is still a very good production. Many of the performances are outstanding. Individual scenes are beautifully realised. Its accumulating sense of tragedy is very powerful. I would still be recommending it as a superb adaptation of a great book, had it not been for the 2005 production. In fact, I probably wouldn't be fully aware of its defects if I hadn't seen how Andrew Davies did it better. I have been critical of Davies's Jane Austen adaptations, but I have to admit that he really knows how to tame Dickens's sprawling books.<br /><br />This is an impressive and gripping drama and well worth seven hours of anybody's time. Nonetheless, its probable fate is to be viewed mainly as a cross-reference to the near-definitive 2005 version.",positive

"This was not the worst MCU film in the series, but it is definitely in the bottom of the MCU films. The film did very little to flesh out many of the characters including the hero, Captain Marvel.

Spoiler: Captain Marvel gets her powers from a glowing blue battery that somehow gives her powers beyond that of even Thor while simultaneously causing her to lose her memories. The dumbest part of the movie is when Captain Marvel gets her full abilities. Near the end of the film, Captain Marvel finally unlocks her full power by removing a dampener that has been on her neck the entire film. I was thinking why didn't she take that off earlier?

"Biggest biff with the film? Trying to bank off of the recent retro hype. Ready Player One, Bumblebee, Thor Ragnarok, Stranger Things, and possibly the starter of the trend in Guardaians of the Galaxy all took things that some of us grew up with and molded them into the film so that not only were they a story about a hero, but a story created from the hearts of our nostalgia. It's why all of those movies have been such hits and it's why this film seems so flat. Yay, she had knee ripped out jeans and fell through a Blockbuster, good job capturing the essence of the nineties. Also, where has Captain Marvel been for the past 30 years? I guess only when half of the Earth's population is gone does it warrant a true emergency for the Superman of the Marvel Universe (because in DC they call him in even when toast gets too crispy...) Carol Danvers (not Kara Danvers [Supergirl] of course) skips the whole learn your powers tutorial and goes straight into kicking Ronan the Accuser's fleet around like beach balls and being essentially Superman. Never have been a fan of the Man of Steel because other than his famous weakness he really isn't relatable. In Captain America we see that he cherishes his strength because he once was weak, in Iron Man we see a snob using his money for something pseudo good (his intentions are often wrong, so Kant would say he isn't really a hero, so I'm not really a fan of him either anymore) Thor has lost his powers multiple times due to selfishness and had to learn to be selfless and work with others, and the list goes on, but Carol's main thing is that she used to fall down a lot (copied from Batman much?). One of the failings of the Justice League film is that the moment Superman is revived Steppenwolf is kicked around like a new whelping puppy. To introduce Captain Marvel like this is really lazy writing and it would have been much better if she was a new and up-and-coming hero like Spider-Man because then the plot holes of her never being around wouldn't be present. Either way, her character is kinda boring, and the film itself is a more entertaining version of Green Lantern (even borrowed the original color scheme...) Really the only thing that saves it from being horrible is Goose and Fury and wanting to see Avengers. This is our desperate grab for some solace after the amazing ending given in Infinity War, and it really comes up short. I can't say I didn't like it, but it's one of the lesser entries in the MCU.",negative

"Some guys think that sniper is not good because of the action part of it was not good enough. Well, if you regard it as an action movie, this view point could be quite true as the action part of this movive is not actually exciting. However, I think this is a psychological drama rather than an action one.<br /><br />The movie mainly told us about the inside of two snipers who definitely had different personalities and different experiences. Tomas Beccket , who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed kills, looked as if he was cold-hearted. However, after Beccket showed his day dream of Montana, we can clearly see his softness inside. It was the cruel war and his partners' sacrifice that made Beccket become so called cold-hearted.<br /><br />Millar, on the contrary, was a new comer, a green hand, and was even not qualified as a sniper. Billy Zane did quite well to show millar's hesitation and fear when he first tried to ""put a bullet through one's heart""(as what Beccket said). What he thought about the actuall suicide mission was that it could be easily accomplished and then he could safely get back and receive the award.<br /><br />These two guys were quite different in their personalities and I think that the movie had successfully showed the difference and the impact they had to each other due to the difference in their personalities. These two snipers quarreled, suspected each other and finally come to an understanding by the communication and by what they had done to help even to save the other.<br /><br />Sniper isn't a good action movie but a good psychological one.",positive

"After hearing some online complaints I went in to this being completely unbiased and hoping for the best. What I got was a good movie that was overall enjoyable. It's not the best, but certainly not the worst. Beats the crap out of Iron Man 3. But yes, Captain Marvel needs a LITTLE editing. Carol's old sidekick is good, but then mouths off at an alien (that she should have been shocked at the sight of) in a forced ""PC"" statement. Her daughter is also one of those annoying fake kids, would have liked her to be a more realistic character. It has a few things in it to intentionally annoy men and cater to women, like when they scan Fury and say he's a human male and therefor completely harmless. Would they scan Black Widow and make the equivalent insult? Of course not. So this movie has asked for some of this type of criticism so it really shouldn't complain about it. I don't want to only point out the negative, but Carol is also very overpowered at the end. She can probably start Endgame by flying up to Thanos, picking him up by the back of his neck, and flying him out of the universe. I'm interested to see how they tone down her powers a bit. But those complaints aside, the movie flows well, no real slow parts, and kept my interest until the end. Brie Larson's has been criticized as miscast but I don't think so. I liked her and I think she acted the part in the way a person would act who has been through the ordeal she lived through. I'm torn between 2.5 and 3 stars because of the high standard I expect from a MCU movie, especially after Infinity War. I'm going with 3 so that Rotten Tomatoes doesn't delete my review (probably paid off by Disney). I would watch this movie again and not be bored. I can't say that about Black Panther and that was nominated for best picture so that also puts me at the solid 3 star mark. Glad I went, you probably will be as well.",positive

"Watchable and fun but one of the lower tier of the mcu movies. Bland direction is helped by a strong supporting cast. Brie Larson has a hard task to breathe life into what is basically a blank slate. She does fine but I can see her improving down the line as by the end there is a full character to work with. Not much there starting off. I'd put it on par with mcu origin films Thor and Cap America, bit shaky and finding their feet but they get there as it continues. I think the same will be true here.",negative

"No where near as good as other Marvel movies. But still a good movie. Story was interesting, and seeing Nick Fury in his early stages was interesting. And this is the part where people will call me a sexist hater, Brie Larson didn't do a good enough of a job pulling off the part. Not sure if that's on her, or the Director.

"Its not a bad movie but its nowhere near the best. To me I didn't really see a real conflict in the story, like the stakes didn't seem very high. Captain Marvel's origin story is pretty unique and I like how they did the whole regaining your memory back thing but her character arc in the story was nonexistent. Her character arc was starting off as a super powerful person to ending as a super powerful person but now helping some aliens find a home. nThe whole twist of the good guys are actually the bad guys was an interesting concept but it was just so predictable, like when my mom first watched it in the first 15 minutes she already knew that the twist was coming.nAlso I feel like Captain Marvel's character isn't that likable. She is extremely powerful and basically has no weakness, she's over confident (which could work for some characters) but her humor isn't funny. The over confidence thing could've gone well if she always fails at something but she doesn't, she wins EVERYTHING, which makes her seem like a cocky asshole with a snarky attitude.nAlso I genuinely feel like she shouldn't have been added to the MCU because she doesn't bring anything knew, she's kind of just there. AND, she's so powerful that now at this point most regular bad guys could be defeated by her with a single punch, like the only person who was able to stop her was Thanos when he wielded all 6 infinity stones basically making a literal god, anything weaker she can just stick out her fist and blast them out of existence (which isn't that fun to watch if they have literally no other weaknesses).nI think the writers saw that we wanted a strong female superhero but they only inputted the strong bad ass side of it and not the human side of it.",negative
"I am a lover of bad movies. I own ""R.O.T.O.R."" and ""Boa vs. Python"" and am working to build up my collection to such great titles as ""Troll 2"" and ""What's up Superdoc?"" But ""Storm Trooper"" is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies. It's just lame. The guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right. Everything about this movie is stupid. When the robot guy runs into the car it seems almost as if he knew it was going to blow up, there was just no reason he would ever run in that direction. ""Judge, Jury, and Executioner,"" ""The perfect cop...but they went too far,"" I mean, come on, why do people bother making these movies anymore? R.O.T.O.R. makes it because it is hysterically awful, but Storm Trooper is just a waste of cinema because it isn't even bad enough to be so bad it's worth watching. This belongs in someone's home movies collection, something they can be sort of proud of, but that is all.

"This was a very good movie that I honestly enjoyed watching if it weren't for Brie Larson. She was very boring, and the whole scene about her blasting her former mentor with her powers compleatly dissagreed with the common marvel concept of not needing your powers to be a good hero. This is displayed in countless films and is even the main point of many films like Iron man 1&3, Spiderman homecoming, Black Panther, and Thor Ragnarok. Instead, Brie larson's arrogant and stoic character displayed the message that one should use one's abilities as a crutch to get things done. I have no problem with anyone else in the cast and loved the amazing CGI efects but the first thing I thought of when the movie was over, was ""wow Brie Larson was horrible in this"" . I generally like Brie Larson in her films, but I don't think she was the right choice for the lead and it costed marvel a chance to establish a strong female lead. Now all they have is an arrogant one. I hope this review doesn't get taken down like the rest of them.",positive

"Poor Ivy: Though to the manner born, she had the bad luck to marry a charming wastrel (Richard Ney). As the movie is set in the 20s or 30s, when rigid Victorian ideas of class were starting to fray at the edges, this uncertain status vexes her unduly. The Gretorexes (for so they are called) don't know where their next shilling is coming from but there are yachting parties and fancy-dress balls in posh pleasaunces aplenty to tempt her. When Ivy (Joan Fontaine) makes the acquaintance of a wealthy older gent (Herbert Marshall, who must have been born middle-aged), she sets one of her extravant chapeaux for him. Luckily, one of the beaux she still strings along (Patric Knowles) is a physician whose consulting rooms provide a cache of poison, with which she bids her hubby farewell. The fact that it implicates Knowles doesn't phase her a bit, even as the hours trickle by until he should be hanged by the neck until dead. The turning of the plot depends on police inspector Sir Cedric Hardwicke; Knowles' mother (the redoubtable Lucile Watson); and Knowles' loyal housekeeper (Una O'Connor). Sam Wood adds some subtle touches to this well above average melodrama; Fontaine's luminous face supplies the rest.",positive
"I had completely forgotten about ""Midnight Madness"" until just now when I found it while surfing the IMDB. Now, it's all coming back to me....<br /><br />It was one of Naughton's first movies (as well as Fox's) and sharp-eyed connoisseurs will also pick out Kaplan (Henry from TV's ""Alice""), Fiedler (he does the voice of Piglet in the ""Winnie the Pooh"" cartoons) and Blocker (son of Dan ""Hoss"" Blocker from TV's ""Bonanza"").<br /><br />But the two that stand out in my mind are Furst (from ""Animal House"") and the superdude himself - Eddie Deezen. Furst plays a baddie this time out and has one of the best scenes when he asks his dad, ""Why can't you just accept me for who I am?"" His dad looks over his obese, slovenly frame and gives a simple, one-word response - ""Yuck!""<br /><br />And Deezen... well, he's a show in himself. As a latter-day Jerry Lewis he stumbles around, wades through mini-golf ponds, puts melon halves on his ears and ends up having Maggie Roswell fall for him. My hero.<br /><br />As for the film, it's typical early-'80s stupidity with college kids staying up after curfew and going on a city-wide scavenger hunt to prove which division of students is the best on campus: the jocks, the nerds, the rich kids, the feminists or the group made up of a little of each. <br /><br />Who wins?

The new resistance leader with the purple hair wasn't very interesting. It also has a slow start and the overall story about trying to escape from imperial ships was a bit pointless. Still, despite all of those criticisms I had a really great time watching it. There really are some fantastic moments and I appreciate the fact that this movie was clearly made for the fans.

This film is more like Dark Water, except it is even more predictable and slow moving than it. I was extremely disappointed with this film. It didn't scare me nor interest me either. Let's face it , this type of plot has been flogged to death at this stage e.g. the dead trying to contact the living - Dragonfly, What Lies Beneath, Ghost Story, Dark Water, Darkness, The Changeling etc.etc. It seems to me that the only ones writing original horror films nowadays are the Japanese and the Koreans.

There also posed no threat in the fight scenes after Carol took away her chip in her neck and just destroyed everything almost as easy as Thanos snapping his fingers.

"""A Minute to Pray, A Second to Die"" is a quality spaghetti western with a solid cast and an interesting storyline. It is filmed beautifully, with a relatively high production value for a film in this genre.<br /><br />Alex Cord does a terrific job portraying Clay McCord, an outlaw who is suffering from increasingly debilitating seizures. He is seeking amnesty before his enemies close in on him, but is being too cocky for his own good when he asks for it. Robert Ryan delivers the best performance in the film as the governor of New Mexico. Mario Brega and Arthur Kennedy are also great here.<br /><br />This movie is very good, but it doesn't stand out to me as being one of the best spaghetti westerns out there. It's lacking too much in style to be in the same league as any of the great ones. It does have some cool spaghetti overtones, but overall it's a bit too much like an American western. This is especially evident in the music score, which is OK as movies go in general, but pretty dull by euro-western standards. The soundtrack kind of reminds me of the music from ""The Unforgiven."" Although there is an interesting story here, it is told in a manner which is a bit too conventional for my tastes. If a spaghetti western fan and a Hollywood western fan had to watch a movie together, this one would be the perfect compromise.<br /><br />All of this is not to say that anyone should avoid this film.

Like-able supporting cast with a strong villain and a fun look at early 90's shield in a pre-avengers world. Very pleased with the way Skrulls have been implemented into the cosmic MCU. Feminist message was inspiring but could've blended in better and Larson was clearly invested in executing that vision at the cost of character depth beyond the content of the script. Plot twists hardly impacted the expected course of the story. Overall lost the 4 star cuz the trailer gave away the whole story. ,controversial
"From actor and independent writer/director John Cassavetes, A Woman Under the Influence gives the viewer a look at a working class family with a problem of mental instability. The husband, Nick (played by Peter Falk) is a blue collar worker who has trouble showing his wife, Mabel (played by Gena Rowlands) the amount of attention that she deserves. From the onset of the film, it is obvious that Mabel is very quirky and strange, but only a few minutes later it is clear that she is much more than that. Crazy. Bonkers. Out of her damn mind. Nick tries his hardest to hide this from his co-workers, and after she has a particularly strange incident at dinner, he asks her if she'll be okay, as if he's trying to deny Mabel's illness. Her problem only spirals from there.<br /><br />I did find some particular problems with this film. I guess these problems were mostly present in the story, and the way some of the character acted toward the end. Mabel has been committed, because, frankly, she's nuts. Then, six months later, she's ready to come out of the hospital, and her husband throws a party to welcome her back. He never acts stupid in the beginning of the movie. Why would he invite all these people, some of them strangers to Mabel, over to his house when his wife is in such a fragile state? It's simply idiotic. Later, after Mabel comes in the house, Mabel's father has a huge outburst at Nick, screaming at the top of his lungs about not wanting to eat spaghetti. His daughter has just gotten back from six months of rehabilitation, and the thing you want to do is keep her calm, and he goes nuts over spaghetti? A few minutes later in the film, Nick brings Mabel into the stairwell and forces her to do the things she did when she was mentally unstable; make her weird noises and gestures. Didn't he send her there to make her better and not do those things? There were various other parts that occurred after this, but it would just be redundant to look at them in more detail. I guess I just had a serious problem with the decision by Cassavetes to have his characters act in this way. It simply didn't make sense.<br /><br />However, although I had problems with the ending of the film, there was one aspect that really redeemed it; the acting. Gena Rowlands played an amazing crazy woman. There were times when I forgot she was acting, where I got so caught up in her wild gesticulations and crazy talk that I was actually scared of her. She was amazingly convincing and intense. However, I was also impressed by the rest of Mabel's family. Peter Falk played a very strange character, and I almost thought he was crazy himself, because of the awkward way he handled his children, his job, and especially the situation with his wife. I also usually don't appreciate child actors. But the young people who played Nick and Mabel's children in this film were phenomenal. It really felt like they were Mabel's children, because they seemed so attached to her and were so interesting in helping her with her problem. I think their performances are one of the things that kept this film together, and without them it would have made the film less realistic and less intense.<br /><br />In general I wasn't impressed by this film. The story was jumbled and unclear, and the characters acted in ways that made me wonder who wasn't insane in the movie. The only saving grace were brilliant lead acting roles of the Longhetti family. Their realistic dialogue and powerful acting kept the film together, and are probably the only reason the film has ever amounted to anything.",negative

"This movie was so poorly written and directed I fell asleep 30 minutes through the movie. The jokes in the movie are corny and even though the plot is interesting at some angles, it is too far fetched and at some points- ridiculous. If you are 11 or older you will overlook the writing in the movie and be disappointed, but if you are 10 or younger this is a film that will capture your attention and be amazed with all the stunts (which I might add are poorly done) and wish you were some warrior to. The casting in this movie wasn't very good, and the music was very disappointing because it was like they were trying to build up the tension but it didn't fit at all. On a scale of 1-10 (10 being excellent, 1 being horrible) the acting in this movie is a 4. Brenda Song is talented in comedy, but with this kind of movie, in some of the more serious scenes, her acting was laughable. When she made some of her ""fighting"" poses, I started laughing out loud. I think the worst thing about this movie is definitely the directing, for example, the part where her enemy turns out to be the person the evil villain is possesing, how her voice turns dark and evil, I think that was incredibly stupid, and how Wendy's (Brenda Song)teachers were all her teachers at school being possessed by monks, that was pretty ridiculous to. So to sumamrize it all, a disappointing movie, but okay if you're 10 or under.",negative
"The Force Awakens may me feel giddy like a 10 year old child watching Star Wars again. This movie made me feel sad and confused... Rian Johnson made such a focused effort to subvert your expectations that you become numb to the random ""GOTCHA"" moments throughout this film. Conflict is created for the sake of conflict, and characters are beat down contrary to their established arcs just to elevate other characters. I love Rey, I love Jyn (I love strong women in general, Sarah Conner for example) but Holdo and Rose were horrible characters that were forced in to make a political point. It was either telling the audience that Poe is a moron hot shot loser, or that saving space horses is more important than the mission. This movie has criticisms of capitalism... the same capitalism that allowed Disney to buy a monopoly of the entertainment system... the same system that makes them billions of dollars per year. I don't need to be preached at in my Star Wars, I need to escape to a Galaxy Far Far Away. Summary:",controversial

"This movie is a cringe-fest of bad acting and poor set design as well as tacky lines and a lame plot. But it is so much fun to watch. Everything about it is hilarious.The basic plot is a group of scientists from the future travel back in time to capture their evil co-worker who is intent on destroying them all. They catch up with him in the year 1146. The 'futuristic' lab of the scientists from the year 2033 is an eighties-style room with a bunch of 'futuristic' flashing buttons and a time capsule that looks like a lawn shed. The actors deliver their lines with unenthusiastic aplomb, which isn't hard to understand considering that the lines are usually earth-shakers like "" I double-checked everything twice!"" He double checked everything twice? He checked it four times? Not only that, but they feed you the entire premise of the movie in the first five minutes, and continue at a rapid fire pace until they hit the medieval part. When Roger Corman ran out of money. And had to stop travelling through time and consequently different sets. The medieval set is a comic mish-mash of anything from the late 10th century to the 16th century. Any costume they could find, they used. I guess chain mail wasn't on the budget, 'cause the guys all wear sequined shirts masquerading as armor. The fight scenes are laughable, with men casually throwing themselves onto cardboard swords with abandon and dying in death throws with nary a blow cast.It sounds truly awful, but I enjoy it every time I watch it. The lines alone are enough to have you in fits and everything else pulls together to create a fabulous B-movie that, if you are a connoisseur of corny flicks, I would suggest you see. And once you have, read the review on Unknown Movies. I love hearing them point out all the funny, truly awful bits in the movie.",negative

"Enjoyable enough. She is a great character for little girls and there is nothing wrong with that at all. Brie Larson may not be the grinning hero people expect but I liked her attitude, wit, and sarcasm. The play between her and Sam Jackson almost had a Lethal Weapon-type vibe to it which was great to see. The first 3/4 of the film was definitely the strongest and I enjoyed seeing the two of them on the hunt for answers. On the downside, they could have left the man-hate jokes out of it. I get it's cool and trendy to hate men now but the Nick Fury â€śHuman Male Threat Zero to Noneâ€ť was actually pretty insulting and too on the nose (they DO realize half the audience is in fact both human and male?). There were a couple other parts like that but easy enough to ignore and just enjoy the movie (sticks and stones, right?). Villains were confusing, didn't really understand their motivation in the end. Plot, themes, and even the characters were VERY similar to Green Lantern...felt like I had seen the movie before. Hell even the costumes looked very close. In the end I would say I enjoyed it as much as the other Marvel films...it was a good popcorn flick but suffers from shoehorning political statements of our time, and that will probably become more apparent in this film as it ages. Should leave those sort of statements to The X-Men, they are more suited for such themes. Still, grab your daughter/niece/sister/mother or whoever and take them to see it, then maybe they will see why we all loved action comic heroes growing up. Looking forward to Endgame. ",positive

"Unlike other Marvel films this one seemed to drag for the first hour of the movie. The comedy seemed a bit out of place and the dialogue was a bit wooden at times.nnObviously Sam Jackson did a great job, and the de-aging they did for him was incredible, but it also felt like that's where most of the CGI budget went. Other effects in this movie felt stock and at most times I felt like I was watching a cut scene from a PS3 game.nnThe film had too many plot lines for an origin story and when the film didn't feel bland it felt over saturated and Marvel never got a rhythm down feeling uneven throughout. The only thing that felt even was Carol Danvers arc and by even I mean flat. Mendelson was probably the best thing in this movie and if you're a huge fan of his work he does shine here as well.nnLastly and I won't spoil it but Nick Fury losing his eye was quite possibly the dumbest thing I have seen in a Marvel movie since the Manderin reveal in Iron Man 3. Worse actually, because this Easter eggs effects the way I look at the character Nick Fury in all the previous films in a negative way.nnAll in all 2 out of 5 Ă˘Â­?for me.

"""Mame"" is a disgrace to many things--to Lucille Ball, to a story which has been told better many times over, and to the musical genre altogether.

The production is very shoddy and cheap looking, the songs are sub-par, and nearly every joke misfires. Also, Lucy couldn't dance well, so the music had to be slowed down to a funerial pace.

"I went into this movie with low expectations of an obnoxious feminist narrative and a plain, Mary-sue type of a once great female character. I ended up loving it and falling in love with the big screen version of Carol Danvers. Though the movie has its flaws like it's two obnoxious, but forgettable and irrelevant feminist scenes that prove how out of touch Hollywood seems to be and some pretty rough line delivery, the rest of the movie pulls through. Unlike the Mary-Sue reputation Ms.Danvers was given before her debut, she has flaws and her story arc is about regaining what makes her human, embracing flaws, and using it to power who she really is. She is truly a strong woman who deals with a challenging battle in her story arc. She was relatable, she was cool, and Brie Larson really brought her to life. As far a marvel movie goes the plot twist was the best in many marvel movies to be completely honest and I fell in love with the soundtrack. The nostalgia wasn't overplayed at all. It was just enough to let the viewer jam out to Nirvana, but not cringe at a million unnecessary 90s references like some recent overboard-on-nostalgia movies. Also the fight scenes were well cut and almost reminiscent of Umbrella Academy in the way the music fits with the scene and really doesn't feel like an afterthought. To be completely honest this is my favorite marvel movie since Thor 3 and I'm really glad Marvel didn't use the opportunity to go overboard on narratives and nostalgia and deliver us a real character, with a great story and story at.

"I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed this most thoughtfully delivered drama, which owing to its rather unimpressive 6.6 rating, I nearly missed; as I rarely give the time of day to any movie rated below 7/10. Having said that, I'm so glad I gave Stone Angel the viewing it so very much deserved. And so should you, if you are one of the increasingly rare sensitive, soulful and thoughtful sorts of person left on this earth in living form.<br /><br />I must say that in many ways (though not all), viz. its themes, execution, style, production etc., Stone Angel very much reminded me of the much praised ""The Notebook"". I am so surprised that other commentators didn't pick up on the many similarities which repeatedly struck me throughout this movie, so I can only assume that those who've written comments have yet to see the Notebook. They may not share any Alzheimer's theme, yet I can confidently say that if you very much enjoyed ""The Notebook"" you will certainly find much to engage your time most fruitfully with ""The Stone Angel"". But even If you've not seen The Notebook, nor read the book on which this move is based, (which, incidentally, I haven't either) you should definitely find much to hold your attention firmly - as long as your favourite genres don't include fast paced action thrillers. This is a movie for thinkers and those who like to reminisce about time's passing, how life changes as the years pass, and what might have happened in one's life as one gazes back through the years.<br /><br />This bizarrely underrated yet great movie really deserves a rating of approximately 8/10. I can only blame its current lowish rating of 6.6/10 on the 11% of idiots who gave it 1/10. After all it has attracted less than 300 votes at the time of my writing this comment. Nonetheless, if those 11% who gave it the lowest ranking possible were really expecting car chases and explosions why didn't they look... for even a few seconds at the movie's premise and promotional lines?

Ralph Morgan, (Raymond Wrede/Archer's Secretary) gave a great supporting role and was the brother to Frank Morgan who appeared ""In the Wizard of Oz"" 1939. Eugene Palette, (Detective Sgt.

"From the excellent acting of an extremely impressive cast, to the intelligently written (and very quotable) script, from the lavish cinematography to the beautiful music score by Carter Burwell, Rob Roy offers a rarity in movie going experiences: one that is nigh impossible to find fault with in any area.<br /><br />There have been several comparisons made with Braveheart, which came out the same year. With all due credit to Mel Gibson, Braveheart struck me as too much of a self-conscious and preachy epic to rival Rob Roy as the kind of movie I would care to see more than once. While Braveheart works hard to be a serious epic, Rob Roy just grabs you and absorbs you into its tightly edited storytelling. Not a single scene is wasted.<br /><br />Rob Roy contains the perfect balance of dramatic tension, action and even occasional humor. The characters are well fleshed-out, perfectly conveying vernacular and mannerisms that anchor them in their authentic period setting.<br /><br />Further, they are not caricatures of good and evil as we all too often observe in even modern film.<br /><br />For example, while we hope the heroic Rob Roy prevails, we realize his predicaments are products of his own pride and sense of honor. Tim Roth plays one of the most hateful bad guys in the history of cinema, yet there are moments when we can understand how the events of his life have shaped him into becoming what he is. Rob Roy employs a level of character development that makes its story even more believable and gripping.<br /><br />Rob Roy is a delightful treasure, featuring one of the greatest sword fights ever choreographed and a climatic ending worthy of all the tense anticipation.",positive

"My Issue with Captain Marvel comes from a bias love of the comic books. The movie itself is ok. despite some of its plot inconsistencies. In this incarnation, Mar-Vel is a woman, who instead of bestowing Carol with Cosmic power, instructs her to destroy a device she created which then pseudo-science sideways grants her cosmic abilities. This feels like an extra long episode of agents of shield more than an actual marvel movie. The colors are dulled out, costumes look Power Rangers grade, while at the same time the story they tell is OK. I do feel like it would have been a much more interesting story to see Carol and Nick Fury do a fish out of water buddy comedy adventure vs the Skrulls, but that's not what happens here. The feminism points are pushed HEAVY in this almost to the point of being too obtuse. Something it's comparison movie, Wonder Woman does not do and was much more successful for it. There is a literal scene where she is being cat called by a motor cyclist, who she ignores, and then robs after shoplifting an outfit from a clothing store, leaving the camera to focus in on an exposed pair of breasts... this literally happens in a Marvel film..  a real feminist, Margaret Thatcher said it best ""Power is like being a lady... if you have to tell people you are, you aren't."" The ending scene is cool, but you literally have seen it all if you've watched the trailer.. and If you were expecting Ronan the Accuser to actually show how cool he is I advise you to expect nothing.

"I'm the sort of person who went down to the local library and read books on Babbage's difference engine whilst my schoolmates were playing football etc.. So, if there is any such thing as a target audience for this film, then I guess I'd probably be included in that.<br /><br />Maybe I just need to watch it again. A previous reviewer mentioned not to watch this film whilst being tired. Maybe that was my mistake.<br /><br />I tried my best to enjoy this film, and there are aspects of it that I do like, but overall I found it amateurish and quite plodding.<br /><br />Being somewhat of a self confessed computer nerd, I just can't help but pick up on the exact time frame when the movie was actually made, and how the employed graphics reflect that time (i.e. 1997). Having played games of the era c.f. ""Mind Grind"" to cite one example, this film cannot escape that 16-bit colour low res multimedia explosion of that time. Now thankfully this has somewhat lessened in more recent years in the gaming world at least, in favour of actual game play.<br /><br />Having to resort to watching this movie via a German FTA satellite channel (as I don't think it's ever been aired on UK FTA TV, well not recently anyway), I was mildly amused to see the end credits note Gottdog (God dog) had 4 people working on it's design. Maybe it's mean spirited of me to be amused by this, given that ten years have elapsed since the movie was made, nevertheless the end result makes movie graphics from the eighties look good by comparison.<br /><br />But, as for the main story, I agree that the format isn't the best idea. Like others I agree that Ada deserves a film without the sci-fi angle, and a more straightforward biographical approach would perhaps be better suited to covering the life story of this remarkable lady.<br /><br />There are fundamental mistakes that undermine my enjoyment of this movie. First of all the underlying idea that somehow lost real-world information from the past can be accurately reconstructed through some sort of extrapolation via software based intelligent agents, seems somehow ludicrous.<br /><br />Also, the theme running through the movie that a computing device can indeed predict the mechanics of all things through the course of time (e.g. the winds) is now known not to be the case.<br /><br />OK, so the Victorians may have held this view, but the 20th century works of Gödel proving that no mathematical system can be complete, Turing's works on the limits of computability, not to mention chaos theory and quantum mechanics, have all completely undermined these ideas, which seem central to how the modern day researcher's software is supposed to work.<br /><br />Finally, the clicking of the mouse in the air to mean ""programming"" is also just plain wrong, as previously mentioned.<br /><br />This film maybe could have been OK, but at least some technical and scientific consultation would have given the film some much needed credit in the believability stakes.<br /><br />I won't forget the film though, as like ""Pi"", it is clearly a unique work, but with too many fatal mistakes for me to truly enjoy it, 3/10 from me.",negative
"My name is John Mourby and this is my story about Paperhouse: In May 2003 I saw Alfred Hitchcock's psycho, I was very scared and deeply disturbed. I began a frantic search for a film that was frightening in the same way. But none where satisfactory. Amongst those tried and failed were The Birds, Night of the Living Dead, The Silence of the Lambs, The Blair Witch Project, Ring, The Evil Dead, The Sixth Sense, 28 Days Later, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, Near Dark, Alien, Peeping Tom, The Cell, Rosemary's Baby, Don't Look Now, Witchfinder General, Friday the 13th and The Omen. That should confirm I was desperate! Long after I had stopped searching I found out about Paperhouse .<br /><br />Paperhouse is based on a favourite book that I own, called Marianne Dreams. Paperhouse had also come up in some of the books I had found on horror films, but they didn't tell me about the link between book and film. I discovered the truth while on the Internet, I bought the film later that day.<br /><br />I thought Paperhouse would not be faithful to the book and dull. Unfaithal it certainly was but dull certainly not. It was the answer to my prayers Marianne is renamed Anna in the film but most of the original story is the same. One day in school Anna draws a house in her scrap book (nothing remarkable about that) then she becomes ill and every time she faints or falls asleep she finds herself outside a creepy old house (and I mean genuinely unnerving). More she also finds that every time she puts something new in the drawing it appears in the dreamworld, EG an apple tree. Anna draws into the dreamworld a rather sad boy named mark who apparently is a person in the real world. Mark is a cripple but wants to leave the house, obligingly Anna draws in a lighthouse (a place to go to) but still the problem remains mark can't walk. So Anna decides to draw her father in. she gets her pencil out and gets too work, but the outcome is deformed and unsettling Anna particularly dislikes his eyes. Quote ""he looks like madman"". So Anna tries to rub him out and start again, but the pencil proves indelible (that means nothing can be rubbed out). Then Anna loses her temper and crosses out her father's eyes! I leave you too find out for you self the terrible consequences of the rash action.<br /><br />Paperhouse truly is the British answer to A Nightmare on elm Street! The viewing of this film left me shocked and upset. But I have found what I was looking for after 2 years. The question is how dose the compare with Psycho? Answer, 1 the old dark house, 2 psychological parental fears, 3 a genuine shock, 4 and very scary music.",positive

"I saw this series in 1999 in London TV and was blown away. Like another user commented - This is what i would have liked to see when i first watched ""Jurassic Park"" - Life and death of Dinosaurs in their natural habitat as a documentary. The CG are very lifelike, and the diversity of dinosaurs and habitats shown makes it also very educational.<br /><br />The series takes everything factually known about dinosaurs, adds a lot of good ideas on ""what it could have been"" to make up what then looks like a documentary series. What i missed was some small bar-graph constantly in one corner of the screen, moving between ""fiction"" and ""fact"" along with the narration and the pictures, because you often wonder how much is educated guessing, and how much is pure fantasy.<br /><br />To some clues on facts & fiction, you have to see the 50 minute ""Making Of"", which is not only very educational about the CG process and collecting and including the paleontologists knowledge into the series, but which also is very funny (Dinosaurs smoking cigarettes and complaining about CG animators).<br /><br />I highly recommend to watch this series before going into the upcoming Disney Dinosaur movie or watching any Jurassic Park (like) movie again. It will surely make you much more critical towards those movies. The Disney Trailers looked especially bad.",positive
"It was so good! It did not have an over the top feminist agenda. It was just a powerful girl doing what she needed to do to get the job done. Very funny and a very nice tribute to Stan at the beginning. Would recommend to all, very action packed and goose was pretty cute as well!",controversial
This felt like a bad movie dressed up with marvel hype and shoe-horned with music and moods at odd moments. None of it felt like a natural story or progression. It was like the writers had a foregone conclusion of what the story should be and they weren't willing to budge to let it flow better. A waste of time.,negative
To make a good movie you either need excellent actors or an excellent director. You need at least one of the two. In this Eye of the Needle we have none.<br /><br />I don't even remember the name of the director. He mustn't have done much in his career. I like very much Donald Sutherland but he absolutely cannot be the main actor in a movie. He falls short. Sutherland is excellent in a movie when he appears for not more than 15 minutes. I would say for instance that Sutherland was excellent in JFK of Oliver Stone when he talked to Kevin Costner on the bench of a park for 10 minutes non-stop without even taking a breath. Wonderful. But Sutherland being the principal actor in a movie is no good.<br /><br />Kate Nelligan? She is probably good for TV series. The DVD is awful. Terrible colors. Terrible light. I couldn't even appreciate the scenery of Storm Island for how lousy the photography was.<br /><br />This Ken Follett story was good but it's a pity they turned it into an uninteresting movie.,negative

"Capatain Marvel felt so disjointed.  With some editing I think it would improve.  Instead of interspersing back story, it would build a better story if it had gone chronological.  Had we gotten to know Carol Danvers as a human, we could have related better to the character, felt more when she lost her mentor, gotten excited when she got her powers.  Felt the sting of betrayal.  But instead, every thing was presented at once.  Disappointing.  (CGI was spectacular).",negative
"I think this is one of those kind of movies that should not have been made; having an origin story about a minor character all of a sudden becoming the main character to save everyone just feels off.  I would rate this film as the weakest MCU to date, I know that Iron Man 3 and Thor Ragnorok were not so great but this movie even them look good.  This is the last jedi of the MCU- if they use captain woke to take down Thanos put a fork in the MCU its done.",controversial

"The other Captain.  So this is about fighter pilot Carol Danvers (Brie Larson).  She is very good at what she does, but like most women, she has to work twice at hard to succeed in her field.  So what is she doing hunting Skrulls in outer space?  Now this was a movie that has been getting some serious traction.  After the Infinity War stinger, you just know that she is going to play a major role in making the universe right again in the next Avengers movie.  Brie Larson is an unapologetic feminist, so it is not all that surprising to see that there have been trolls review-bombing different websites.  Well, that is all for naught, because this is making truckloads of money, so much so that it had the third highest grossing March opening of all time.  Now I knew very little about this character.  In fact, after I saw the aforementioned stinger, I had to go home and look it up, because that symbol didn't really mean anything to me.  I got a bit nervous at the beginning of this, because things were moving fast... almost too fast.  I hate to say it, but I was getting Thor 2 vibes from the first 15 minutes of this.  Once we finally get back to Earth, it does pull back quite a bit and it becomes much more palatable, because then it stops being a space opera without back-story.  That's where it gets to show you what a period piece this is, because this movie is all about the 90s.  It does sometimes get a bit in-your-face with the references, but to be fair, Captain Marvel does this no more than Mid90s does.  Because we are going back in time, this leaves the door open to bring back characters that have already met their end, which is one of the most intriguing aspects of this.  Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) has both eyes, and the reverse aging effects they have on him are next to flawless.  It almost looks like they filmed the same person that was in Die Hard with a Vengeance, and it is impressive.  As much as I wanted to love this, I can only say that I liked it.  I think Brie is great for the role, and I like all the parts that they got for this, but that said, I did find myself wishing that this script sparkled a bit more.  That's not to say that it doesn't have its moments, but this is more formulaic than I would like to see; it does make me feel fatigued to some degree, especially given how many superhero movies we get any given year now.  It does finish strong and given how few female led superhero movies are out there, I can give this a low recommendation.  Plus, it is mandatory viewing so you know what is going on in Endgame.",controversial

Unfortunately this movie sucked.  She just didn't have the super hero character down and she wasn't very funny.  It wasn't believable at all.  The skrolls were a bit of a joke.

"Prix de Beauté was made on the cusp of the changeover from silence to sound, which came a little later in Europe than in Hollywood. Originally conceived as a silent, it was released with a dubbed soundtrack in France, with a French actress speaking Louise Brooks' lines, but was released as a silent in Italy and other parts of Europe. I was lucky enough to see the Cineteca di Bologna's flawless new restoration of an Italian silent print at the Tribeca Film Festival. I haven't seen the talkie version yet, but I think it's safe to assume the silent version is much more satisfying, since by all reports the dubbing is poorly done (Louise Brooks is clearly speaking English, so there's no way her lips could be matched.) Also, the film is made entirely in the silent style, with few titles and little need for dialogue. Prix de Beauté tells its story visually, with exciting, imaginative camera-work. The opening is instantly kinetic, with rapidly-cut scenes of urban life and swimmers splashing at a public beach. Throughout the film there is an emphasis on visual detail, on clothing, machinery, decoration, and symbolic images such as a caged bird, a heap of torn photographs, a diamond bracelet. This is silent film technique at its pinnacle.<br /><br />Louise Brooks, of course, is responsible for saving the film from obscurity. Seeing this makes it only more heartbreaking to reflect that this was her last starring role. Lustrously beautiful, she dominates the film with her charisma and also gives a perfectly natural yet highly charged performance. Her role here, more than in the Pabst films for which she's best known, is a woman we can fully understand and sympathize with. She plays Lucienne Garnier, a typist with a possessive fiancé, who yearns to get more out of life and secretly enters a beauty contest, with immediate success. She is then torn between the excitement of her glamorous new life and her love for the man who insists she give it all up or lose him. All of the characters are drawn with nuance. The fiancé inspires pity and is not merely a brute: he loves Lucienne, but is a limited man who can't cope with her having a life apart from him or attracting the attentions of other men. Even the ""other man"" in the story is not the simple slimeball we first take him for, though his intentions may be just as possessive as the fiancé's.<br /><br />*************************WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW***************** <br /><br />The film has many fine set pieces, including Lucienne's triumph in the ""Miss Europe"" contest, shown through the comic reactions of assorted audience members, who wind up pelting the heroine with flowers; her misery as a housewife, peeling potatoes while the pendulum of the cuckoo clock marks time behind her; a nightmarish trip to a fun-fair (in the silent version, this occurs late in the film, after her marriage) at which Lucienne, crushed among the low-lifes and depressed by her husband's macho antics, decides that she can't go on with her present existence; and especially the final scene in the projection room where she views her talkie screen test. Louise Brooks may never have looked more beautiful than she does here, with the projector's beam flickering on her alabaster profile, her shoulders swathed in white fur, her face incandescent under the black helmet of hair as she watches herself singing on screen. The double shot of her exquisite corpse and her still-living image on the screen is particularly poignant: Louise Brooks' image, like Lucienne's, remains immortal despite her frustratingly aborted film career.",positive
"Robert Lansing plays a scientist experimenting with passing objects through solid matter, but he goes too far one night and unintentionally makes himself four-dimensional! Atomic-age fantasy is rather charming in a very cheesy way. Perhaps it was considered a thoughtful sci-fi in its time (with psychological overtones), yet seen today the film is mildly overbaked and naive; it's a camp-fest tailor-made for TV's late-late show. Wooden performances by Lansing and Lee Meriwether barely rate as one-dimensional, though Patty Duke (playing a cute brat pre-""Miracle Worker"") gets a colorful, memorable exit. <br /><br />** from ****",negative

"Ok, I'm not sure what movie this other fruitcakes went and saw but this Marvel movie was absolutely epic. I never imagined I would see the day where a female lead superhero movie would shatter my expectations! nnAs a father of a little 8 year old princess I fully support her being of fan of Carol Danvers. In a move that supported femininity without bashing men, Captain Marvel stood as an episodic roller coaster of emotions that showed a determined Danvers face impossible odds yet refuse to give up. nnThis is what I want my daughter to do. Time after time she dusted off her knees, and stood to face each adversity life threw at her. This was the perfect set up for Avengers Endgame as it showed how Captain Marvel can stand a formidable foe in the face of the mad Titan. nnThe cinematography was excellent, Brie Larson played the role almost flawlessly, and the movie refused to pander to certain tropes. The chemistry between Danvers and Fury was enjoyable and it was great to see Samuel L. Jackson in such a goofy yet serious character. nnI for one was blown away by the story, the emotion, the suspense, drama, and action. This was an amazing movie that, in my opinion, mopped the floor with Wonderwoman. nnThis was the hero that we needed, and the portrayal of a female superhero lead we deserved. nnI'm appalled at the nonsense being spewed about this movie. Marvel outdid themselves, and set the tone for the next phase of its cinematic universe. nnThis combined the perfect amount of nostalgia and stands as a tribute to Stan Lee's legacy. I'm very critical about movies and I stand impressed. nnThis movie deserves 5 stars, and an iconic place in superhero movie history.",positive

"Not even in the top 15 of the MCU movies. This took about an hour to even get going and was a bit of a train wreck when it finally did. I think Marvel made a mistake by introducing someone so powerful. They even had to dumb her down to make anything believable before it became pointless. Once you notice, you can't unsee that she has her fists clenched the entire movie. She walks around with her fists in a ball, she talks with her fists in a ball...like she was ready for a 15 round fight for the full 2 hours. And now this overpowered new character is going to save the day in End Game?...just lazy writing.  If you are looking for a medicore popcorn flick that introduces a character that will make a difference in the MCU that you've already invested 20 movies in, then go see it. But, for my money, this is marginally better than the incredible hulk. Oh, one final note though.....if you like Sam Jackson (Fury), he is loose and funny in this one....may be worth the price of admission to see him.",negative
With an excellent supporting cast I expected more from Captain Marvel however it felt far too forced and rushed with it's placement in the MCU canon. If you've followed Carol Danvers in her many installments and versions in the comics and marvel animation this is definitely not her best. As cliche as this sounds I believe Captain Marvel would have been much better portrayed by a more rounded lead such as Yvonne Strahovski or Emily Blunt. Definitely the least of Marvel's films even without taking into account the furor regarding identity politics and virtue signalling. ,controversial
"This well conceived and carefully researched documentary outlines the appalling case of the Chagos Islanders, who, it shows, between 1969 and 1971, were forcibly deported en masse from their homeland through the collusion of the British and American governments. Anglo-American policy makers chose to so act due to their perception that the islands would be strategically vital bases for controlling the Indian Ocean through the projection of aerial and naval power. At a time during the Cold War when most newly independent post-colonial states were moving away from the Western orbit, it seems British and American officials rather felt that allowing the islanders to decide the fate of the islands was not a viable option. Instead they chose to effect the wholesale forcible removal of the native population. The film shows that no provision was made for the islanders at the point of their ejection, and that from the dockside in Mauritius where they were left, the displaced Chagossian community fell into three decades of privation, and in these new circumstances, beset by homesickness, they suffered substantially accelerated rates of death.<br /><br />Following the passage of more than three decades, however, in recent months (and years), following the release of many utterly damning papers from Britain's Public Record Office (one rather suspects that there was some mistake, and these papers were not supposed to have ever been made public), resultant legal appeals by the Chagossian community in exile have seen British courts consistently find in favour of the islanders and against the British State. As such, the astonishing and troubling conclusions drawn out in the film can only reasonably be seen as proved. Nevertheless, the governments of Great Britain and the United States have thus far made no commitment to return the islands to what the courts have definitively concluded are the rightful inhabitants. This is a very worthwhile film for anyone to see, but it is an important one for Britons and Americans to watch. To be silent in the face of these facts is to be complicit in a thoroughly ugly crime.",positive

"Ah, Marvel Disney - the cinematic equivalent of Wonder Bread and American cheese. They are as consistent in quality as they are bland. When slathered in butter and pan fried, they briefly provide sufficient comfort and sustenance before resting stubbornly in one's intellectual colon until something more substantive and fibrous evacuates it all from the mind's anus. Feel free to call me a shit head for making that analogy as, for some strange reason, I've come to expect the worst backlash from my Marvel movie reviews, but I don't begrudge those who disagree with me. Considering my review for Aunt Man and the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant garnered plenty of unsolicited and redundant responses, many folks seemed to think my negativity was unwarranted or, worse yet, unfounded. It's easy to forget that not everyone is as smart or important as me, so being called ""pretentious"" over and over really opened my eyes to how I should give the McDonalds of modern film making more critical leniency.nnBelieve it or not, I'm going to double down on why I pity the cognitive toddlers that scurry up to defile my reviews and inbox every time I offer an unfavorable opinion about their favorite brand of banal brainwash. I would liken their fervor about superhero movies to that of sports fanatics, captivated by the ephemeral spectacle of the event only to leave themselves open to ulterior bombardment by advertisers and, if it's a particularly divisive game, ensuing mass hysteria. Sitting in your Captain America shield/Bat-signal embroidered hoodie, you indignantly type ""These movies aren't for you - why do you bother watching them?"" By that logic, if this review isn't for you, why bother reading or commenting on it? I watch a lot of things that aren't ""for me"" if for the sole purpose of making fun of them later.nnI think the question above ultimately translates to one of two implications, the generous reading being ""Why are you so condescending and smug about something as innocuous as a popular film that is designed for mass appeal and that meets the standards and purposes prescribed to it, all the while indicting and judging people who appreciate it for what it is?"" That's a very good question I've vicariously made through me there, and I'm right - people shouldn't feel bad for liking things, even if those things suck. I like a lot of things that suck, but most of them aren't so ubiquitous to the point of invading your sphere of perception. Also, most of them aren't considered cultural landmarks like, for instance, how Black Panther pulled more Academy Awards than, say, There Will Be Blood for no demonstrable reason. Yes, I know making generalizations about a specific group of people is a bad idea in most contexts, but comic book nerds aren't exactly a demographic based on race, gender, or any noteworthy quality. They're closer to ideologues, like Nazis. And the only people who get mad when people make fun of Nazis are Nazis. I'll bet you did not see that coming if you're a stupid comic book nerd.nnThe other reading could be ""I enjoy these movies, you should agree with me, and I'll shitpost anyone who doesn't."" I've never really understood this kind of brand loyalty where one feels the need to defend a work of abstract value, especially when they don't have an academic or financial stake in it, but I suppose one of the several million fifth-unit CG artists could have chanced upon my review to only find some self-aggrandizing jerk bitch about how the poor schlub made his rent last month by poorly rendering the comet trail on Evangeline Lilly's spandexed butt. The great irony here is that a bad review can simply be a long-winded shitpost, bereft of any real insight, and designed to provoke. It could be a big waste of your time, dredging up controversy to compensate for an overwhelming lack of initial interest which itself has become a common method of marketing. I'm sure the creators of Captain Marvel wouldn't know anything about that.nnAnyway, Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) becomes alien Wonder Woman working with the Skeets to fight the Krulls so the Creoles don't get the important glowing item before the Skoals inevitably will. Some fighting occurs. There's a cat present for humor and plot, and Sam Jackson and fan favorite (?) Agent Coulson say things that bolster the 90's setting while Captain Marginalized pieces together her past and struggles with decisions of moral gravity. Important themes that mirror the political zeitgeist include the refugee crisis, minority representation in media, and mansplaining. The biggest surprise to me was that Ben Mendelsohn breaks his typecast and is an antagonist at first. Also, wait for the mid credits sequence because it is book-ended by several minutes of scrolling white text on a black background. I don't want to end up with my shoe in my mouth, but I'm pretty sure there's going to be a sequel. It all comes out exactly as you expected: a cheesy turd.",negative

It was complete garbage I was yawning in the theatre nothing grabbed my attention and really I didn't care about any of the characters. Almost everything in the movie felt forced and like it was trying to be everything but a superhero movie and nothing about the movie was showing where she learned any of her moves like idk flying... atleast in DC movies they show where the superhero started there training and that would include flying. Also it was kinda obvious if you were a fan of Guardians of the Galaxy that you knew that the Cree(not sure how it's spelled) was gonna be an absolute cancer. On top of these things the movie was just boring it felt static and nothing was really on the line except for a race I didn't know or care anything about but also the cat being flung around gave the audience I was with more of an emotional response than the rest of this movie did in its entirety.

"I honestly expected more from this movie. That may have been the problem. There was not one time when the camera was still - ever. On close ups, the camera shakes, the subjects move, and I get a headache. The cuts are so often and so fast, that the viewer often finds himself/herself wondering what just happened. (LOOK OUT, SPOILER ALERT) And at the end of the movie, when you expect to have a happy ending after being put through so much useless thought to comprehend what is going on, they end up losing.

"A first time director (Bromell) has assembled a small but powerful cast to look at the world of a middle aged, middle class, depressed hit-man and his struggle with his relationship with his father. This film in less than 90 minutes presents an incredibly interesting contrast in human nature. David Dorfman as the 6 year old son of William H. Macy is the most refreshing little actor I've seen in awhile. Macy is brilliant in a part that almost seems written for him as a self tortured sole struggling to break the reins of his father and his business. It's always great to see Donald Sutherland and here he's wonderful as the callous father of Macy. The films alternate audio track is well worth it to hear the director explain how he picked the cast, locations, and filmed the movie. The basic dolby 2 channel sound is adequate for this film and well recorded. The cinematography creates the mood along with a very subtle musical background. Any film buff or observer of human nature will enjoy this one especially if he's a fan of contradiction.",positive

"I can't say Captain Marvel is bad really. Just rather bland coming off of the heels of majority of MCU Phase 3 movies. Brie Larson isn't wooden but Gal Gadot, she is not. The action's okay. It's not poorly choreographed or directed but there isn't anything remarkable or memorable about it. Coulson, Korath and Ronan are back! Yay! They're glorified background characters who have little to no effect on the plot. Boo! Has its positive qualities, though. The chemistry between Carol Danvers and Nick Fury is enjoyable, the de-aging CGI looks great and the supporting characters are more entertaining than Carol herself. Especially Goose the cat. I didn't hate Captain Marvel but it seems like the MCU did it. It finally made a movie that's weaker than Thor: The Dark World. Here's to hoping this doesn't seriously affect Endgame.",negative
entertaining but forgettable in terms of history,negative
"I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone I know. The only highlights of this film, are the performances from Sam Jackson and Clark Gregg. And that's it, which is shocking, because Brie Larson isn't a bad actress. I felt like her acting was very wooden, in this film. I don't know if it was the script was just that bad, or the director was.n nIf you're a comic book fan, you will find yourself not happy with this film. A long standing character in Marvel Comics, Mar-Vell, is shamefully gender swapped. The character is a male superhero, in the comics, with decades worth of stories. He is featured as being Thanos' greatest enemy.  In the film, the cinematic version of Mar-Vell is altered to be a female, and does not have a big role in the film.  There is no connection between Mar-Vell and Thanos. Neither is Mar-Vell a close friend of Danvers, as the two are in the comics.  For months, fans assumed that Jude Law was portraying Mar-Vell, only to find out on the day the film was released, this was not the case. Which is a huge disservice to the fan-base that kept Marvel Comics from going bankrupt over two decades ago.nnTo further fuel the rage of comic books, a longtime villainous alien race, is subjugated to becoming the ""good guys"". That's right, folks. The Skrulls are the good guys in the MCU, which is a huge difference from the evil characters in comics. Talos, who is supposed to be the most dangerous of the Skrulls, is treated like a victimized refugee.nnYes, this film has amazing special effects, which is typical of the modern day comic book-based films. And it was amazing seeing how Disney as able to provide a more youthful Jackson and Gregg. But this still felt like a Marvel film we could have lived without. nnFor those intending to go see 'Avengers: Endgame', you will have to see the end credits of 'Captain Marvel', or read about them on the internet. The reason being, is that in one of the end-credit scenes, Carol Danvers makes contact with the remaining Avengers, who all somehow managed to find Nick Fury's secret pager. There is no explanation as to how the Avengers came in possession of the pager, nor how they knew it belonged to Nick Fury.  If you go into 'Avengers: Endgame' without knowing about that scene, you will be left confused as to how Carol Danvers joined up with the Avengers. This alone, is just one giant plot hole. nnThe first and last time I was disappointed with a Marvel film, it was 'Thor: Ragnarok', where it was painfully obvious that the director of that film didn't bother to study the characters, let alone bother studying Norse Mythology. If he had, he would have known that Hela (Hel) is the daughter of Loki, and not Thor and Loki's older sister. And now, 'Captain Marvel' has become the second Marvel film that I'm most disappointed with. nnMaybe Disney should have had the Russos film a 'Black Widow' origin film? Or wait until the Fox merger was final, so they could a film about Laura Kinney (X-23/Wolverine) after that amazing portrayal of her in 'Logan'. nnDisney's first female-led comic book film just could not match up to the amazing Warner Bros film 'Wonder Woman'.",negative
"As with all movies, I separate actors from the roles they play. In this instance it extends to controversial statements Brie Larson has made (that I fundamentally disagree with). So my task was to judge this movie soley within it's own confines.nnWith that said, I think the feminism elements were quite mild compared to how it was marketed. Obviously there are a few scenes where this is more blatant, but not enough to deserve an eyeroll. It never pulls me out of the experience. nnThis movie suffers from pacing issues. This is my biggest critique. There are some sections, the middle being the worst,  where the dialogue drags on, is quiet, and slows progression.  However,  I think it has a solid beginning and and (for the most part) a satisfying, entertaining, ending. However,  to refer back to my pacing issue, there's dialogue between Carol and Nick Fury that is awkwardly quiet at points, and a joke that didn't land before they discuss the upgraded pager.nnAs for Brie Larson's acting, here I didn't have many issues. Her stoic, almost bland, personality is technically explained by the fact that she's largely suffering from amnesia and is a trained super soldier. Her true personality peeps through with sarcastic wisecracks. This comes out more and more as she discovers her identity. I think Carol Danvers will be a unique personality among the Avengers. She has the sense of moral duty like Captain America, but also has the personality of Stark and Strange.nnAction was ok. Special effects were above average. The side characters served their role well.nnIt was a unique origin story as it involved amnesia as the primary engine. Hopefully the pacing issues are solved in the next movie. Overall,  I was satisfied and didn't feel like I was cheated out of cash for the ticket.",negative
"This is not the worst film I have ever seen, but it is the worst Marvel film I've watched so far. I am not a Marvel die hard fan, but I have watched almost every film since Iron Man because I genuinely enjoy superhero films. The story didn't feel new or original. I felt little connection with her character and I never felt any suspense because she is overpowered from the beginning. There are a few plot twist that I felt were completely unnecessary and almost insulting. It really bothered me what they did with Nick Fury considering it contradicts what he has said in a previous film. As a woman I can understand why this is supposedly a big deal since we've never had a female superhero lead her own movie in the Marvel universe, but at this point it feels like their milking their cash cow as much as possible before Endgame. There are other female superheroes in their universe that are already established that I would rather have an origin story to. Captain Marvel is being forced on us and the film shows it. The fact that she's now the most powerful superhero in the Marvel universe is quite disappointing for someone that's been somewhat invested in the franchise since 2008. I would not recommend seeing it in theaters. Wait until it comes out on Netflix.",negative
"I watched this movie on DVD. Such an emptiness after watching the movie in the universe of Star Wars, I did not feel.

"Overall, I give this film a decent 7.6. To start I'll say I love how the character was portrayed and adapted on to the screen. If you read comics occasionally or simply watch DVD extras you'll see the Blade character is drastically different from the one we see in the film. Among the changes, Blade is now most importantly half vampire, therefore acquiring ""all of their strengths, but none of their weaknesses."" The credit for this goes obviously to David Goyer, a fellow fan of the darker genre of comic books. Thanks to him Blade has become a much more interesting character and I find him one of my favorite anti-heroes really. Wesley Snipes is born to play this role, although some would've probably pererred Dezenel Washington or Will Smith (lol). His acting here doesn't need to be exactly Oscar winning per say considering the character but I'm glad he decids to play the DayWalker in the two sequels. Also starring is Stephen Dorff as our main villain and Kris Kristofferson as Blade's Alfred so to speak. The acting is good actually and the action keeps the plot going for sure. The opening scene in the club is one of my favorite parts I've got to say. As much as like this movie there are few things that bother me which take away from this film ranking with something like ""Spider-Man"" or ""X-Men"". Stephen Norrington had the villains portrayed in a way I didn't like so much honestly. Their lines were so full of foul mouthed comedy it didn't really feel like a comic book film to me. Plus ""La Magra"" a bit disappointing as the final villain but the intense sword fight makes up for it I guess. Not to mention a sense of extra non-realism: a black man in a leather coat with a sword beaing the #$%^ out of a cop in broad day light some how going unnoticed by the crowds walking by seemed kinda..well...dumb. Moving away from a few of its flaws, the music by Mark Isham was great and fitted the film nicely. Luckily all these problems are fixed and improved on in the stunning sequel, ""Blade 2"".",positive
"This movie was one of the rolling on the floor laughing movies I have ever seen. Danny De Vito plays Owen perfectly.

Larry is trying to write a book and is having some troubles. Larry teaches a writing class and Owen tagged after Larry trying to get him to read his story. Owen eventually asks Larry to kill his mother, and in return Owen would kill Larry's ex-wife. The whole movie was really hilarious.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of the movie is at the end when Owen writes ""Throw Momma from the Train"".

"This was a riveting film, one that really drew me in. I'm a big fan of William H. Macy, and he puts in a wonderful performance. His great likeability, coupled with the way his character breaks the fourth wall, really gave me a sense of complicity in his actions. I found myself waiting tensely for the whole house of cards to come collapsing down around him (and by extension myself, as his confidante and silent witness). It took several minutes for me to relax once the film had ended, I was so wrapped up in it. <br /><br />Good performances all around, too, not just with Macy.

"I caught this again on the weekend, the first time since the cinema. The film is plagued with clichĂ© model storytelling, and as an origin film its not that eventful. This film is a gap filler for Avengers Endgame and the film has an endgame destination. Not a great Marvel film, but not a horrible film. There's many more bad comic book movies out there, this just ain't one of them. Larson is a little miscast in the role, but that could be from the storyline. Time will tell as this warrants a sequel. 08/03/2020nnAs a Captain Marvel fan, this film fails to ignite her and comes across as a giant feminism driven plot. On the plus side I would like to see young girls going to the cinema and seeing a character like this, but this is no Wonder Women. This fits loosely in the Marvel universe and opens up a lot of plot issues by having a character so powerful missing for so long, maybe a sequel will solve these. The true reason for this film is the connection to Avengers: End Game. Larson is well cast and is extremely talented, it's almost a shame seeing her in a film of this stature. She might be attempting to raise her profile, and this will succeed in doing so, but at what cost? There are a lot of trolls and anti feminist protestors out there and Larson is very outspoken with this passion. I personally didn't love the film, but I get the forced nature of the plotting, it is time for change. The central storyline of getting back up is the key for all the little girls out there and that's one message everybody can use. Not my ideal Captain Marvel storyline or film, but it ends with the character in full swing for Endgame. 19/03/2019",controversial

"Coming from the same director who'd done ""Candyman"" and ""Immortal Beloved"", I'm not surprised it's a good film. Ironically, ""Papierhaus"" is a movie I'd never heard of until now, yet it must be one of the best movies of the late 80s - partly because that is hands down the worst movie period in recent decades. (Not talking about Iranian or Swedish ""cinema"" here...) The acting is not brilliant, but merely solid - unlike what some people here claim (they must have dreamt this ""wondrous acting"", much like Anna). The story is an interesting fantasy that doesn't end in a clever way that ties all the loose ends together neatly. These unanswered questions are probably left there on purpose, leaving it up to the individual's interpretation, and there's nothing wrong with that with a theme such as this. ""Pepperhaus"" is a somewhat unusual mix of kids' film and horror, with effective use of sounds and music. I like the fact that the central character is not your typical movie-cliché ultra-shy-but-secretly-brilliant social-outcast girl, but a regular, normal kid; very refreshing. I am sick and tired of writers projecting their own misfit-like childhoods into their books and onto the screens, as if anyone cares anymore to watch or read about yet another miserly, lonely childhood, as if that's all there is or as if that kind of character background holds a monopoly on good potential. The scene with Anna and the boy ""snogging"" (for quite a stretch) was a bit much - evoking feelings of both vague disgust and amusement - considering that she was supposed to be only 11, but predictably it turned out that Burke was 13 or 14 when this was filmed. I have no idea why they didn't upgrade the character's age or get a younger actress. It was quite obvious that Burke isn't that young. Why directors always cast kids older than what they play, hence dilute the realism, I'll never know.",positive
"A very intelligent and exciting thriller that doesn't rely on action but on situation, which is all to rare these days. I would compare this film to The Day of the Jackal, another film about the pursuit of a dangerous international criminal. The acting across the board is superlative - Aidan Quinn has a tricky double role as the vicious terrorist Carlos and as the Navy man who impersonates him. Donald Sutherland plays the amoral CIA agent who hires him. Ben Kingsley plays the Israeli officer who assists in the plan. This is a very tense and effective film, and it's remarkable considering just how little action there is in it. The first half of the film is all set-up, as the Navy man prepares to impersonate Carlos. The second half is a breathless actioner, the action coming out of the characters and their situations, thus making it all the more gripping. A really tight film that shouldn't be overlooked.",positive
This wasn't a great movie. Brie Larson looks pretty straight faced and too serious half the time ruining many of the scenes.

Although I enjoyed the 90's soundtrack as someone who grew up reading the comics about Captain Marvel this was a bit disappointing. Her cockiness reminded me of Robert Downey's as Tony Stark. Which didn't fit with the scenario of the film. Let alone she was able to harness her binary power with ease. There's was no struggle in the fight scenes or emphasis of vulnerability that builds into her full potential. If so it only lasted a second; she was already great all she needed to do was remember and immediately knew to fly outer space and destroy the ships with a simple blast with no explanation or way of showing how she knew to do that. I couldn't take any of the villians serious even Jude law as Yon-Rogg because Marvel couldn't take them seriously when she could just defeat them with one blast. A strong villian makes a strong super hero and I didn't see it. The cat.... I mean alien cat was entertaining 5.1/-,negative

It jumps around through his past, through his last day, and through some of his stories but is expertly constructed as it moves from section to section. It captures the flavor of the man, his work and of his times...the difficult 1960s.<br /><br />I think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of ""wonder"") are the excerpts from his works. The sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective. They could be used as exemplars for any set designer. I woke up at night dreaming of the Golden Pagoda. <br /><br />The stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art. After watching this film, I wanted to learn more about the works of this artist.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or Japanese history.",positive
"I went in to this thinking another gross movie with gross humor. Telling from my first sentence I don't like that humor and this movie had it's moments but I loved it. Justin Long has really never done comedy like this, where he's sarcastic and clever and I loved it. Lewis Black....enough said. The ending I really did love because It had to take itself seriously I mean how else would you end it? Yes it's another underdog story but not in your typical format and the movie wasn't their ups and downs, it was people coming together for one common goal, To go to college where they were accepted. The cast was amazing and yes I did laugh at loud when I didn't think I would and the laughter lasted longer then I thought to. The parents and sister played their roles well but their characters are put in when necessary. The movie was not focused around them but at the same time they showed up when you expect and not expect them to. They played in to the story very well, and I loved the familiar faces Anthony Heald(Boston Public), Jeremy Howard (I) (Galaxy Quest with Justin Long) Ross Patterson (The New Guy)and Sam Horrigan (Brink). Blake Lively added her certain something to the movie which made it even more enjoyable, as well as B's Friends. I recommend this movie to whoever hated those gross comedies of the last 4 years and really want something with humor and an actually story line!~!",positive
"The film literally dazzles in places, particularly the power unleashed part near the end, but it does not mask the consummate mangling of the original source material nor the injustice it does to the previously established MCU continuity (Nick Fury's eye, anybody?  The complete mangling of the original Mar-Vell's story, right down to forced gender-switching?).  Ryan Reynolds' flight jock Hal Jordan was truer in 2011's poorly received and much maligned Green Lantern than Brie Larsen's Carol Danvers is here.  The only true facet of her character is how she got her powers, and even that rang hollow.  The people behind this film clearly had no familiarity whatsoever with the Kree or the Skrulls.  With the Kree in particular, they missed a golden opportunity to engage in an honest portrayal of the ugliness of racial prejudice.  Carol Danvers as she is presented here is a lame genderswitch guilty of thieving a formerly great story from another character who incidentally was a man.   Ben Mendelsohn was fine in his role, but his character's people are far more complex than the simplified trope we were presented with here and their motivations should be just as circumspect as the Kree.  This story should have been easily as grey as Captain America's last two solo outings, yet it was instead bland, wasting its focus on virtue-signaling instead of building a good suspenseful story (possibly utilizing the comics' Secret Invasion story), thereby missing another golden opportunity.  Instead of a good adventure yarn, a la 2017's Wonder Woman, what we received instead was an overcooked social justice travesty.",negative

"After watching this for 15 minutes I knew how it would end. Its a cliché film with a stupid setup. I'm a big fan of thief films, but this one does not deliver anything new smart or special. It's about an insider heist gone bad because ""hot head-bad guy"" shots a bum, and of course ""do goody-bad guy"" goes on a moral trip. The reason why it's stupid and not believable is. When you've already gone so far to kill a bum, why not just kill the one guy that stands between you and 43 million. They got 45 minutes to stash the money and stage a robbery nobody in there right mind would hesitate to shoot Mr ""do goody"" and in this case he is a guy they known for a few days....

"I went to see Glenn McQuaid's ""I Sell The Dead"" in it's North American premiere at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival. Seeing as this is the second showing worldwide I didn't quite know what to expect of this film, especially having not seen the short film that inspired this big screen adaptation.<br /><br />I'll start off with a slightly more elaborate plot synopsis, without giving away any spoilers.<br /><br />This movie is about Arthur Blake, how he became a grave robber and the interesting and supernatural discoveries that both he and his mentor discovered.<br /><br />The costume and set design in this film were excellent. I was amazed to hear that the entire film was shot in and around New York. The costumes were very accurate to the time, really bringing you as a viewer into the mindset of the time. This movie works just as well as a period-piece as it does a horror-comedy.<br /><br />The interaction between the two leads was very fluid. They played off each others acting with ease. The dialogue between the two was very well written, with Glenn adding his comedic touch even in tense situations.<br /><br />The story is very encompassing and the ball gets rolling from the very start. I'd compare it to a visual page turner, always wondering just what will happen next. The characters themselves are all very vivid and unique adding different emotional layers to the film itself.<br /><br />All in all, I recommend this film for anyone in the mood for some dark humour, with a bit of horror mixed in.<br /><br />9/10",positive

"Jason Bourne sits in a dusty room in with blood on his hands, trying to make sense of what he's just done. Meanwhile, a CIA chief in NYC outlines the agency's response to what's just happened on screen. An American flag stands proudly on the centre of his desk in the foreground of the shot, but as he speaks, it slips out of focus as his plan veers into morally dubious territory, as if it doesn't want to be associated with the course of action the government man decides is necessary in the interests of national security.<br /><br />This shot effectively captures the mood of the film. As well as portraying Bourne's quest to find out how he became Jason Bourne, Ultimatum is also an examination of the human costs of the measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and security.<br /><br />It is also probably the best film you'll see in the cinema this year. <br /><br />It's just so intense. Bourne says to Simon Ross (Considine) ""This isn't some newspaper story, this is real"" and in the audience you almost believe him. The camera shakes, but remains steady enough for you to see everything and feel like you're there with Bourne as he tries to elude his pursuers, and the performances are so good that these guys seem as though they are the characters they're portraying, instead of just being actors performing well-written roles. The action scenes are so brutally fast-paced and well choreographed that they seem instinctive instead of planned to the minutest movement; the stunt-work is nothing short of amazing.<br /><br />The pacing is just incredible. It keeps driving forward towards its conclusion, but not so fast that it leaves you struggling to piece together the plot; the script delivers the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next tense action set-piece. While they're often simple (the Waterloo sequence is essentially just a man on a phone being watched by a man on a phone) they're charged with such dramatic intensity that you can't take your eyes off them. The film is just so focused on powering forwards that you can't help being swept along by it.<br /><br />With its intense action set-pieces, brilliantly paced storyline, and intelligent examination of the decisions made in the name of national security, the Bourne series is one that accurately captures the ambiguities of our age. Ultimatum is its peak.",positive

"Brie Larson apears to have put little to no effort and barely any emotion into this character. Her lines were very weak but made worse by its bland delivery. Digging really deep into the psyche of this movie maybe its fair that her character felt distant from everyone and the humor felt like strangers conversing on line at the post office. She has had her mind and memories skewered. But that's a bit to deep and doesn't explain her terribly bland performance and lack of any background with the kree she has lived and trained with for the last six years. This is only one of the negative aspects of this movie,  their are more unfortunately. I did like the beginning of the movie and the CGI on Hala and the early Kree/Skrull battle. I would watch a whole movie of that!",negative
"I'm uncertain why there seems to be an outrage towards this film. Is it Marvel's best outing? No. It feels more like a movie from Phase 1. It is on par with CA:TFA and Thor. I enjoyed it despite the CGI overload. My main complaint is that every other hero has a weakness (why we love them.) CM is all powerful. It's the humanity of Marvel's heroes that separate them from DC's god like characters. Temporary memory loss is not the same as, let's say, Peter Parker trying to navigate puberty, or Tony Stark's arrogance. I'm glad to say it was a fun popcorn film, but Carol has to power down, or the character will grow tiresome. Go see it. Enjoy. And, quit trying to sabotage films because of your own insecurities. It was time for Marvel to shine the spotlight on a female hero. Even if this wasn't that film. ",positive
"8 days no script that's what the DVD tells you is how the movie was made. It's shot in blurry video that's occasionally used to good effect, but it's really partially naked women sitting around in a room for most of the running time. It is very well acted and this helps a lot. But the killer only shows up once in a long time and the girls/women sit and mope they don't try to escape or do anything too interesting, so the whole thing grinds to a stand still after about 20 minutes. Would have been a good short maybe even powerful. Even for eight days they do very little. Why? Because they had no script. How many movies have been made without scripts. Not too many. I wonder why that is? How many great movies have been made from bad scripts. Not too many. Why is that? Working against this major problem, the direction tries and does some interesting things but with what is essentially nothing. Topless girls shot in dark grainy colorless video sitting around will keep some going for a while but not for the short but too long feature length. Actors again deserve praise, if only there was a script.<br /><br />Also the video quality, or lack thereof, is really low end, they try to use it to advantage and at times some shots look they are from Miami Vice, the recent movie that is. But that's not intended to compliment Miami Vice or this failed venture.",negative

I'll be frank, i went into it having already seen much of the drama playing out all over the internet about this film, so my expectations were low, but i love the MCU so i decided to go in with an open mind and judge it for myself. Wouldnt be the first MCU movie i didnt like if it was bad, so i had nothing to lose. And bottom like it exceeded my expectations. I found it quite entertaining, great action, good story with heart and had many great tie-ins to not only the rest of the MCU storylines, but also heading into Endgame it played quite well. Bottom line in all truth, this movie isnt even remotely as bad as all the drama kings and queen on the various internet platforms would have people believe. I judged it for what it was, a good movie and decent origin story for Captain Marvel. Was it the best movie of the MCU?..nope, but it was also farrrr from the worst imho.

"The Forest isn't just your everyday standard slasher/backwoods cannibal fare, it also has an interesting mix of supernatural elements as well. The story is about two couples that hike into the forest on a camping trip. A cave dwelling, cannibalistic woodsmen and the ghosts of his dead wife and two children soon terrorize them. There is something you don't see every slasher. Director Don Jones gets an ""A"" for effort although the film itself falls flat on just about every level, the acting is just simply average except for Jeanette Kelly who plays the dead wife of the woodsman (Michael Brody aka Gary Kent).<br /><br />The film opens with some beautiful shots of a couple hiking through a valley and into a forest. They realize too late that someone is stalking them. They are both dispatched in typical slasher fare. Our killer uses a trusty hunting knife throughout the entire film, except during a flashback when he implements a handsaw, pitchfork and rusty saw blade to dispatch his cheating wife's lover.<br /><br />The Forest has a good story line but the movie just doesn't work along with it I found it pretty boring with simply crappy acting. 4/10",negative

"This stupid, anti-environment wannabe ""Jaws"" is sad, pathetic, boring, poorly dubbed, and stupid. There is nothing redeeming about it.<br /><br />Plot follows some shark/octopus creature-thingy that appears off the coast of Florida and kills some people (including a boring, stupid couple with a whiny wife and a silent husband who stabs himself with a fork for some reason). His ascent to the surface is always represented by a vague sideshot of something bumpy over and over. It makes no sense, it's horribly boring, and it's conspiracy plot sucks.<br /><br />There are moments of camp that cannot be ignored: the same shot of the boat of the couple of the opening sequence THREE TIMES; the doctor slamming a dying patient's chest twenty times with a difibulator without stopping, even though he's clearly dead; the porno-esque soundtrack; the shot of the couple making love on the beach, with three different thems (""That us is getting ahead of us!"") doing this; the ancient computer that sounds like Kermit the Frog; a beer-guzzling scientist screaming ""I know!"" a la Dr. Smith; the list goes on and on.<br /><br />Oh, and everyone drinks at least thirty bears in the course of the movie (much noticed by Mike and the 'Bots) . . .<br /><br />The MST3K version is their best episode, but it's certainly better than the movie itself.

Why not avoid the whole adventure? Crewmemebers were dying all along the journey. Why she wants to save Seven of Nine only? The others don't count or what? The most ridiculous part when the crew states that getting home is not really the most important thing to them. As the say, ""journey is more important than the destination"". Unbelievable. And at the finale scene the are surrounded by other Federation ships and the Earth is in sight. Nothing about landing, returning to the normal life.<br /><br />Worst ending ever.",negative
"A great opportunity for and Indy director to make an interesting film about a rock musician on the brink of stardom. It could have been a decent film if it would have dealt with John Livien's traumatic past and how it is torturing his psyche. Instead, it is a ridiculous attempt to identify John Livien's life with John Lennon's. John Livien's suicida mother's hero was John Lennon and she wished for him to become as powerful and prolific as Lennon himself. Instead of focusing on John Lennon's musical brilliance, and his wonderful ability to bare himself for others to learn something about their own life, it showed Lennon's legacy to be that of a confused, drug addicted soul, who should looked upon as a God instead a man. I am a huge John Lennon fan and this movie reminded me of another ""crazy"" person obsessed with Lennon, Lennon's killer , Mark David Chapman. Lennon was a man who was brutally murdered by someone else who had an identity crisis with Lennon. Do we need to be reminded of that? John Lennon gave so much to the world with his music and honesty and I was repulsed to see another disturbed person, as the main character in this movie obsessed by Lennon, and not show his beautiful contributions to the world. Yoko Ono graciously honored John Lennon's memory,by making the memorial in Central Park to give his fans a chance to pay their respects, and remember John. Instead the director of this movie chose to use that site to have the killer attempt to commit suicide. I found this so disturbing and disrespectful to Lennon's memory. He was a man of peace who died a brutal senseless death, and to see such violence near this site felt like a revisiting a terrible wound for any Lennon fan. It ruined the movie completely for me . It could have been a decent movie, but it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. Let John Lennon, and his family rest in peace and not be reminded of his vicious murder by this irresponsible movie.",negative

"""The Dresser"" is a small but absolutely wonderful film, brilliantly acted by Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay. How in the world this tiny film attracted enough attention to garner five major Academy Award nominations back in 1983 is a mystery to me, but it's nice to know the Academy can be guilty of a display of good taste every once in a while (of course, they gave the award that year to ""Terms of Endearment""-- after all, they don't want to be accused of showing TOO much taste).<br /><br />Albert Finney is a drunken Shakespearean actor in a production of ""King Lear""; Tom Courtenay is the man who works double time behind the scenes to keep this actor in front of the footlights. It's both hilarious and piteous to see Courtenay's character showering Finney's with attention and affection, only to see his efforts utterly unappreciated and dismissed, even up to the very bitter end. Finney and Courtenay work wonders together, and though Finney gets the showiest moments (he does get to recite Shakespeare after all), Courtenay is the heart and soul of the film.<br /><br />Grade: A",positive

The visuals and overall feel of Captain Marvel are all fantastic and it's a blast to watch from start to finish. However, the story became a little too 'political' for my taste (and many others I'm sure), and Brie Larson's acting was somewhat inconsistent, as I sometimes wondered why she was cast for this role. At times her acting was something straight out of a ""B"" movie, lacking energy and authenticity, while at other moments her acting was passable or decent enough. Mediocre acting and a clichĂŻÂż 1/2 (C)' political story aside, Captain Marvel was a fun (and mostly exciting) film to watch with some cool surprises along the way too. I'm sure the SJW haters will complain about Captain Marvel until they're blue in the face (if they haven't already) but if they're all that bent out of shape about 'another female hero', 'SJW agenda', 'SJW propaganda', blah blah blah; it's time for those crybabies to grow up and accept the fact that our world is changing.

".This film tries extremely hard to be a powerful female driven statement on rising up when knocked down, that it fails because it neglects to emphasize the randomly inserted scenes of our heroine as a youngster getting knocked down and rising up and only makes you realize that this is one of the themes when a montage of all these scenes are put together at the end of the film. Until then, its a comic book film that delivers sparse action and an extremely weak villain played by Jude Law. How can you care about the lead when the entire film is of the lead searching for who she is. Wonder Woman knew who she was, and we felt it, often. Her passion for love, life and the preservation of it at any cost. Captain marvel wants nothing more than to find out who she is. That is boring. Captain Marvel is a predictable clichĂŻÂż 1/2 (C) that offers NOTHING in the way of female empowerment, and offers nothing new to the Marvel Universe. So, she is a human who got her powers from a light speed engine that blew up and she absorbed its energy? This is suppose to help defeat Thanos? HMM.

"I thought that Mukhsin has been wonderfully written. Its not just about entertainment. There's tonnes of subtle messages that i think Yasmin was trying to bring across. And yes, it might be confusing to some of you(especially if you didn't watch Sepet and/or Gubra for 76 times).<br /><br />I bet u noticed how they use characters from the two movies before right? Its really ironic how the characters relate. Like the bossy neighbour is that prostitute from Gubra. And the chick at the snooker pad turns out to be the religious and wife of the pious man in the future. <br /><br />And i absolutely love the voice-overs. Its crude yet awakeningly fresh.

"I'm not a regular viewer of Springer's, but I do watch his show in glimpses and I think the show is a fine guilty pleasure and a good way to kill some time. So naturally, I'm going to watch this movie expecting to see ""Jerry Springer Uncensored."" First of all, Jerry appears in approximately twenty minutes of the film's running time. The other hour and twenty minutes is spent building up this pseudo-farce about trailer-trash, jealousy, incest and deception. Jaime Pressley (who looks hot as HELLLL) is a trailer-trash slut who sleeps with her stepfather (a very unusual-looking, chain-smoking, drunken Michael Dudikoff who finally strays from his action hero persona). The mom finds out about the affair, they get into a fight, they want to take it to the ""Jerry"" show (that's right, no Springer). And then we have a parallel story with an African-American couple. They take it to the ""Jerry"" show. The characters collide. Blah, blah, freakin' blah! Trash has rarely been this BORRRINGG!!!! I was wondering why the hell Springer has millions of fans, yet none of them checked out his movie. Well, now it's TOTALLY obvious!! Whether you love him or hate him, you will hate this movie! How can I explain? It's a total mess of a motion picture (if that's what you call it). It's so badly edited, with scenes that just don't connect, and after a period of time the plot virtually disappears and it's simply all over the map! Just imagine a predictable soap opera transformed into a comic farce. With seldom laughs. <br /><br />My only positive note is a hot girl-girl scene. That's as risque as it gets.

P'tang Yang Kipperbang is still as fantastic as i remember it when i was a 12 year old .This film has a certain type of brilliance that not many films possess. It is engrossing , it is briliantly acted and best of all it makes me feel like a kid again and there isnt many things that can do that. John Albasiny and Abigail Cruttenden's rolls in this film are 1st class and i had forgotten how good they were until now. I urge any parent of teenagers to sit them down and watch this and see if it has the same affect on them as it did on me. P'TANG YANG KIPPERBANG EEHHH! 10 out of 10.",positive
Great movie! Not the best MCU movie but definitely a Must-see. Not really feminist propaganda as some people whined about. Few moments of empowerments still but well-made,controversial
A very flat film and on a par with Iron Man 2 and Thor 2. nnIt's extremely forgettable with no real memorable scene or action sequence. nnAlso for once in a Marvel film the humour misses 90% of the time. nnNot a great film at all. Disappointing after all the hype.,negative
Really cool movie.  Cool villain.  Parallels some of the moral ambiguity of the more recent movies.  Middle of the road as MCU movies go and just a really good movie.,positive
It was an OK movie. I dunno if i should watch again because nothing stood out throughout the movie. It was kinda bland but not totally terrible. The dramatic scene between Danvers and Rambeau doesn't have a deep anchor to warrant such emotions when they meet. The light banter at the very onset between Danvers and Fury is kinda weird. Just a second ago she's this alien and then at a blink of the eye their like best buds or something. Thank goodness I watch this on IMAX could be lifeless on ordinary screens. But like i said it's not that terrible. Pluto Nash was terrible. That's my bar for terrible movies.,negative
"On my Ă˘Best Comic Book Movies of All-TimeĂ˘? list I place Captain Marvel at #36. Shows you the extent of its blandness. It's not offensively bad but it is annoyingly below average. Better than such things as X-Men Origins: Wolverine and Rise of the Silver Surfer but not by much. Captain Marvel being close to that quality is a stunning turn for the MCU and certainly the worst effort the studio has produced in their existence. nnIn a strange analogy, Captain Marvel is to Marvel Studios what the Vietnam War was to America. Controversial endeavor that the powers to be deemed necessary but overall detrimental. To quote Bill Murray's Stripes: Ă˘We've been kickin' ass for 200 years. We're - and 1.Ă˘? Well, Marvel Studios is now 20-1 but that's still a damn good win loss record! Still a fan of the MCU and hoping for a return to glory for the MCU with Endgame.",negative
"It is a solid B+ movie. It's not the greatest or strongest Marvel movie, but it's certainly not the worst. My greatest issue was that the first half felt rushed and a bit forced. It was like they didn't have enough time for thorough emotional character development, and we had to just to accept from one moment to the next that she's shifted into fully accepting her responsibility and role. This is the only negative critique I'd give. All the acting was great, and I really appreciated that there was no false plot points to move the story forward (ahem I'm looking at you Quiet Place and World War Z). Be prepared that Brie's performance is more deadpanned like Paul Rudd's Ant Man than lovable. But the fact that there is zero male savior, that it's predominantly female driven, the redemption of truth and marginalized people - I loved all of that. And what a great non-cheesy movie for young girls to see everywhere, especially those who've been told their whole lives they aren't good enough to make it. If you're critiquing this movie out of your emotional reaction to hating on Brie Larson calling for equality, then take your own misogynistic advice and stop being so emotional.",controversial
"Very good movie all in all, don't believe the hate it's as worth the watch as any other MCU movie.",positive
"""North & South"" the television mini-series is to the 80's what ""Rich Man, Poor Man"" (the first-ever TV mini-series) was to the 70's.<br /><br />It's a fabulous adaptation of the first classic novel in the trilogy from author John Jakes. The story itself covers the two decades leading up to the years of the election of President Abraham Lincoln and the imminent proclamation of the Civil War - North versus South. The intertwining stories evolve around the families of the Hazards (the 'North' in the title) and the Mains and their two central figures of George and Orry who form a friendship whilst embarking on their West Point training in 1842.<br /><br />""North & South"" is a wonderful historic timeline and as I have grown older (and wiser!) it very much interests me to learn about the contrasting attitudes to such controversial aspects as 'Slavery' and 'Abolitionists', and how these attitudes originated.<br /><br />The series also portrays some great characterisation development as we get to know about the friends and enemies in George and Orry's lives, and also the women that stole their hearts as young men. This aspect of the story also uncovers a romantic tale that is set to the turbulent backdrop of the American Civil War.<br /><br />""North & South"", along with ""Rich Man, Poor Man"" is overshadowed by 1977's ""Roots"" as the greatest mini-series of all-time. However, it does come a close second/third and also shares the same kind of timeline and themes as ""Roots"". But, don't let this one get away, even if it's just to see the great scenery, costumes, and brilliant all-star cast including Gene Kelly, Johnny Cash, Elizabeth Taylor, James Stewart, Olivia De Havilland, Lesley-Anne Down et al. <br /><br />The series is beautifully crafted and is firmly tied to actual historic events and it's a pity the Emmys and Golden Globes didn't honour a lot more of the actors and actresses for their portrayals. Patrick Swayze and James Read, the two virtual unknown lead actors at the time, turn in compelling performances as Orry Main and George Hazard respectively. However, it's Kirstie Alley's riveting performance as George's 'Abolitionist' sister Virgilia that steals the show many times. Plus, Terri Garber, David Carradine and Philip Casnoff as Elkanah Bent are the delicious villains of the piece you just love to hate.<br /><br />""North & South"" Books 1 & 2 are now available on two DVD sets.",positive
"Best Star Wars movie and best movie of 2017 for me! I had low expectations, when going to the theater, but I was happy to be proven wrong! A lot of instances are simply EPIC and the design, overall quality is great!",positive
Just trash.  The end of ay big marvel movies after endgane,negative
"Very good movie. I loved how it fit in along with the previous and future Marvel movies. Great story line, acting, and CGI. It is sad that so many are giving the movie an artificially low one star due to their feelings being hurt by Brie's desire for this movie to me more inclusive and motivating for women. There is room for all at the table.",positive
A great movie with a great cast and a lead actress that is SEVERLEY over hated. Brie Larson is a Beautiful Woman and her part as Carol Danvers is great. The ONLY problem I have is the way Nick Fury lost his eye. That's the only reason it's only 4 and a half stars.,positive
"While the new Pride & Prejudice film is gorgeous to view, and the soundtrack is lovely, we are not seeing Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The film is for some reason set back in the early 1790's, rather than the Regency period where the novel is set, as scholars have long shown. The Bennets' Longbourn estate is ram-shackled and looks like Cold Comfort Farm. Yet the Bennets in the novel are gentry class; they own a farm, but the pig does not walk through the house, nor is the farmyard of manure and chicken droppings contiguous to the home. Scenes are re-set from the novel,and lest we forget, Jane Austen placed scenes in certain locations for a reason. For example, the film puts the big Darcy proposal scene outside in a storm in front of a Neoclassical temple, as opposed to inside the Collins' parsonage: Why did Jane Austen put it in the parsonage? Because while Lizzy and Darcy speak with total, if brutal honesty to each other in this scene, the Collinses have never shared an honest word. Why the rain and the outdoor proposal? It looks like Jane Eyre meeting Rochester! And when Elizabeth walks across a windy field to stand on a cliff and view the panorama, one expects her to cry, ""Heathcliffe"" at any minute! Austen has been Bronteized! Judy Dench is a GREAT actress, but Lady Catherine is supposed to be tall and striking. The petite Tom Hollander is a brilliant actor: but Mr. Collins is described in the novel as tall and heavy-looking, which suggests that his terrible dancing with poor Lizzy is elephantine. Matthew MacFayden is another favorite of mine from MI-5 on A&E; in P&P, however, he is more the young Heathcliffe, never smiling--though Austen observes in the novel that Darcy smiles at Lizzy quite a bit, and she realizes this when she sees his wonderful smiling portrait at Pemberley--a portrait that in this movie is for some reason replaced by a sculptured marble bust.And much of Austen's dialogue is changed to modern speech. Mr. Bingley has been turned into such a clown that one wonders why Darcy would have him as a friend and why Jane Bennet would love him. The bottom line is that while this is a great movie to watch and hear, it deviates from Jane Austen's novel so much that any student who watched it, thinking she could substitute viewing for reading, would fail!",negative
"It hurts me that I am giving a bad review on a Marvel movie, but it was quite slow and as a woman I did not feel empowered. The movie has several feminist lines which I feel kind of ashamed how hard they were trying to put women above men. ",controversial
"I have seen this movie a whole dozen times and it's awesome. But the only thing with it was that in the beginning, there was too much talk of who's going out with who. I think that it would be interesting to do a remake of it. But on the official site, they said that they will not be making a remake of it because so many people have gotten saved when viewing it. What's even happened to Patty Dunning now? She is a pretty good actress. She has done several other movies in the 70s and 80s, but we haven't heard from her since. I know for sure about Thom Rachford, who plays Jerry, works for Accounting at RD Films. But overall, I have to say that the series itself is like Left Behind gone old school.",positive
"Great classic MCU movie, ignore the haters. ",controversial
Good movie! Wife and I thought it was entertaining and certainly worth the $. I was concerned early on about the very poor reviews but now believe there was a lot of trolling from people with some misguided agenda. If you like the other other Marvel movies go see this one too!,controversial
"This movie is getting a lot of hate. Most likely from people that didn't even see it. I thought it was a great movie. It was well written. It was funny and not that forced kind of humor that can ruin a film. It was genuinely funny. Brie Larson brought this character to life and did it amazingly. My opinion only matters to myself just like all the other reviews. Reviews don't make a movie good. So see it for yourself. If you don't like the movie fine, but don't bomb the reviews just because you don't like the actress, because at the end of the day it is a marvel movie and it is going to make money. A lot of hard work went into the film and it definitely shows. I am excited to see Brie Larson in End Game with the rest of the amazing cast! You go girl!",positive
"This was the best movie I have seen in a while! I took my kids (boy and girl) and my girlfriend. Everyone loved it! There were multiple laugh out loud moments and some great tidbits of 90s glory. Ignore the haters and see this movie. If you have the opportunity to see it at a Drafthouse theatre, get there early for the pre-show!",controversial
"I do think the movie had some very good parts. You are drawn in by the emotion and the plot turns. However, there are some critical star wars elements that are missing, the plot is very disjointed and has no destination. And there is little to no set-up for the next movie. Not a fail, but a definite disappointment. ",negative
"When this series aired I watched most of it. I think it was supposed to be a long running series in the vein of ""The Fugitive"" and ""The Incredible Hulk"" where the protagonist is being chased around the country looking for a solution to his problems. In this case the hero's problem is his progressive aging in reverse. I liked what I saw of these shows. The acting was good especially the sorrowful relationship between the lead character and his wife. Problem is: They cancelled it before it had a chance to end. (either that or I missed the last episodes).<br /><br />They never got a chance to wrap up the story either, knowing it had been cancelled. Poof it was just gone. However, like I said before I might have missed the last episodes. But my proof to the contrary is this: I rented the tape. Where I left off in the series. The lead character's wife dies in a fire started by a chase involving King's famous organization the Shop. While getting away hero is kidnapped. It ends with his friends realizing they have to go save him from the Shop. The end. Last episode. On the video: His wife does not die but escapes the fire with him. Right when he should get nabbed by the Shop, he and his wife share a weird moment then phase out of existence. Abrupt, silly and cheap to the extreme. They just wanted to put this video out and decided to tag on an ending not caring how bad it was. They might as well of just shown some stock footage of the first atomic bomb detonations. Almost Pythonesque.<br /><br />The show did have a cool opening title sequence set to the David Bowie song of the same name",negative
